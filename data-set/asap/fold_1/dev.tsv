1	1	"Dear local newspaper, I think effects computers have on people are great learning skills/affects because they give us time to chat with friends/new people, helps us learn about the globe(astronomy) and keeps us out of troble! Thing about! Dont you think so? How would you feel if your teenager is always on the phone with friends! Do you ever time to chat with your friends or buisness partner about things. Well now - there's a new way to chat the computer, theirs plenty of sites on the internet to do so: @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, facebook, myspace ect. Just think now while your setting up meeting with your boss on the computer, your teenager is having fun on the phone not rushing to get off cause you want to use it. How did you learn about other countrys/states outside of yours? Well I have by computer/internet, it's a new way to learn about what going on in our time! You might think your child spends a lot of time on the computer, but ask them so question about the economy, sea floor spreading or even about the @DATE1's you'll be surprise at how much he/she knows. Believe it or not the computer is much interesting then in class all day reading out of books. If your child is home on your computer or at a local library, it's better than being out with friends being fresh, or being perpressured to doing something they know isnt right. You might not know where your child is, @CAPS2 forbidde in a hospital bed because of a drive-by. Rather than your child on the computer learning, chatting or just playing games, safe and sound in your home or community place. Now I hope you have reached a point to understand and agree with me, because computers can have great effects on you or child because it gives us time to chat with friends/new people, helps us learn about the globe and believe or not keeps us out of troble. Thank you for listening."	4	4		8																					
4	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 I have found that many experts say that computers do not benifit our society. In some cases this is true but in most cases studdies show that computers can help people. While nothing beats talking in person computers can get really close such examples are webcams or e-mail. @PERCENT1 of students who get good grades refer to reliable websites for reasearch or to help find good books. Also online catalouges or advertisments help the economy of stores worldwide. @CAPS2 people were not allowed to use computers most of the modern would not exist. @PERSON1 said that the best form of modern communication is the computer because of the ability to write, talk, or write back for much cheaper! Almost every single event i go to is planed on a computer by communication such as e-mail ""@CAPS2 a student ever needs homework because lam out sick or needs help studying for a test then contact their teacher through the best form of communication for them always e-mail. Even the post office uses computers to get letters and boxes to people. The president of the post office, @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS3 would be imposible to get mail to our coustmers @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for computers telling us where a zip code is or how heavy a box is."" @CAPS4 that tell people what is happening around the world would not exist @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for the moder communication abilities that computer provid us. Because information can be commucated so quick. so can reasearch. When the country of @LOCATION2 took a pole @PERCENT2 of people used computer for any type of reasearch, of those @PERCENT3 were students currently in school and @PERCENT4 of them have good grades. When the same survey was taken in the @LOCATION1 @PERCENT5 of people used computers fore reasons and @PERCENT2 were students who had good grade @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not posible for me to access documents in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 online I probably would not have gotten an A+ on my @CAPS7 assignment! Could you amagine @CAPS2 suddenly your Newspaper reporters couldn't use the internet to work on their reports? The articles would probably be @NUM1 after the events occur. Most buissness, including the Newspaper, use the internet to advertise, shop, or read. The association of @ORGANIZATION1 reported that in @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 used a website and of them @PERCENT5 were in good positions. The president of @CAPS8 @NUM2 imports said that they use an online catalouge because @CAPS3 is cheaper, but they can also promote that @CAPS3 is to save trees, or for the castomer's convinence. Small @ORGANIZATION1 can make websites to promote them selves and explain their star to potential coustomers. @PERSON3, the owner of @ORGANIZATION2's said that the internet saved her resturant. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 wer not for the internet @NUM3 more people would be jobless in @LOCATION3. In conclusion computer help everyday people and without them most convinences would not exist. They help communicate around the world. Computers help people reaserch subjects for school reports, and they make the current economy get better everyday. In moderation computers are the most useful tool out there."	5	5		10																					
9	1	"Dear reader, @ORGANIZATION1 has had a dramatic effect on human life. It has changed the way we do almost everything today. The most well know, is the computer. This device has allowed people do buy things online, talk to people online, and also provides entertainment for some people. All good qualities that make everyones lives easier. Imagine you look into your refrigerator and you notice it's almost empty. Someone is using the car and you need to go grocery shopping and the store is too far. What do you do? Well you could go on a computer and look for food online. Ther are many great deals and some companies even deliver for free! The amazing and easy way to buy food without leaving your house. But food isn't all you can purchase. Many products are sold through the computer. Need new toys for kids? Or how about a new hat for your friend? Maybe even more curtains for your room? Well at the easy access of internet on a computer, you can buy all those items and more. The computer has also the way of communication. Let's say someone wants to talk to a friend or relative that lives far away in another country. @CAPS1 someone dosen't own a phone or @CAPS1 they can't make the call, all these is to be in you on the computer. You can communicate with anyone just by using your email adress. Now friends and families can talk to each other over the ease of the computer. Just type to want to say and ""boom,"" instant, on the chat. Let's face it. No matter what a child or even teenager . But now with a computer all that can change. With just one click you could actually be watching a movie from the comfort of your own home. But what @CAPS1 you don't want a movie? No entertainment like listing to musics, watching fun, and probable the most popular playing games. Everyone loves to play a game every once in a while, and with the selection of thousands of online games, these isn't or person who can't fled atleast our game enjoyable. There are even games for educational fun that many kids love. With all the entertainment a computer can produce; who could hate it? All in all the computer is a revolutinizing device that has changes the way we shop, communicate, and find exciting entertainment. To be able to do so much with just a couple clicks; new that I find extravagant. It blows my mind to see and think, ""@CAPS1 we can do this now, I wonder what we can accomplish in the future."	4	5		9																					
31	1	"I agree that computers deffinately are an advantage to our society. I think this because they help us communicate and video chat with family and friends online, used as a great tool with school work, or work purposes. Most of all for the enjoyment of children and now the fun computer games help them prepare for real life consequences,like how the game webkinz teaches kids to care for pets. ""@CAPS1 you have a @CAPS2?"" @CAPS3 @CAPS4, my @CAPS5. ""@CAPS6, please friend request me"", I replied. Later that night, I get home and check my @CAPS2, a new notification pops up and I am now friends with my @CAPS5 @CAPS4. My entire family is on @CAPS2 and I think it's so usefull for several reasons, like making plans and parties. I hate writing invitations, but now every year for my birthday party I just type them up, taking less than five minutes. Or, for an even simpler way of sending invatations you can even just type an email or @CAPS2 message. In fact, I just got invited to a party yesterday over @CAPS2. It's so easy, you just create an event and tag all of your friends in the note. Also, it's so easy to get @CAPS13's because you automatically get notified. Technology like this drastically makes life easier. For example, have you ever gotten something new and just can't wait to show your friends? Well, now you can, in the comfort of your own home. All you need is a webcam and you can instantly connect with one of your friends that have one too. ""@CAPS14, @PERSON1! I love what you've done to your room, the pink wallpaper is so cute!"" I said. ""@CAPS15 you! I love your hair today. It's so pretty,"" says @PERSON1. I love webcamming with my friends because you can see and hear them as if they were in the same exact you. As you can see, webcamming is so much easier than spending more time money, and my moms time and getting a ride over her house. Computers make life so much more convienent. Another example how this is so much easier is now computers help you with school work. Have you ever had to write a report? Well, now many times teachers especially enjoy them typed because many students have messy hand writing and most kids won't like writing it anyways. Like myself, I type faster than I write and that's why I agree @PERCENT1 that computers benefit society. Most importantly, computers can help you find a good job online and even help type a great resume for you. How impressive would that be? If I was applying for a professional position of a job, I know I'll type my resume. In conclusion, that's how computers are so helpful, beneficial, important and fun to our society."	4	6		10																					
38	1	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 in the society we live in, more and more people are using computer including me. The computor in my opinion has to be one of the best inventions ever. The bad part is that these ""exports"" think spending time on the computer is a bad idea when they fail to see the good in computers. Student can use computers to get information on almost about anything, you could use computer to talk to friend and family members, and you confuse it as a navigator to find directions to a certain location if you cant find your way or if your lost. One of the best things about computers is that you can find various amounts of information. That opition is useful for children that attend school , looking to find information for a certain project they need to finish. You can also use the information on the computer to study if your textbook isnt doing you only good. Also if a student is looking for a job in their local area they look on the internet for jobs needing employees. Computers also can be used for communication. You could have a long lost realtive you havent spoken to in a while, you can easily find him on the internet. Online communicating is also good for chatting with schoolmates if you forgot the homework or need help with homework. Im not a big fan of this but online chatting can be use for online dating if your to lazy to go out. One of my favorite options on the computer is that you can use it to navigate a certain location you want to go to. Lets just say you forgot where a relatives house is you can easily type in your address and his address and easily get directions. You can use this method for almost anywhere you want to go. If this did not convince you that that a computer is a great piece of technology, then your crazy. The computers is like a magical box that can be used for anything so I advice you get one."	4	4		8																					
40	1	"Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1 I am @NUM1 and I go to naylor school. I am writing to you convince that computers have a positive effect on people. Please read the following reasons. Computers have a positive effect on people. Your able to communicate with people all over the world. When my brother goes on the computer he get's to talk to my family in @LOCATION1 I like to use skpye because when we talk to family in @CAPS1.R we use a webcam to keep in touch with my family. They teach hand eye coordination and help me in ping-pong. It help me wacth the ball in computer and I do the same in the wreak. You have lot's of access to different information, my mom found a job in the computer. Everybody have access to weather or news, Some say it's a lack of exercise. People get addicted to the computer. Some can get obese and mess with your love life. These are the reasons why I belive computers are good for society. This is why people should agree that advance in technology. Technology keeps on upgrading."	4	3		7																					
41	1	I think computers are good because you can talk to your friends and family on the computers. People needs computers to look for a job. Some people spend to much time on the computers then on homework people need to stop.	1	1		2																					
48	1	"Have you ever had the time completely fly by while you're on the computer? You go on at @TIME1pm and all of a sudden it's seven at night. People should spend less time on the computer because they should be outside, it takes away time with your family, and there are other ways to look up information. You should be outside, enjoying the fresh air and playing sports, not stuck inside all day with your eyes glued to a screen. When you're on the computer all day, you're just sitting there. You're not moving around at all. Seventy-two percent of kids who spend all their time on the computer are over weight. Being on the computer on a beautiful is like blocking out the birds' songs on the first day of @DATE1. Nature is amazing, and you should be outside enjoying it, not cooped up in a stuffy room leaning over a man-made machine. People should spend a lot less time on their computer. When you're on the computer, time really flies by. You lose your whole day to it, and wouldn't you rather be doing something more fun? You can be alone on the computer in a dark room. You should be with your family and and friends. Computers are going to be around for a long time, and when they die down it will only be because something better came along. Your baby brother won't be a baby forever and your grandparents might not even be there tomorrow. Don't you want to spend as much time as you can with them? You're changing too, so you @MONTH1 be off to college or have to move far away for buissness. ""They grow up so fast. They're adults in a blink of an eye."" my grandma said to my mom. Almost @PERCENT1 of parents feel that same way. So, don't spend all your time alone with a machine, be with your loving family and chairish each moment. People should spend less time on the computer because there are other ways to look up information and learn about new places. There are so many books in the world, about any topic you can imagine. Using books to look up information is better than typing in the word into google because it's important to learn how to use an index and find the book on the shelf. A trip to the library @MONTH1 not be your cup of sunshine, so if you want to learn about a place, why don't you go to that place? If you're doing a report on @LOCATION2 for school it would be a lot of fun to go to @LOCATION2 for a few days to learn about it. And you can take pictures with your own camera, not just a picture you found online. It would be a really fun family trip. Even if you're doing your report on a place as boring as @LOCATION1, you could still probably have a lot of fun, hanging out with your family together. In conclusion, people should spend less time on the computer and more time being outside, with family, and at really fun places. Why would you want to stare at a screen all day when you could be having this much fun?"	6	5		11																					
49	1	"Dear local newspaper, I am writing this letter to you to show on how people get effected from computers. It effects people very well and teaches people many things for just one technology. Computers effects many people for what it does. Computers have many advantages that people learn very quickly. Many people love computers. It is one of the most best inventions to everyone around the world. They teach positive things for people to learn. Computer even have a positive effect on people across the world. They teach many things for people to learn and that have already learned. Such as, hand-eye cordination. When you type up words it teaches you to see better with your eyes. Computers also, give people the ability to see, understand, and gives information about people across the world. Celebraties are very popular on computers or other technologies. Computers help you learn things better than any other technologies. Anything you can get on any other technologies. There is a guarantee of you will find it on your computer. Computers are just like other technologies but in some categories they're much better than the others. Computers are very important in life because without computers we would not learn how to communicate with each other. If we did not have phones to use to call someone. On the computer if you go online you can maybe talk to someone by their email address. You can talk to someone that you have not talk to in years. You can look images or videos that you haven't seen in years. On computers, you can find out information from news that week of or even the day of. In conclusion all I say is that without computers in this world. What would it be like? Most technologies that are not as good computers will be popular without computers. I wonder what it will be like?"	3	3		6																					
54	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1! I am an @NUM1 grade student at @PERSON1. I was reading your paper and I notice you had an article on how people are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time going outside, getting exercise, enjoying nature, and that it doesn't benifit society. i completly disagree with these comments. let me explain... Having computers definatly benifits for all students. Sometimes kids forget their text books at school. But if they have a computer, they can just google the information. That way they get there homework done, and don't have to take a zero. Another thing is, I am sure you have heard of a website called, study island. If you havn't, i'ts a website for all the students in the @LOCATION1 to take online courses for math, reading, and science. They are time consuming, but they count for a huge chunk of our grade. So, if we get an @CAPS2 on study island we get an @CAPS2 in one of our classes.. Not only does the computer help students but it helps me in a kind of personal way. I love the piano. But, there are no instructions in my area. However, there is a program on the computer called synewnisia. It helps you learn all kinds of songs on your keyboard or piano. The piano helps my hand-eye coordination as well as it teaches discipline and dedication. Now, synewnesia isn't the only free instrument learning program. There are many others! This helps people who can't afford lessons, and learning an instrument can help you acheive things later in life. Now, one thing you said in your article is that people aren't getting enough exercise because of sitting in front of a computer all day. This is not completly true. In fact, most people go on the computer researching diet plans or local gyms. How do I know this? Well one day when I went on google the top search of the day was, ""weight watchers diet plan"". Also, my mom uses an online video workout website, for her bad back. So not only does the computer help for diets, they can help physical therapy also. So with this letter I hope you realize that the computer does benifite our society, yes, we should not spend too much time on it. But, online learning sessions can be time consuming. It helps many people figure out the right deit and workouts so they can stay happy and healthy."	5	5		10																					
59	1	"You @MONTH1 find this hard to beleive, but many people think computers put a negative attitude on people. Now you @MONTH1 be saying thats not true, that everyone has a computer, but the truth is they don't and they believe it puts negative attitude on people. People have many reasons for owning a computer and one is friends. Did you @CAPS5 some people own computers because they want to stay in touch with friends from differnt states who live far away. For example, many people use @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 to connect with friends. I can make a connection because I have both a @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 that I use to stay in contact with family friends from all over. Some people, like myself, even have friends from different countries! I @CAPS5 that many people want to learn about people from differnt countries and this is one way to do it right now I am learning some new things about the @LOCATION1 because I am friends with someone who lives in @LOCATION2. While on this wonderful adventure of learning you @MONTH1 even get yourself into a vacation adventure. A recent test was taking stating that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people like to travel but don't @CAPS5 where. Some people say that people spend to much time on the computer but not enough enjoying nature.These people are wrong if one is on a computer and they are chating with someone from a differnt state or country then that person might persuade them to take a visit there. For example they would be able to go to the internet type in the place they want to visit and get photographs and information about the place. As a result, people would still get to enjoy nature. Sometimes using the computer could be educational. Many people @MONTH1 disagree with that statement but its true. For example when on the computer many people in their senior year of high school use it to take online college courses to get their degree because going to a regular college @MONTH1 affect their work scheduale. This could also help students in any grade learn more about the topic they are studing. It would also help them on their reports. For example they would be able to get pictures and other information anytime they wanted to. As a result, the students grades would increase. I hope many of you agree with my statement and help spread the word that computers could be positive on the mind. As a result for those who didn't agree with the statement that they are positive not negative I hope that you will redecide on your opion."	4	4		8																					
61	1	"Do you spend all or most of your freetime sitting at your computer? People are spending too much time on computers. Obesity is a growing problem in today's society, people need to interact with eachother, and we need to get some fresh air. Computer are ruining these things for people. Unplug yourself from your computer. More and more people are becoming obese. This is do to spending too much time sitting down in front of computers. There is absolutely no exercise involved with being on your computer. People need to get outside and go jogging, play games or ride their bikes. Cutting back on computer time would cut back on the obesity problem in our society. Top scientists and researchers say that it is extremely important for people to interact with others face to face. To our whole life, we will have to interact and socialize with others. If you don't develop these skills, you won't be happy where you end up. Talking to people over the computer is nowhere near close to talking to someone face to face. Get out and get some fresh air. Go experience nature. Bring out on the beach, hiking in the woods or even just sitting on the swing in your backyard can be the most. Fresh air clear your mind. Time says that kids who spend time outside receive better grades than they would if they were inside on the computer. People need to releave stress so go outside. Click turn off your computers and get out of your chair. Go get some exercise, go interact with friendsand family, or even just go outside and get some fresh air while relaxing. People are wasting too much time on their computers and it's flushing our society down the toilet, so just turn off your computer."	4	4		8																					
66	1	"Wouldnt it be great to use computers in everyday life? In this country we can. You can use it to talk to people you never thought you would see again. Looking at places far away is always an option. You can even simply use it to help with homework essays. Locating and researching, even going to different countries, even different continents is possible to do on the computer. You can buy plan tickets. reserve rooms, even reserve tables at resturants in different countries by just a few clicks. Another thing is, you can research countries, towns, and cities with google instead of having to go out and get books. Reading about and talking to people from different countries is always an option. Being able to talk. and read about people and go to countries just by a clicking a button is pretty amazing. Computers also allow us to talk and communicate to people when there is no other way. The computers give people the ability to talk and see people they they the would never communicate with anymore. An example of this is my father hadn't see his father since he was two, but he started communicating with him and we were able to see him and chat with him through web chat. So these web chatting websites; ooVoo, facebook, myspce, skype, etc, is allowing people to reconnect. This advantage is allowing friendships and relationships to continue, is that really bad? Computers can help people with their homework and essays. For instint, they can type and print their essays instead of having to write it on paper. This helps because first it makes their, it also can be changed quicker and easier. They also can get information about what they are studying quickly and more efficiently. Instead of searching for a word in a big dictionary they can use an online dictionary and just have to type in the word. Online dictionary also have prounociation help and different langages. This helps so much so they can get their work done and exercise, enjoy nature, or interact with family and friends. I hope you will take my opinion seriously and think about it is using computers for daily needs really that bad?"	5	4		9

Computer not only teaches hand-eye coordination, but @CAPS3 gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people,and millons people to talk on line with other people. @CAPS1 friend wasn't the only person who learn hand-eye coordination. About @PERCENT1 of people learn hand-eyes coordination using a computer. @CAPS3 might takes some month to learn, but once a child knows @CAPS3, they will be outside for hours. Who would not want to learn hand-eye coordination? In addition, computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people. Computer engineer, @PERSON1, says, ""@NUM1 in every @NUM2 people learn about places and people threw the internet."" @CAPS3 will take a few hours, but you will be educated. Why would someone think we are spending too much time in the internet if we are being educated? Addionally, don't you have a friend who live more than @NUM3 miles away from you?

81	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I think that using computers is a good thing and it does not effect on exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Here are three reasons to support my oppinion people learn more on the internet, children at school can go online to find what was for homework, and how the internet does not effect everyday life. My first reason why I think using computers is good because people learn more on the internet, You know what people say, you learn something new everyday. Well, if you are wondering about something or if you're think about something, the internet can help you find what you're looking for, @ORGANIZATION1 is a great site to find what you're looking for. It also has its own images if you need a picture for your project you need. My second main reason to why using the internet is good because if your a @CAPS1, you can go online to check what you have for each subject. If your a @CAPS1 and you don't want to do homework at recessthe next day from being sick. No, you can go online to your schools website and click on your teachers names to see what you have for homework. This way you can still have time to go out side, play with friends, and interact with family members. My third and final reason to why using the internet is good is that it effects everyday life, in a good way. If you don't have a t.v. and you have no idea what the weather is like, you can go online to see if it's going to be snowy, or rainy. This can tell you if you need a jacket or a rain jack, if you need to use a shovel or hold an umbrella. The internet can be useful in everyday life. In conclusion, I think using the internet is very good and will not effect your exercise, or interacting with family. To support this I stated, people learn more on the internet now, children can access homework if you missed a day, and how the internet effects your everyday life in a good way."	4	4		8																					
83	1	"Dear Newspaper Computers have been a great learning source and i think it's time we give them some cridit insted of worrying over them. I will be telling you about how I think computers are great. One reason they are vary helpful is that books dont always have all of the information. So if you need to know a fact or need more information for a project you can go on the computer and it's all right there and you will have known more facts then when you started. The second reason is that you can be almost anywhere and half acess to a computer and you might not have a phone but you can talk or send a message. Not everyone has a phone but computers are a secondary way to have a conversation with someone. Another reason, is its not always sunny outside and when it is a rainy day you have a fun way to play and learn without having to be outside. The computer dosnt replace the outdores or exercising it is just a passtime when you dont have the oppertunity to be outside. I hope you liked and understod my reasons and will take them in to concideration when going over the topic."	3	4		7																					
92	1	"Dear local Newspaper; @CAPS1 you know that computers teach you to do many things? You probably do! I understand you would like to know my opinion on whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Well, I think that it has a positive effect. Computers teach you how to type and learn the moun keys. It also helps you to look things up like people, states, and etc. Lastly, it helps you to interact with other students when not in school. i encourage you to continue reading to hear my wonderful and strategic ideas. First of all, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the learning skills to learn how to type I remember last year in @NUM1 grade, the tech ed teacher, ma @LOCATION4, told to go on a website that was all about learning how to type. It told us that the main keys were. A,@CAPS2,@CAPS3,@CAPS4 and @CAPS5,@CAPS6,@CAPS7, and colon(;). It was very helpful. From then on I typed like that. I think that learning how to type is an excellent thing. Typing helps you if you want to become a secretary or even a newspaper editor. My mother is a secretary down town at the low form called: @ORGANIZATION1. She works for three houses so she learned to type really fast. Typing is a big part of your life. You can use it for a project that you have to do for class, or an essay lthat you have to type to apply for a scholarship ro colege. Typing is used everywhere, even in math class my teacher types up things and pits them on the @CAPS8 @CAPS9. In addition, computers have a positive affect on people because they help look up famous people, states, countries, and etc. I remember on @NUM2 grade I @CAPS1 a project on @CAPS10, and in @NUM3 grade I @CAPS1 a powerpoint on I've also done a project on @LOCATION1 in @NUM1 grade, I @CAPS1 one on @PERSON1 this year for music, and I'm beginning one on @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3. As you can tell, I've been using a computer, basically my whole life, except when I was a baby, but now that I think about it, when @CAPS11 a baby I got a little fake computer. i know computers are @LOCATION1 but they do have a positive effect on people. When was the last time you need a computer to help you look up something or someone? Priority not too long ago. Computers are the real dael. They can help you do anything. They've helped me my whole life. To be continued, computers have a positive effect on people. They help interact with other people students, and fa mily members, when not in contact. I remember when my cousin moved away. i was so sad. I didn't went her to leave. So then she gave me her email to contact her on the computer so I could talk to her. The computer has many websites where people can interact like: @CAPS12, @CAPS14, @CAPS13, aol, msn, yahoo, g-mail, twitter, and many more. i like talking to people from all over the country. I talk to my friend when I'm at home. i talk to family members. My favorite website is @CAPS14. I am a fanatic of it. It'@CAPS2 spo much fun. Do you have a favorite interaction website? @CAPS1 you have any interaction websites? If you don't you should get one. This is why computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion, i think that computers have a positive effect on people. One because they can interact with others. Two: they can look up things to help them. Three, they can develop a sense of typing. Thank you for reading my letter which I 'm sure has persuaded you to agree with me on how computers have a positive effect on people."	5	6		11																					
99	1	"Dear @CAPS1: Have you been sent a photo of a @NUM1 year old child with no clothes on? Well, if you have this is called sexting. It can be put on the computer or any type of device. People should stop using Computers more because it can lead to bad things like sexting from teens, bad for the younger kids, and teens could be, talking to someone they don't know. Lexi @NUM1, says that ""she has goting facebook texts to her cell phone of other teenage kids that are excuset"". @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 population teenagers have @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 chat. Any of these websites can ford photos to their mobile device. This has goting out of the hand and what ever is on the computer now will be on forever. More childern under the age of @NUM3 years old are on the computer know. Where there are chat rooms were they can interact with others. For example, @PERSON1 is a childerns game that has a chating interaction, were you can talk to who ever. But, we you create this @PERSON1 you child has to give a parents email address were they have to read the following terms to chose for their child. But, most parents don't even read it . @PERCENT2 of these parents just agree to these terms and don't even read them. @PERSON2, was followed home from soccer practice when a man about @NUM4"" and around the age of @NUM5 said ""@PERSON2 come get some candy"" @PERSON2 said ""how do you know my name""? ""@CAPS5 said cause I play with you all the time"" @PERSON2 quickly ran home and @CAPS5 told his parents. @PERSON2 plays on @CAPS6 another intraction game and told this stranger @CAPS5 lives in @LOCATION2 field and @CAPS5 goes to @LOCATION2 @CAPS7. Giving strangers you information they can trace you down and find the street you live on. We need to keep our children safe and off of the computers more so sexting, and young children stay off, so kidnapping stops. Help @LOCATION1, @CAPS8 to become a safe place for our childern."	4	4		8

Maybe people know what they are doing and have to stay on computers for a long time. They also might like to learn things that they never thought about learning. Most people try not to be overweight. Experts should Not try to have less people on the computer. One reason is that people can chat with one another. It can be friends, families, and more. About @PERCENT1 of people chat online with families or friends. Chatting can also help you like if there is an emergency. You can tell someone what is going on and call the cops. Without a doubt chatting online is a great way to use the computer during the time your on it. Another reason is that you can search anything you need to know. Maybe if you have to search something for school, the computer can help you. This can have positive effects on people. It can make someone a better person. You can't agree that getting to search anything is a fantastic way of using a computer for a while. A third reason is that it can teach you hand-eye coordination and gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Learning about things you have never dreamed about learning. There are many people and places in the world that you still have to learn about. Is it surprising to you that almost everyone and anyplace that is famous is on the internet. Using the computer this way is another terrific idea. These are all great ways of using the computer. Being on the for a while is not a waste of time. People can you their time wisly on the computer. Surprisingly it is true that all of the reasons are good for the time being on the computer. So you should try to make people be on the computer less often."	4	4		8

Have you ever had to write a paper and there wen't any books or encyclopedias available? Or have you ever just wanted to catch up with an old friend? @CAPS1 you answered yes to at least one of these questions, there is a good chance you have used a computer in your lifetime. Computers have positive effects because they can give you quick and reliable @CAPS2 and the can be fun too. To begin with let's go back to that example in the paragraph above. Have you ever been running late to a party and realize you do not have the direction's to the person's house? @CAPS1 you have, there are two things you can do in that situation. You can call up the person who probably wan't answer because they're @CAPS4 fun at their party, or you can go on the computer, type the person's address in and you will have your directions in seconds. Call me crazy, but this way seems quicker more efficient and reliable. My mother always says to me, ""@CAPS1 you're @CAPS4 trouble finding @CAPS2, go on the computer,"" because she knows that there is all the @CAPS2 in books on the @CAPS3, and more. And it's just one click away, @CAPS4 sold that, the computer has positive effects on you because it gives you quick and reliable @CAPS2 In addition, computers have positive effects on you when you're trying to have fun. For example, @CAPS5. @CAPS5 is used by teens and adults like, and for one reason only, to socialize with friends via computer. @CAPS1 you to another date and wait to see what your last friend's up the best thing to do would be to go on @CAPS5 and ask A @ORGANIZATION1 shows that in a family of five, four of them use the @CAPS3 to communicate and socialize with friends. Obviously, this is how computers have a positive effect. In conclusion, whether you're bored at home and it's a rainy day, or @CAPS1 you have to nght a research paper you saved until the last minute, a computer will be there for you. Positive effects computers have - are that they are quick and reliable, and they are fun to use."	5	4		9																					
108	1	"I saw in one of the news papers I got in the mail that had an overnight for people to state their opinion on kids computer useage. I took the idea of waiting this letter. Multiple people do have to use computers for multiple things. Such as: homework assignments such as essays, sometimes peoples family members go off to was but can't use cell phones, also online job alpications. To start off with, kids have homework assignment right? Most of the time people have to do essays. I ask my mom lots of times if I can do an essay for school, she say, ""why don't you stay after to do it?"" @CAPS1 have lives so they can't stay after, also at school the computers don't let you go on most websites unlike at home which does. That's mostly one main reasons kids use computers alot. Next,, some family members go off to war. Normally for safly and privacy, they wont let the soldiers life their cellphones, but for other reasons they can use their computers. Usually your family members know that you have a computer and want to contact you so that they to know their ok so they don't have to for two years. So, the base they ace at you can talk to them over video mail. I have an @CAPS2 that went to @ORGANIZATION1 and is now in @LOCATION2, and we sometimes talk to him over chat when he was in @LOCATION1. Lastly, job aplications. Most of the time people are home bound but need a job. Tons of @CAPS3 commertials show avertisements for jobs online. This is good for all types for people, homebound, elderly, ect. But mostly its good because they sometimes let you have your own business and you get good pay still. In conclution, Some people don't go online just to be online they actually are doing something such as talking to their loved ones that they wont see for along period of time, also school assignments. Plus, if people don't know people very well how do they know if they're active or not kids, and adults, should still be able to use computers when ever they want."	4	4		8																					
109	1	"Dear editor, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, and I believe that computers are a benefit to the world, and people as well. I say this because lots of people can talk to family of friends long distance. Also the computer can teach you lots of thing. Finally it makes you more social. In @CAPS1 strong opinion computers are better for the world. Firstly, many people can talk long distance with family of friends. You have web cam and that allows you to chat and see the person. Also @CAPS2 is another site where you can talk to friends and then you can have a lot and put pictures of yourself and even videos, even though you can talk on the phone and do all this but on the phone it costs money for a plan. When you use a computer it is completely free. Secondly, the computer teaches you things that help you later on in life, and it let's you know things as well. The computer people made programs that can computers and more really cool. The programs teach you how to type, it is called type to learn or type for fun. Also they have programs that let you know how to read. It is great for kids because they need to know these things any ways. Finally, the computer makes you more social. This is because you have @CAPS2 and it let's you know things that happen in school or out of school. You can talk to people on @CAPS2 or email each other and have a conversation with them. You can also meet new people from other places and have a good relationship with them. You have friends with and know who they are and won't need to figure it out. So, this is why I believe that having a computer is a good idea, and good to have. You can talk to people long distance. The computer teaches you things for life. Finally it makes you more social with people. So in @CAPS1 strong opinion it is a good idea to have a computer."	4	4		8																					
112	1	"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 these days are telling kids to go outside instead of vegging out in front of a computer. Computers can but promote bad habits. I try not to use the computer unless I have too for school or to get homework. Please consider the negative effects which are exercising in apropprate content and less interaction with friends/family. Yes internets can be used to find diets and exercise plans but if you would just go to the gym to burn of those pounds everything would be just fine! Internet and computers are designed to suck in your brain, and attack you to all the websites and neat little things. It is more effective just to go to a local @ORGANIZATION2 or @ORGANIZATION1 to work out. I swim on a swim team for a @ORGANIZATION2. I love swimming better than going on the computer. It satisfies my personal needs of exercising. I lost @NUM1 pounds by just swimming for a month. I will run on the tred mill to help me burn of stress or anger. Gyms are way better than computers. I know most of us have seen something inapropprate on the computer. Yes computers give people jobs but there is no need to post pictures or messages that will hurt peoples feelings. I know the other day I saw a really mean comment that made me feel bad for the victim. I know youtube is trying to stop inappropriate content, so hurray for them. Once you give something to the internet it is lost forever. Yes computers have ways to keep in touch with friends but it is better to @CAPS3 or visit in person. Like my @CAPS2 always said,"" @CAPS3 more, it builds character!"" @CAPS4 ever I get the chance I @CAPS3 my best buddies instead of using the computer. Kids theses days can be mean with out try. You disconnect yourself from your family. Because computers attrack users, there are times where you don't pay attention to others around you. @PERCENT1 of kids donot do there home work because of computers. Thank you for your time. I think computers are bad and everyone would be happy with out them. They help the obesity level in the nation, let cyber bullying and inappronrate content flow around the internet and lastly block you out from the world. ( @CAPS5.S someday computers are going to take over the world and you will be sorry you didn't listen to me.)"	5	4		9																					
116	1	"I agree with the newspaper, people are spending too much time on the computer and not exercising. everyone knows computers addictive. but people need to get out more. but people making it more addicting by creating things such as never ending games and its distracting people from there life, family, work and exercise."	2	2		4																					
120	1	"Dear @CAPS1: The effects that computers have on me is that it teaches me hand-eye coordination. I learn stuff from the computer, and it is a fun thing to go on. But, I mean those are only my opinions. Well im gonna just go ahead and explain them to you. The good thing about computers is that it teaches you hand-eye coordination which helps you see better with your eyes. Also it helps you with your hands by making you learn how to catch stuff and how to react quickly with your hands. For example I was playing baseball and I couldn't catch very good and I was also learning how to use the computer and because I was able to type fast my hands reacted when I got grounders and pop fly's hit to me. So I was so happy that I lerned how to use the computer and type. But for sure the computer is the best because you can research stuff and you find out more important facts. Also you are learnen more when ever you research anything. I'll tell you one thing though, I like the computer so much because it helps me find out important details and facts about the person that I am doing my project on. Yes I know the computer is so fun because you can go on different websites such as myspace.com, youtube.com, and funnyjunk.com. I go on mspace to talk to my friends and to meet new people that's what I like about myspace I meet new people and make new friends. I go on youtube because I like to listen to music and I watch music videos on their also I watch skate board videos too cause I love to skate! But one thing for sure is that I go on funnyjunk.com to play games cause they have so much fun games that you can play. But my favorite game is @CAPS2 the hedgehog. In conclusion those are @NUM1 opinions and @NUM1 reasons to support the effects about computers. So I want you to think about some effects about computers and your opinions about computers and compare them to my opinions? But hey! That's up to you only if you want to."	4	4		8

127	1	"Computers can affect the way people are and how they interact. Why is there a need to spend your precious life sitting in front of a compute all day?When you can be getting exercise for example going to your local gym. Computers become a distraction to your social life, thats why you should use them for emergency's and spend more time with your wonderful family and friends. Lastly you can enjoy you surrounding and appreciate life and nature. Computers are meant for business not for people to sit around and to nonsense things. Exercise is very important it helps the human body grow and stay in fit. If your sitting in front of a computer all day your body is going to shut down and won't get the proper exercise. Sports can be just as enjoyable and helps build the human body and gives you the right amount of exercise that your body needs. Sports also build hand and eye coordination just like if your sitting on the couch using a computer. In conclusion exercising can give you all of the same utensils that computers give you but it also benefits citizens more. Family is a wonderful thing in life, but they don't live forever. That's why we should cherries every last moment we have with them. A complete citizens and drives them from family and friends. Computers can take away your social life and you never do go out and meet people and friends. To sum things up computers are a to citizens and cause them to drive out family and friends. Nature is exotic and beautiful and all of us should take care of it and appreciate what we have. Computers can become harmful to nature and destroy homes for animals, for example when you print something from your computer it prints if out on paper. This causes more trees to be knocked down and cut for paper. We should only use paper for emergency's and not splurge on it. We all want the world to be a better place so stop destroying it for our own benefits! In conclusion computers just in the and will cause chaos and destruction. Instead of using them we could be getting the right amount of exercise, and spending it with family, and lastly enjoying nature and our surroundings. I strongly consider that you take my ideas into consideration and hopefully agree with them. "	4	5		9																					
134	1	"Computers are the way of the future. I believe that computers benefit society. I believe this because computers enable you to talk to family and friends online. It also gives you thousands of websites to learn valuable information from. Lastly it teached hand-eye coordination. First computers alow you to socialize online. I know @CAPS1 I get home from school I can talk to virtually any friends online. People against computers say it takes away time from interacting with family, however, this is not true. I talk to all of my aunts via facebook and other social websites. Also @CAPS1 my parents are at work the are abile to message me over the computer with out having to go get a phone and call my house. My last reason for this is that it helps me and my friends get intouch easier lets say I'm having a friend come over, but he got sick. He woulden't have to go look up a number and call me, he could just send me a message of the internet. My second reason is that computers help with education. I know that @CAPS1 I'm stuck on a problem at home, I'll just go on the computer and look up the answer. Also, @CAPS1 I have to do projects, the computer is very helpful for me and many other kids, @CAPS1 doing a project, I can't getall of my information from one book so I go on the computer and look up information about the subject. This really improves students grades, because they had more resources and more information to choose from, instead of only the information in the book. My last reason is that using a computer can help with hand-eye coordination. On the computer there are many sites that have very interactive sites the you can really benefit from I know of one website that was able to help me with my fielding in baseball because it had interactive games that would actually help with things is real life, like fielding in baseball. I know there are other websites like this for many other sports like basketball and foot ball. So the computer actually helped with real life activities. To sum it all up I think computers can benefit society a lot. Like being able to communicate with your friends. Also being able to look up school work with. Lastly helping with hand-eye coordination."	5	5		10																					
141	1	"Dear @PERSON3 of the @LOCATION1, I strongly believe that computers effect us in a positive way. Computers are advancing and so are their uses, computers are great and they are not our thought process or went to run around outside and play sports. Computers help us find and talk to relatives and friends they allow us to learn different things about farien places. They also are great for research! First and foremost computers are effecting us positively expesally when it comes to finding and talking to family and friends. My mom was adopted and @NUM1 years ago she really wanted to find her birth family, one year later her birth father found her on this website where you can locate family, she found her family and I now have two more @CAPS1, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, and a cousin @PERSON4. I love them all very much. I would not have of been able to get to know them if it wasnt for the computer, speaking of communication, I was working like a dog on this big science prodject I had. we weren't able to do it in person and it @CAPS3 impossible for one person to three way four people. So we emailed our ideas and thoughts and were able to get the project done. ""@CAPS2 are never enough hours in the day!"" @CAPS3 something that @CAPS3 commonly said. Over @PERCENT1 of adults complain that @CAPS2 @CAPS3 never enough time in day. That @CAPS3 a statistic from @ORGANIZATION1. The computer allows you to multi task so you can be on your business call and email your mother so she know that you didn't forget her birthday. In addition, computers help us understand other countries and learn about their culture and how they are doing. @CAPS2 are many people who don't have tvs and they get their news from the internet. Also for projects, in @NUM2 grade I had to learn about @CAPS4, the country in @LOCATION2. it would take countless hours to find research in books, you will find a lot of stuff you dont need, but on the computer it @CAPS3 fast and easy. If you need to know something you can just type it in and, boom! You have it where as if you were usinf a book you would still be looking for what you need. Time @CAPS3 something that we can't afford to waste expessaly in this economy. Furthermore, computers are great for all kinds of research and directions. People who think that people spend too much time on the computer, and exersizing are not always right. I don't know about you, @PERSON3, but I am constantly looking up different exersizes to get a flat stomach. Most of my friends do it with me. I also look up directions, finding routs on maps are enfuriating and take for ever. Go on the computer the maps are always updated and you can get easy and fast directions! I don't know about you but I love things fast and easy. Going back to research, what about for solving crimes? Identifying people with finger prints fast so no one can get hurt. In conclusion computers effect us in possitive ways, more and are a great help to society, from locating people, to communication, and all the way to finding valuable and life changing information. I hope that you and I see eye to eye in this matter, advancing computers are our friends not the enemy."	5	5		10																					
159	1	"Imagine standing outside, the warm sun dancing on your back, jumping into the pool and feeling the cool water flow around you. But no, that won't happen. Because children and their parents are spending way to much time on their computers. People aren't getting enough excercise, it can be very dangerous and families are spending less time with each other without computers, so its worse with them. I think people need to realize that computers are over the humans. Humans especially children, need exercise. But with computers that isn't really possible. More and more children are becoming obese by the year. Computers are making that happen quicker. Instead of sitting at the computer eating potato chips, children should be outside on their bikes, or swimming, or playing sports with their friends. If it is winter, the least kids could do is go sledding. Children need to expirience nature, not the screen of a computer. The computer can also be very dangerous. @NUM1 year olds are making facebooks! You can find @NUM2 year old on the internet now. Naive teenagers go find ""friends"" in chatrooms or on @CAPS2, and their ""friends"" lie to them, about their age, another indentity. Many teenagers go and meet someone they met online and end up getting raped or killed. There are many sick people in the world, and many of them use the internet to find people. Lots of teenagers give out personal information like their last name, cellphone number, or where they live, and thats an easy way for predators to find them. It puts them, and their whole family in danger. Computers are breaking up families, and friends. Things like @CAPS1, @CAPS2,@CAPS3, farmpring, @CAPS4, etc. are turning people against each other. Some families even eat dinner at the computer. When friends go over other friend's houses, they just sit on the computer. Why is it so fun to just look at the computer screen? Families need to do something together like eat dinner together, go out for ice cream, go shopping, something, anything but going on the computer all day. I'll admit, I am a little addicted to the computer. But I don't go on it @NUM3, like some people. Instead of eating dinner at the computer, go out to dinner as a family. Instead of online shopping, go shopping with your friends. It isn't hard to at back @NUM4 or @NUM5 hours of going on the computer. Am I the only teenager who thinks this? Maybe. But I know that I am benefitting myself by cutting back on the computer. We don't get enough exercise, it can become really dangerous, and family and friends should start spending more time together. Computers can do everything more than humans can, and we need to stop it."	5	5		10

People how can go on to their computers to communicate with peers, get information on any topic for a school paper, or just because the internet to watch videos and stories. Magazine and newspaper articles, books and even movies and shows sre available on today's computer! This advancement in technology has made the @NUM1 century the most modern era this world has ever seen, and is beneficial to society. The ""computer age"" has given people in today's society the incredible opportunity to broaden their imaginations through technology. You can, in less than one minute go on the internet type in to @ORGANIZATION1 whatever movie or book you want and start watching instantly. People have always said that books can take you anywhere you want. Well, the computers can do the same thing, expect with greater efficiency and with more places to choosen from. You can, instead of buying a book, go online and read of the faraway city of @LOCATION1, or of the eruption of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and you can do it with mind-blowing speed. Some think that by wasting time on computers, people are using up time that could be spent studying or with family. Howeer, any information needed to your knowledge on a topic can be found on the internet. And if you want to spent time with your family, you can even look your computer up to a tv and watch a free movie with the family! The computer age is here and it is exactly. What society needs. Picture this: you're doing a school project on the you know nothing about it. Would you rather drive minutes going and thirty minutes looking withb everything you need, or do you think it's more to spend five minutes looking for the website you need on the internet? Obviously, the later of the is much more reasonable. The computer makes getting research for school or work substantially easier. In addition,you can create entire presentations on a computers with surprising ease! Being an eighth grade student, I dont know I would ever do woithout the internet. I rely on my computer to get all of my research for almost every project, and I even make some of my best project on it! The computer is the likes of all the hard working students and adults much, much easier. People's lives have not only been made easier in the field of research; computer make communicating with friends and familyeasier as well! Through e-mail, video chat and instant messaging., we can communicate with whoever we would, whenever we wort. With some computers, you can even see and talk to any person you wish. Without these computers, we will one again have to resort to snail mail, whcih makes instant communication @CAPS3 telephones, we would have no other way to talk. Computers have enhanced communication chill likes so graetly that it's foolish to say their not beneficial to society.

168	1	"Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper: @CAPS1 you really think computers are that good? Computers are so helpful today almost everyone has one. Computers are wonderful they are great ways to find information, they connect people from all over the world, and offer many @ORGANIZATION1 opportunities, hopefully at the end of this letter you will agree with me. Firstly, they help people find information. Computers are great ways to find information with google and other programs like it the whole world is at your fingertips. In my school surveys show @PERCENT1 of all students use the computer to help them research for school projects and asignments with computers you can view many diffrent websites from all around the world about a topic and you can even find online books that you can use, this is one way computers are a great thing out there are two other great reasons. Secondly, with computers the wole world becomes smaller as people begin to know more and more people through the computer. More than @PERCENT2 of people email, @CAPS2, or videochat on a daily baes. Isnt it great when you mnake a great friend in collage but you find out he/she lives halfway around the world, to know that you can still keep in touch with the computer, did you know that many people in the in the military use videochat to keep in touch with their loved one back home? Computers are great because they connect people and allow them to be together even when they cannot be together, but there is still one even better reason why computers are good. Finally, computers ofter many opportunities like education and jobs. Today there are many single parrents more than in any other time according to @ORGANIZATION1 and the number is still drastickly increasing with this economy some of those parrents could really use a better education to help them bring in more money for their familys, but when can they find time to go to school with work and then the kids? Now there are many online collage courses you can take to get the education you have always wanted with kraigslist and other online adds many people can post job ofering while others can email those people their resume to try to get the job, but by seeing adds posted online people can apply easier from farther away. Computers open many great oppertunities for people. Computers are very cool machines that many people take fergranted, they help give people information, as well as connect people from around the world and offer many @ORGANIZATION1 oppertunities. So @LOCATION1 Newspaper I hope you can try to understand my view on why computers are so great."	5	4		9																					
170	1	"There are some effects computers have on people that I agree with and disagree with. There are many people in the world that use computers every day and some that use it sometimes. Also it always gives you information everytime you use it. I would think that computers give a positive effect on people. Computers can have their likes and dislikes. Not everytime when you need information the computer won't give it to you. There are some websites that give you the right stuff you want to know and others do not fill your mind with positive things. That is one thing I do not like about computers. Do not think that is too bad because computers have alot more fun adavantages. One of the most common and used thing around the world is instant @CAPS7. Instant @CAPS7 is when you are communicating with another human bean over the online web. Many people use this to get in touch with a close family members or a friend. There are some names for instant @CAPS7 @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4-mail, and many more! Yes, the computer can be very addicting but once in a while you need to get off and maybe get some fresh air. For some people I agree that they stay on the computer to much and became very lazy. This is one disadvantage that can cause you from exercizing and seeing friends and family. There is no problem if you go on for an hour a day maybe more, but to long is not good. There are so many things for the computer I can't name them all @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS7, and even buying things off the computers, those are many of the things you can do on your computer. I love going on the computer time to time doing many things I have talked about. Also if you do have one than reading this @MONTH1 persuade you into getting one. My opinion is that they give you a very positive effect."	4	4		8																					
178	1	"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 play a big role in our world today. For example people use computers to get imformation, talk in chat rooms, mainly to talk to friends and fined friends. I think this @CAPS6 messing people up. My first reson for thinking computers @CAPS6 messing people up @CAPS6 because of the impformation that @CAPS6 on the website. For example people past, and blog lies about people online. This @CAPS6 ruining many people because this starts rumors and gossip about people. Also the lies that are being posted could interfear with many lives. Another reason computers effect the lives and people @CAPS6 the dangerous chat rooms. This @CAPS6 not good because your not familliar with the person your talking too. The person could have posed as another person and be very hipocritical. The result of this could be very unpleasent. Like you might give them you number, adress, @CAPS2 personal imformation. The outcome to endup in death, kidnapping, @CAPS2 ciber bullying. Lastly, I want to talk about the false imformation that @CAPS6 given to thousands of people online. Another words the""@CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Your @CAPS4 love"" @CAPS2""@CAPS6 Your @CAPS7 @CAPS8 On You?"" @CAPS9 these things are placed on either side of your screen to get money from you. On the other hand they attract the readers attention. For example these passages are set to copy down your number, get your account number then take your money. This doesnt help our peole because its only there for your money. In conclusion from my veiwible stand piont I dont prefer computers a magnificient way for people to spend there time on."	4	4		8																					
182	1	"Dear local newspaper, I think more people shouldn't spent time on their computer. The reasons why I think this is because people should spend time with their family and friends, second they need to exercis more, and last go outside enjoy nature. My first reason is that people that have computers stay in their rooms all day and don't get fresh air. They need to go out and enjoy nature. People who love animals and like to study animals should go out and get fresh air watch the animals study them. Haveing a computer is you could study animals like that is ok but you dont want to got stuck on the computers. go outside and watch them instead of looking at the computer screen. My second reason is that people do get more exercis. People are getting fat because they are sitting at the computer and not doing any movement. Peple are becoming lazy every day because they are on the computers @NUM1. Is you like to be on the computer and study go for a walk, run, joy, or ride a bike to the get some so a while. My last reason is that more people need to interact with their friends and family. People should get off the computer and make some plans with their family.Have a get together with your family and go places and chill. People who be on the computers don't spend time with there family dont know whats going on around them. Some people go into depresion because they are on the computers not enough time with family. These ar my reason why i think that we shouldn't be on the computers. We should spend more time with friends family or go outside, and enjoy nature."	4	4		8																					
187	1	"Dear,newspaper I think that people should have computers I think that because kids play game to help them learn like math game or read and grown ups can go on websites and watch work out videos and they could pay there bills on the computer to and they dont have it in the store of kids need to do there homework computers are good for that buy thet also have bad stuff like kids say they are doing there homework but they are on youtube myspace or facebook. or other stuff but computers have more good stuff about them they bad things so that? Why I think we should have computers."	3	2		5																					
191	1	"Dear The @CAPS1, I understand that you have some concerns about computers. I don't think you should be concerned though. You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy. In conclusion I think computers are a great, fun, and helpful invention. Remember these good characteristics that computers have and please don't take computers away; we need them."	4	4		8																					
195	1	"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 idea about ""Computers"" is very well thought outside of the box.Well. We sure need computer to look up information these days. Why do we need them now and it dident existed before? Reseach shows over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 says computer is everything. Let me explain a little bit further to you what I mean. First, you can look up places, chat with friends and family. @CAPS1 oppinion about using the local internet would be that it's good only for those who knows and not trying to be mean. For little world neve should get to bed at least @NUM1 pm, and never to forget about nature outside of fresh air. In conclusion, internet these days are very good for people."	2	3		5																					
202	1	"I completely agree with those people who think computers have a negative effect on us today. Even though computers are great they do have many negative effects on people who use them. Since. new technology, and post pictures on websites where everyone can see. Also they have games for computers that people get hooked on. Lastly, there are predator online. The new technology is amazing, like webcams where you can video chat or cellphones where you could take pictures, @CAPS1 they do have negative effects. There have been many suicides over cyber bullying. This is where people bully kids over the internet. Also some people send naked pictures online or even while webcamming. this is illegal and absurd that young or even older people would be doing these actions. Also there are websites where people can post these pictures of you that are very personal and make a huge difference in you life. There are many people who have games for their computer or download games off of websites. Most people actually get addicted to the game, They would play it all day if they could and if they arent playing they are wishing they could. This makes them miss out on alot of things. They might not get enough excersise or not do any homework which will make you grades drop. They could also not be spending time with family. It also might change who you are as a person. The most important thing about the use of computers is your safety. There are predator all over the internet and can pretend they are someone from school and ask where you live. You should never tell anyone where you live or your full name online. They can and most likely will come to your house for you. It could most likely cost you or even family members your lives. Computers can be fun and you can learn an abundant amount of information but as long as you smart about using it. Remember not to tell anyone where you live or dont take pictures and send them that are personal. They could be all over the internet the next day. Lastly, worry about your family, grades, and health than some useless game. Be smart and safe!"	4	4		8																					
203	1	"Dear Newspaper, I think people need computers. It helps them see the world if they can't. It can be used to send important messages to people that are farther away from you. Also if someone has a parent or loved one far away they can see each other through the computer. So here is examples of these three things. Some people can't physically or mentally and can't afford to travel. Its sad how some people are so sick with a disease or illness that they can't go places. But if they go on the internet they can look up pictures and information of places they've never been to which can help them see the world better. But there are people who can help them see the world better. But there are people who have fears which prevent them from travelling to different places. So thet could go to the internet and find ways to help them get over their fears. Which in turn will allow them to get over their fears and let them travel to places. Then there are people who can't afford it. So the internet can help find a good job that pays good money which they can use to afford to travel the world and see it for what it is. What if you need to send a really important message to someone to prevent them doing something or help them live or even stop a war. So take into reconsideration if there is a war going on for a miss understanding. So if the government figures out what happened and they know how to straightin out the situation then they could send a message to the attackers. What happened and that it wasn't what they thought we did then they would stop fighting and the war would be over. What if a bomb is in the white house you would want to get out of the building or find it and disarm it. So then a guy finds out about it and send a message to the white house and that would save all the people in the white houses lives. Sometimes loved ones go away to some where far away and you can't talk or see them. Someones in the military and he/she has a kid so the computer allows them to see and talk to them through a webcam which would keep the child and parent together and not seperate them. Also you see a friend in facebook who you haven't seen in years so you friend him and you guys get back in touch with each other and you can be friends with them again. So in conclusion the computer can do many helpful things. It can fix relationships, save lives, help you get over fears and see the world. Which isn't bad sure we sometimes go over board with it but it is very useful. It isn't horrible but it is sometimes bad but also sometimes good but"	5	5		10																					
209	1	"Dear local newspaper editor, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects of computers on people is that staying on a computer is not that bad it does not rot you brain like video games. are some good reasons why computers are good and help you. Sometimes computers do help with hand-eye coordination. You use the computer to do homework or to search a a stores etc. Some computers are really slow but not all of the new ones for @DATE1, computers can also help you read better it has little . You could play talk to people like your friends. Listening to music is an easy thing to you could a website that has all songs that you like to listen yo many people use the computer to find jobs and use it to look for ways to eat right and work out paying bills online is easyer than paying them for real. The computer is easy way to pay and you should agree with @CAPS1 opinion."	3	3		6																					
224	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, Computers have great effects that are positive towards people. This is @CAPS3 it teaches hand eye cordanation, allows people to learn about far away places, and to talk to other people online. Computers have great positive effects for everyone. Computers teach hand eye cordanation. When a person is typing they are using their hands to type while looking at the monitor for the letters. Computer games help to teach this @CAPS3 in the game things happen very quickly so the person has to ee whats going on and click the correct key fast thus improving hand eye @CAPS1 greatly. Studys do show that people who use computers have a @PERCENT1 better hand eye @CAPS1 then some one who dosen't. Coumputers help hand eye @CAPS1 and they can teach you about far away places. Someone can learn about far away places by searching it up online. They will get many facts about that place. Sheral from @LOCATION4 said "I heard some one at school mention @LOCATION2 and didn't know a thing about it so I searched it and got a ton of facts." This shows the computer can help someone learn about foiren countrys and they can talk to people far away. Using the computer soemone could talk to you while your hundreds or thousands of miles away. Tehy can do this through e-mail of video chat. a @CAPS2 showed that seven out of ten people prefer video chat @CAPS3 its faster and the two people can see each other. However either way they are still fast ways to contact a person far away. Jack from @LOCATION1 said "@CAPS3 of video chat I was able to talk to and see my cousin from @LOCATION3 who I almost never see. This gos to show that the computer is a positive thing for people. The computer is helpful in so many ways it teaches hand eye cordniation, it allows people to learn about far away places and it allows for people to talk to other people. Computers are a great thing for everyone."	4	4		8																					
232	1	"Lately, a technology buzz has hit all over the world. Where ever you look, be it at home, at school, at work, or on the streets, you see people texting, talking on phones, blogging, and other computer related things. This concerns some people. They believe that these generations are relying too much on computers and not spending enough time exercising outside or socializing. But here is where they go wrong. These experts are judging computers too harshly, for it's not like everyone is zoning out in front of a glass screen, sucked into the world beyond. @CAPS9, most of these ""computer geeks"" are using the computer for useful things, while they are also used for entertainment, computers also help society to reconnect with long-lost friends or even get directions to a well-know resuraunt. As you can plainly see, computers are not turning us all into zombies. Computers are sometimes seen as a nusence. Parents complain about the many times they have to drag their sons and daughters from the screen for dinner or a soccer game that started @NUM1 minutes ago. But you see, this doesn't mean its bad. Everyone goes on the computer. ""Even though my father complains that I'm on @CAPS1 too much,"" @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1, says. ""@CAPS2 forgets that @CAPS2 has one of his own."" This is an example not unlike many other student's parents. About @PERCENT1 of adults confess that they too have fallen into the new fads such as @CAPS1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. So why do we need these things? What seems to make them so important to us? The answer is simple, it makes us feel connected. Then again, if you think about it, maybe not so simple. Many people have different opinions on why the computer is so important to them, but most agree that friends is one big factor. ""Everyone is already online."" @PERSON2, computer technician, informs. ""@CAPS6 all your friends are in something, wouldn't you want to as well?"" @CAPS7, as the famous saying, @CAPS8 your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?, flashes through your mind let me answer that for you - @CAPS9. Being connected and diving off the deep ends are too different concepts. As you find friends from highschool or just friends from school, your glad that @CAPS7 you can talk to them face to face - or computer screen to computer screen - again. Last, but certainly not least, the computer is a great resource. While some people complain, others are using what it has to offer by looking up directions to events or facts for your next report. This is how websites like @ORGANIZATION2 make billions from the words being typed into the search engine. The facts and places that arise from the computr are like gems waiting to be found. In conclusion, its easy to see why the computer and its resources are so loved. Everyone uses it for different things and different hobbies. Whilesome for pure entertainment, others for information, and another for reconnection. My personal favorite finiding the true treasure of hidden bands, the fantastic ones, that @CAPS9 one even knows. And so, this is why I'm convinced the computer is a positive impact on the world."	6	6		12																					
242	1	"Dear Newspaper, In our town, more people are on the computer each day. Some people state that you can do a lot on the computer and talk to people. But, I believe that our town should not support advances in technology. You will have more time to exercise, talk to family and friends in person and to take part in different activities around the town. Do you want to be overweight and not be in shape? Well, if you sit at the computer all day every day, you will become like that. ""I think exercise shoud be a part of everybody's day,"" @CAPS1 teacher @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 stated. You would be so attatched to your computer, that you wouldn't work out. In the state of @LOCATION1, it is proven that @PERCENT1 of residents are overweight from not exercising and @PERCENT2 are overweight by not eating properly. This shows more people in @LOCATION1 don't exercise than not eating properly. @CAPS4 wants to be overweight and you can change that! More people each year make facebook and @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Some kids in school are on the internet all day talking to friends who live down the street. Students refuse to talk to their friend on the phone. Instead, they do it online. ""@CAPS4 can understand their tone of the message sent,"" @PERSON3 stated. You could interpret it in different ways. When you are on the phone, it is a quick and easy way to communicate not waiting for somebody to type back. If you are a person who is always on the computer, plan a get together with your friend to talk in real life. Sidewalk sales, clubs, sports teams, holiday stroll, these are events that every town offers! Instead of sitting dreaming of being on the team, go out and do it! Each town cares about its residents and want them to have fun. That is why towns offer these activities. ""@CAPS5 want to make the town interasting and everybody to know each other,"" says @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @PERSON2. If you participate in these activities, you will meet other kids your age around the town. If your town offers all of these activities, they are helping you out. Being out helping the town is way better than sitting in your house on the computer! In many ways both advancing technology or not, why be inside doing nothing but talking to people? Go and talk to them in real life. Being in shape, talking to people in real life and activities your town offers is the way to go. Thank you for your concern"	4	5		9																					
249	1	"According to @PERSON1, economic @CAPS1, every hour you spend on the computer, you raise your electricity bill by @MONEY2. The average @CAPS2 spends @NUM1 hours on the computer everyday. I believe that spending too much time on the computer could be a bad thing. You have economic loss from the electric bill, health loss because you won't be able to exercise as much, and community less because you won't spen as much with your community. Financial loss is something that many people are concerned about. If everybody spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, they could save @MONEY1 off their electric bill. In a survey, @NUM3 out @MONEY1 @NUM4 people said they would do anything to save money. So if they spent less time on the computer they would save lots @MONEY1 money. In addition to financial loss there is also a health issue. Many people are talking about how americans are becoming obise. Part @MONEY1 this is due to spending too much time on the computer. Proffesor @CAPS3 @MONEY1 @ORGANIZATION1 says that, ""the obisety in @LOCATION1 is a problem, if people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, that problem would be solved."" @CAPS4, @NUM5 out @MONEY1 @NUM6 people are obese. If everyone spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, it would become @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM6. Although health is a problem community is a bigger one. People never talk to eachother face to face anymore. They all talk on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6. Commmunities are spending less time together in real life than on the computer. @PERSON1, expert on human behavior, says that when people spend less time on the computer, ther spend more time together. It's a fact that when people spend more time together, they have more fun. So, I would say that spending less time on the computer would be beneficial to our community. It would provides financial, health, and community benefits. These are all important things that we lack if we spend too much time on the commputer."	5	4		9

Most families live all over the country @MONTH1 be even in another country, and you don't get to see them very often because of traveling prices, however with the computer they can help us keep in contact with them very easy and quicker than you can say ""@LOCATION1."" @CAPS1 more people make a website that allows us to easily keep up with our distant family. Facebook, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 of fish, and singles net are all sites that you can find friends or the one that's right for you. This gives you a chance to discover @CAPS1 people with the same interest as you. Half of my mom's boyfriends were from these sites. Without these sites there might be less divorces and more happy ending fairy tales. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people work out home. It's good and you can get things done the.

259	1	"As time goes on, our society becomes more advanced with more and more unnecessary technology, such as the television. What I really want to write about is the computer. Society today has developed a very unhealthy habit, and it is always using the computer. Everyone in the twenty first century uses a computer. The world got so used to having the computer around, that if all the computers in the world were to ""break,"" then most people probably would not know how to @CAPS2. Like the basic theory of. Which was that the world was ""@CAPS1"" to end back in the year two-thousand because everyone thought that the world was going to end. Only because the computer were going to crash and lose all the data that we have ever recorded. Humanity relies way to much on the computer. Since many people rely on the computer to @CAPS2, a lot of people ""forget"" to excersise! Our body needs excersise to live. Excersise one of the most important activities in our daily lives. When you don't excersise, and all you do is eat junk food and drink today, you better bet on your mothers grave that your going to either get diabetes, the fly, heartburn, or any other sickness or disability. You are what you eat is what I say. Life already has enough distractions in it, why add another distraction? All the computer is, is a distraction from keeping you and everyone else healthy. The computer started off as an ""innocent"" invention. Now a days, people literally worship the computer like it is a @CAPS3. People who use the computer all day every day, end becoming very lazy, because all they want to do is sit down and use the computer. In my opinion, everybody should be a part of some physical activity. Whether it is basketball, football, baseball, track, tennis or my favorite thing to do, skateboarding. Everyone should get physically active atleast three times a week for many reason, fact is, that if you excersise three times a week at the least, that your body will function better, you will look better, and you will feel better. excersise can be fun, as long as you make it fun. I hope this essay has really made you think about how you want to live. excersise should be a huge part of your daily routine, now sitting on your buttox all day searching pointless videos on ""youtube.""

265	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, computers. The subject of so many debates over the years, from lawyers against judges to parents against children. Could it be to much of a good thing? Are computers the cause of increased awkwardness in today's society. Certainly it can't be to good that your entire life is documented on a place where anyone can go. And then there is the content of what you are viewing. I can't wait to get to that paragraph. One of the top @NUM1 picked-through subjects in the world, are people really less interested in exercise than they were in the @NUM2's? studies show that in the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, @NUM3 out of @NUM1 people were overweight. That number has risen to @NUM5 out of @NUM1, as of @DATE1. Amazing! And some of these people might be safer staying inside. If you've played a video game where the player can lose health, you'll know what happens when the bar runs out. You restart. After playing @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @MONTH1 want to try that gravity-defying, head-turning stunt. And let me tell you, there is no restarting after that. Did you know that @ORGANIZATION1 is recording everything you do online? If say, you are a budding guitarist and are looking around for a new gibson, you'll start getting all these ads for online stores, @CAPS12? Because @ORGANIZATION1 sells your info to businesses. And you give them permission by clicking that continue with install button. So spam email comes. But something even worse is on the way. Your bank account number. Thats right, I went there. If a virus get onto your computers, your many could vanish. So be responsible. This brings us to our last subject. The touchy one. It used to be that you had to buy a magazine or book to witness the exploitation of young women. Now, it is just the click of a button away. And that is bad enough. Young boys are snagged early, their futures now controlled by this disease. But add to that the imense risk of a virus attack, and you're in a heap of trouble. So I'm not saying computers are terrible, just that they they could be to much of a good thing. Sometimes they can be a good way to relieve stress, by taking it out on a hapless alien. Just use the technology at your hands responsibly."	5	6		11																					
268	1	"Dear, @CAPS1 I would like to tell you something. Throughout the ages we have been evolving, from caveman discovering fire to discovering how to fly. With evoloution we discovered technology and in recent years we have been making new technologies rapidly. Some say that some technology like computers are bad, I think that computers are good because they give you the ability to learn about for away places. let you talk to people online and teach hand-eye coordination. Computers let you go places that you ordinarilly wouldn't be able to go to. If you were doing a research projects on @LOCATION1 and you didn't have any books what would you use? That's right, a computer the internet would have the facts you needed, so you could grade. While on the internet you could talk to friends and family who @MONTH1 live for away. The computer goes over long distances and connects both computers so you can bend writing almost instantly. Without computers you wouldn't be able to get in touch with these people. Using computers is good for the body as well as the mind. It helps you with your hand-eye coordination. When you see things on the screen and go to chick it you are actually helping out your body. Some people say that when you are on the computer you aren't interacting with friends and family, but they are wrong. I myself have talked with my sister in a different room while using the computer so the computer lets you interact with friends and family too! I love computers, don't you?"	4	4		8																					
269	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, yes, I do believe that for too many people are 'addicted' to the computer, and spread more than enough time on the computer everyday! Not only teenagers but the children and youth have fall into trap of the computer. As I grew up in my younger years I hated the computer all I wanted to do was go outside and play. As I became older I used the computer way more often than I did before I now believe the computer takes time away from family time to get the sitting down to read a good book and hanging out with friends. Insteed of all those fun interacting activities people decide to go on facebook, myspace, twitter, youtube, addicting games, and whatever else they could find. I do not agree with that being sluck to the computer like is to chese. No! If there was our thing in the world that would keep parents and children together, it isn't the computer. Computers distracts kids and teenagers from doing other things in life, also it doesn't follow families to be a family. Before computers were made all people bad was their family. Coming home from school saying ""@CAPS3 dad, home from school. What t go play see catch""? Instead of that kids come home from school to see if @CAPS4 replied to your facebook message. Computers also cutt off interacting time that families always and to have. @DATE1 @TIME1 instead of talking to @CAPS5 myspace, why don't you grab and plays family board game! Or go out to on restaurant, talk about your next vacation and what you'd be interseted doing go to the same field have a game, or to your local base ball field and play kickball, instead of sitting there mesmerized by the computer screen! Okay, I @MONTH1 understand that some people just @MONTH1 not like to go out and play or engage in physical exercise and that is totally understandable that is still no excuse for sitting at the computer and a book. Reading is yet fun but it is also , with out being in school! As you read your brain to inner works, you or your so you can show off to you friends out family on words that you .

271	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I've heard about your problems with computers, and would like to state my opinion. I think that computers teach you more than they, disable you. For example , say you have a research project and you need to look someone up, you go on the computer and you got him. Also, say you want to go far for vacation; like @LOCATION1. You can go on the internet and find out how they live there. My last reason is that now you can be on the computer and still interact with family and friends. First, I stated the first one because a couple of weeks ago I had a social studies research project. But ig I couldn't use a computer then I would of had to use a book; instead of going on the computer and just looking it up. Another exsample could be like you need pictures to make the project look better . So you can go on google and find a picture to go with you project. But thats not all the internet can help you with. Like say you been planning a trip to @LOCATION1 for your honeymoon but never been there or know anything about it, but your honeymoon is a month away. You can go on the computer and learn about it. Also now they have online classes and you can learn their language before you go. But to wrap it up I have on more exsample. Lastly, chatting sosme people think because you on the computer all day you can't interact with others, but you can. for exsample, like they have a website called @ORGANIZATION1. You can chat with all your friends at once. Also they have video chatting, so you can be looking right at the person while your talking, all that's all I can think of. I hope that my lette and probably many others show you about computers actually do."	4	4		8																					
276	1	"Dear local Newspaper, I believe that computers are bad news. Most kids come home from school and go on aim. So they can talk to their friends. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 are obiese. I feel it is better to play outside with your friends than sitting in a chair playing on the computer. If kids go outside and play with their friends they will have more fun. Also kids will learn how to interact with each other by playing outside together. The kids will see more nature and be bale to learn more about animals. When kids are on computers they are sitting their doing nothing. ALso some kids post pictures of themselves on things like facebook that are not appropriate and cna get them in lots of trouble. They also say things that they wouldn't normally say to a persons face. The computer is simply a way for kids to get in trouble. Whne your outside palying baseball, football or tag with your friends you are getting exercise and your having lots of fun. If you are getting lots of exercise then you are most likely not going to be obies. Some say the computer is good hand eye coordination but catching a football or hitting is bettre. Also some say computers can tell you about far away places but that what school is for. I am saying that exercise and playing with your friends is better than talking in your friends or video chatting with them, @CAPS2 are to many over weight people in @LOCATION1 and the computer is not heloing the cause. "	4	4		8																					
282	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I heard that you wanted some opinions on whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. I know that a lot of people are against these positive opinions but I think computers have a positive effect on people. The main thing that computers are great for is research. Without computers, kids an adults won't be provided with the necissary tools for knowledge. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students have computers at home and that @NUM3 person without computer access gets about @PERCENT1 of a lower grade because of poor research ability on projects. Another reason why computers are good because it can bring the world together. Facbook, @CAPS2, and twitter users can chat with people accross the street, accross the country and even accross the ocean! People in the @LOCATION5 can play games and chat with people in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2 and even @LOCATION3! My last reason is that computers are great for buiesnessess. A lot of people have websites for their jobs that can get them well known and for people to know what their buisness is about. Take for example your newspaper. Without computers, you wouldn't be able to get your research or even type or print your newspaper. Your website wouldn't be able to persuade people to read your newspaper. Even though some people might abuse their computer privlages by staying on too long instead of exercising or interacting withpeople but thats them. It's only @PERCENT2 of people with computers that do it! And so what, its their time and they want to spend it on the computer. What can you do to change? Nothing. And with that, I conclude this letter by letting you know that computers are great for people! They give us research, they help us with school and buiesnessess and they allow us to talk to people around the world."	4	4		8																					
283	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing a letter to you saying that I think its a bad idea for you to make kids stay off of computers because it does teach kids something, it good to do homework on and you can relax when your on it. Well computers teaches kids a lof of things like hand-eye coordination. If kids want to work with computers when there older they can learn new to work with it. There is also websites that can show you how to move yor hands when using a computer. Well when kids come from school always have homework, @CAPS2 you need to do it on the comptuer so if you couldn't use computers it would be hard for kids to do there homework. So when they go to school and the class tells the teacher they dont have computers what are they going to do. So when I get out of school and I had a very long day. I go home do my homework and go on the computer and listen to music to relax. If you guy were to take computers away every one would be grumpy all the time. That is why I think you should keep computers and not exercise as much. We get enuf of that in school carry all these heveay books around."	3	3		6																					
284	1	"Dear @STATE1 news, Computers are a great machine to use. People can research, learn about any topic or subject and let people talk to friends online I think that computers have a good effect on people. Computers are one of the great inventions we have. They are very helpul in our everyday life. When people need to write a paper for school or do a project you can research what you need if you need to know some thing about, a topic that you don't know about, you can look up questions you have about it on the internet. If your writing a paper and need an answer its all on the internet. Suppose you want to go on a family vacation to california you can plan your whole trip right on your computer, you can book a flight, get a hotel room and even see what there is to do you can see the whole world right from your computer. If you want to learn another language you can learn an entire language on your computer. Also if your to busy to go to collage or want to take another class there are even schools online. The computer is a great way to learn about new things. Finally you can talk to friends online websites like facebook and myspace are great ways to keep in touch with your friends. naother positive way is @CAPS1 you can instant message friends and family without having to wait so long for a response back. If you want your friends you can just message them. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. They are helpul in many ways such as people can do research, learn about new things and talk to friends I hope, you see my point at view they are samething everyone should have."	4	4		8																					
286	1	"Dear computer co., computers have a negative effect. Why would you go outside if you could play life - like games on your @CAPS1? I lthink that the games on th @CAPS1 should be removed so people could enjoy all of the great things in life. If people weren't on @CAPS1's all day, people would pay attention to the way they're destroying nature."	2	2		4																					
293	1	"Dear Newspaper people, @CAPS1 opinion's on what effect's do computer's have on people is without the computer we couldn't research important people and event's. Also we couldn't type important paper's. Last we can talk to other people. Now that @CAPS1 first opinion is without the computer we couldn't research important people and events. This is one of @CAPS1 reason's because if people didn't know anything about an important person they could look them up. For an example who is harry @PERSON1. He was the @NUM1 president. I didn't know who he was or what he did until I looked him up on the internet. @CAPS1 second opinion is we wouldn't be able to type important paper's. I say this because people that have @CAPS3's mostly have to type paper's. And without the computers everything would have to be hand-writen. Also some people have bad hand writing. @CAPS1 last opinion is we can type to people that are online and offline. I say this because if you have to tell a family member, or a friend something important but, you phone is dead or broken you can e-mail them. Or if you have a facebook you can tell them on that. Last you can I.M them. Now that you know three opinion's on what effects computer's have, people can alway's excrise around there house or around there block."	4	4		8																					
298	1	"Dear Newspaper, I think computer use is good because, it will teach people to have hand-eye coordination. Also people will have the ability to learn about different states and countries. I ask people would be able to interact with their family and friends from different towns. Those are all the reasons why I think computers are a good use. The first reason why I think people should use computers is it will teach people to have hand-eye coordination. People will know how to stay focussed with their eyes and also know how to also use their hands all at the same time. To stay focussed with their eyes people would have to wear glasses for the light. Also so when they are typing they wont have to keep looking down all the time. When people coordinate with their hands on the computer its so they know were the different are thats why computers are good. My second reason why computers are good is because people will have the ability to learn about the different states and countries. They can also see how nice or bad the countries and states look. Also they will be able to read about what different cultures they have and religions. In the states also be to read about @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and how we have a wonderful state. That's why computers are good use. My final reason why the use of computers is good because, people can interact with their family and friends online. There are a lot of different websites you can go to that you can search for one of your family members or friends. You can talk to each other. Also you can talk to them even if their in a different state. You guys can talk about a lot of different things. For example, the family and life and even if you miss them. Thats why computers are good. Those are my reasons why computers are good. Not only can it teach you about hand-eye coordination, family and friends, and about different states. But also you can play a lot of different games and also type on an notepad. Also if your stuck on a math problem you can use the calculator. That's why people should use the computers."	4	4		8																					
302	1	"Dear @CAPS1 times, @CAPS2 you think computers benefit society? Well I think so! There are countless reasons why computers are both resourceful and helpful. Many citizens in our own community of watertown think computers are a great resource for many things while others disagree with this completely. Computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet, also you can interact with your friends and family, and lastly there are many applications used for business. On both a computer and the internet there are more than @NUM1 million things you can learn. When you are struggling with homework a computer is a great resource. You can quickly open @CAPS3.com and search any topic at any time. For example, if you did not know a conversion it is easily found on the internet. Another thing you can be taught or informed about is news. There are websites such as nytimes.com and cnn.com that give you daily news. I personally use these websites weekly. On the computer you can find vacation sports you want to learn about and go to. When my family was planning our trip to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 we used the computer constantly. In the end, computers can teach you many things. Secondly you can interact with people on the internet in many ways. These include social networking websites, webchat and email. Social networking websites are a great way to connect to family members and friends from the past. Websites that were created for this include: facebook, myspace, and twitter. These free websites let you add friends, send messages, and post pictures. Web chatting is a way to video people. You can personally see someone from acroos the @ORGANIZATION1 from your webcam. Lastly, emailing is a great way to inform people. You can write a visual letter to one of your friends. In conclusion, the computer is one excellent way to interact. Lastly, the computer is used for business. An application called microsoft office is used in countless bussinesses, microsoft office word, powerpoint, excel and @CAPS4. Each of these are used to plan, sell, present, manage, and write about products. Microsoft is something you should download in the near future. Business also use webchatting, as I previously state, for conference calls. A production company can be face to face with a company from china without being in the room with them. This makes it much easier than to fly half way across the @ORGANIZATION1. Finally, computers are used when manufacturing a product in or at a business. Work sites such as @CAPS5 companies use computers to control their machines. I know that the @ORGANIZATION2 factory uses computers in their factory due to the fact that I watche the show unwrapped about them on @CAPS5 @CAPS6. In the end computers are a necessary item in a business. In conslusion, computers have a great affect on people. The can teach people many new and exciting things they did not know. Also, connect humans with each from half way across the @ORGANIZATION1. Lastly, businesses would not run well without a computer. Computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet. Also you can interact with your friends and family, and there are many applications used for business. If I were an expert I would have nothing to worry about concerning computers. They are a magnificent thing. @CAPS2 you have the same belief and understanding as me?"	5	5		10																					
303	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The use of computers does not benefit our society. Instead of spending time with the people we love, like friends and family, our time is knawed up by the one electronical device that many people depend on; the computer. This is not a very good thing to have an electronic device like this in our ever day lives because it uses a lot of electricity, it is expensive to buy and replace, and it allows hackers or other bad people into things we dont want them to see. But using electricity is @CAPS4 the start. By using electricity for this nonsense device, we waste money. We also are doing our part to destroy the environment. Greenhouse gasses and fuel are poisoning the air and being wasted. ""I don't have a computer at my house, and I get along pretty well."" @CAPS3 a local environmentalist. So that's @CAPS4 it; we can get along well without the computers taking over our lives. Along with not being good for the environment, it is also not good for the economy. My dad always @CAPS3 how he doesn't like to waste money, and then he goes and purchase a computer. Not only has this computer crashed once, but twice! A waste of money has been put into buying it, restoring it once, and now restoring it a second time! Plus computers waste our time. I always remember my grandfather saying "",I don't know why you folks waste all your precious time and money on these doo-dads!"" With so many people aquiring new devices, fewer people will be able to keep track of what goes where and who sees it. This is a terribele thing for the people, but a very, very good thing for the bad people. By ""bad people"" I mean internet hackers. As time goes on, and people get less aware of what's happening in their electronic lives, more and more hackers will be able to get what they want; in fact, anything they want. ""@CAPS4 a few months ago, I put a message on the message board on the @CAPS5 website which said I would be on vacation for a week. My address was also posted, because that message was a mobile upload. When I came back from vacation, half the things in my house were gone!"" said a local resident. Burglaries, robberies, and internet access can lead to chaos. Feeble protection is never good. But remember, computers are using massive amounts of electricity, amking many people waste time and money, and allowing bad people into things we don't want them to see. Please understand the meaning how terrible computers are."	5	5		10																					
304	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion @CAPS3 as to why some people support advances in technology belive that computers have a positive effect on people is that I disagree. Some people dont even get enough sleep if they stay up too late on computers. Also they spend less time exersizing and less time interacting with family and friends. Thos are @CAPS1 reasons as to why I disagree. In this paragraph I am going to tell you about why I think that people should @CAPS4 other things than going on the computer all night. If they wake up in the morning and start being grumpy dont blame them the computer had them stay up late. Would you rather get a good nights rest or be extra tired in the morning because you stayed up too late on the computer? Well once I stayed at @CAPS1 friends house and she was up on the computer all night she didnt even get any sleep. In the morning she was soo grumpy because she was soo tired. @CAPS1 languege arts teacher ""@PERSON1"" says that ""@CAPS2 up late on the computer all night isnt healthy because you get bugs under your eyes and youre sleepy. I mean theres a whole lot of side effects."" @NUM1 out of @PERCENT1 of parents agree with me and @CAPS1 first reason. In this paragraph I am telling you @CAPS1 second reason as @CAPS3 why I disagree which is less time excersizing. (@CAPS3 the parents) @CAPS4 you realy want your kids to be lazy and on the computer all days or @CAPS4 you want your kids to excersize and get healthier? @CAPS1 friends kids always are on the computer everyday all the time and thats not verry healthy @CAPS3 them especialy because they're young. So a couple of weeks ago I talked to them about being active and how its not good to be on the computer alot. Now they bearly go on the computer they always are outside and playing and running around. @CAPS1 science teacher @PERSON3 says that ""@CAPS5 excersize is better than doing anything non active also it can be fun. @NUM2 out of @PERCENT2 of kids agree with @CAPS1 science teacher @PERSON2. In this paragraph I am going to explain to you why I think interacting with family and friends is better than on the computer. If you were in your familys shoes @CAPS4 you think that they would rather have you come hang out with them or be on the computer? When I was younger @CAPS1 family used to have to yell at me to get me off the computer so I could hang out with them but finaly a day come when I got to understand their family pain. @CAPS1 mom says that ""I should hang out with @CAPS1 family and friends more often."" @NUM3 out of @PERCENT3 of @CAPS1 family members and friends agree with @CAPS1 mom. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 conclusion I disagree with the statement ""Some people support advances and technology belive that computers have a positive effect on people."" @CAPS1 reason as @CAPS3 why is that people arent @CAPS5 enough sleep, less time excersizing, and less time interacting with friends and family."	4	5		9																					
305	1	"Computers, a very much talked about subject. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of homes in @LOCATION1 own at least one computer. And that goes for about @PERCENT2 in @LOCATION2. Some people don't like that this is true, but on the other hand some people do. I have a computer, it can do so much, for example it can help me with writing, I can play games on it and socialize with social networking sites and ""I.M.'s"", it can even help me order a product form a website like @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION3, or @LOCATION4. Like I said, I have a computer and I can use it to help me write. At school in english, I would use my computer to help me with a writing prompt. I also use it to write conclusions for science labs. There are a lot of other kids that do this as well, it really is very helpful. That is only one of the reasons I think computers are beneficial to society. Another reason I think computers are beneficial to society is because you can play games on them, like ""world of warcraft"", ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1"", or classics like ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5"". There are millions of people that play games on the computer. Also you can socialize with social networking sites, like @CAPS6 and twitter, and also because you can ""I.M."" your friends. I.M. stands for @CAPS7 messaging, and it is kind of like email except it is just about instantaneous, and so you and friend can have a conversation over the computer. Also there is video chatting, where it is kind of like a phone except you can see the person you're talking to and it is over the computer, so it is almost like you and the person you are videochatting with are meeting face to face, but your not. A third reason I feel that computers are beneficial to society is because you can order a product over the internet form shop websites. For example, I got my @CAPS8 from @LOCATION3, and also the bulb for a @CAPS9 in my house is wearing out, so my dad is going to buy a @LOCATION1 bulb on @ORGANIZATION1. It is things like this that make life that much easier for the @CAPS10 @PERSON1, because this way these people don't have to drive to the store to buy something, that is, if they can wait a week or two for the product to arrive. These are the kinds of things that make me feel that computers are beneficial to society. I know they might not be the best reasons, but they are quite important to me. Being able to type essays, play games and socialize, and order products form websites is just amazing. These are some of the reasons that I and others love computers. But I have a question for you, why do you like or dislike computers?"	5	5		10																					
306	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are important for growth. They teach us skills like hand-eye coordination, they allow you to talk online, and learn about faraway people and places. I do believe that it benefits society even though many people dont. Nine out of @NUM1 schools use computers on a daily basis and their community is still fine. I know you think its taking away real social time but it really is improving the community. Imagine a student playing basketball, and his teamate passes the ball to him and he can't catch it because he has no hand-eye coordination skills. That wouldnt happen to him if he spent more time on the computer. There are many coordination games on the internet, like pinball of @CAPS1, that help build that up. When you play those games you keep your hand on the mouse or keyboard and your eyes on the screen. It helps you to not look down. When you play basketball, you can catch the ball and still throw it if you have good coordination. out of @NUM1 people keep in touch with family or friends online. Its the greatest feeling when you talk to someone you haven't seen in awhile because you know that they still remember you. When you talk to people online, you get to know them better and they tell you things that they dont want others to know. Also, when you meet up with them, you have more things to talk about. What would happen if you were to go to a location that you thought was nice, but it turned out to be the worst place ever? It would be terrible, but if you looked it up on the internet, you would know the truth about it. Lets say you want to know about someone famous, you look it up on the computer. There are many educational things on the computer that can help you out in life. I do agree with you on one thing. Society is losing its communication skills. Being on the computer all the time isn't doning anyone good. Nobodys picking up the phone and calling their friends to talk. They are distancing themselves from everyone but their computer. We dont want out society to stay this way. The people who spend their day on the computer need to change. I think computers are an asset to the community. Many people believe that computers are ruining everything, but they really aren't. Computers are good for learning about people and places. The question is, do you want people to refrain from using computers? Now is the time to decide, do you want us to use computers to furter our education or not?"	4	4		8

Today in america over @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 all people own a computer, according to the @ORGANIZATION1 are most definatly a benifit to today's socity for the reasons that it allows better and easier world comunications, makes text and information, more redily avalible to the public and allows the advancements in technology that are nessesary.

343	1	"Dear editor, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 and I am a @NUM1 year old girl; yet active in reading the daily newspaper. As I was going through last weeks newspapers, I saw an ad to write an article about either the negative or positive factors about computers. I am here to persuade other readers about the negative affects computers have on people. As an active member of the computer, I take part in all negative factors. People who spend more than one hour on the computer are involved in @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or playing a computer game. of those kids are too involved in their compute games. I saw this segment on @CAPS5 @NUM2 about how @PERCENT1 of all teens play on the computer atleast once when they are supposed to be homework. Computer games distract from kids learning. Kids feel that @CAPS3 is more inportant than doing math homework. Computers don't benefit to kids learning. Kids or even adults who are too involved in some use of computers don't want to talk. They feel they need to focus on winning and beating all their friends. To win, people can't talk, just focus on the game. Kids who need to win and not talk could lead to lifetime results. Being self-consious or having no social skills are the biggest lifetime results from being too involved in a computer game. That is how being too involved in computer games affects their social skills. Kids who are too involved in their computer games, don't get enough exrcersize causing obsity. Kids think they are getting exrcersize by playing but in reality they are doing nothing at all. Kids think they can't leave their game, but they can. there is always a pause button somewhere on the screen. Soon kids get addicted to playing and dont think going outside is important anymore. That is how computer games cause long term effects. In conclusion, computers have no benefits on people. Computers cause no learning to be done anti-socialism, and abesity. All of these results are long term which causes you life to be okay. I dont you want a happy and successful life?! I know I do!"	5	4		9

You can make a presantation or check your email. All of those things make work easier. And there are tons of more things you can do. As I said before they can help people learn. You can learn trillions of things on the internet. You can learn about everything on the internet and it is quite amazing. You could get a medical degree on the internet. Makeing work easyer or helping people learn aren't the extent of the computers abilitys. Computers can prevent acidents in anything that moves. For example cars millions on the road today and some can practily drive them selves. And that is all done with computers. Also planes, the only reason the piolot is there is in case something gose wrong. Same thing with trains. Furthermore @CAPS1 are completly computerized all the humans do is tell the computer what they want it to do. Almost everything that moves within its own power has been computerized at some point in time. And that makes the world safer for every one. Finaly computers save lives, its completly true. In hospitals without computers people would be dieing every day. They use them to keep records, record vital signs and asist with surgery. In surgery computers help by only haveing to make a tiny insision and can be much more acurate than human sergons which save lives. Also computers can mak sure that a operating room is completly sterial which reduces risks of infection. As you can see computers benifit society a lot more than you might think. They help people learn and make work easyer. They prevent acidents with which reduces people going to the hospital. And if they do go they are almost garenteed a survival. So what do you think about them now."	4	5		9																					
354	1	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 the years computers has been a great invention. It helped people learn more information, communicate with people, and @CAPS6 invent more technology. This is a positive effect for our country. let me excplain. Computers is a positive affect for our country because it helps us find information for school and for location were to go. The computer helps me find information for my science project faster than going to the library and looking up information on a book."" @CAPS2 @PERSON1 in @NUM1 grade. In case we get lost on the roads the computer can @CAPS6 us get to out location. Another reason why computers is a positive affect to our country is because it can @CAPS6 us communicate with our friends and family.""@CAPS3 I cant contact my mom I email her on my computer."" @CAPS2 @PERSON2. Also most of kids parents can contact their teacher and email them to see how they are doing. The last reason why computers is a positive affect to our country is because it can @CAPS6 us invent diffrent things. Scientist can easily invent more kinds of technology by using the computers."" The computer has helped us first make a model of our invention then we start making the details."" @CAPS4 @CAPS5. @CAPS1 the years computers helped us with almost everything. Conclusion the computer @CAPS6 us with our search for information, @CAPS6 contact people, and @CAPS6 make new inventions. This has also helped us in wars. We should let the computers be in the @LOCATION1"	4	4		8																					
364	1	"You've got mail! @CAPS1 my computer which is filled with emails from distant relatives and friends. Without computers, I would not be able to keep in touch with these people as efficiently as I can with computers. In the past few decades, technology has been drastically advancing, resulting in the incredible computers, with computers we can type faster, communicate with distant relatives, and find information like ever before. Because of this incredible invention, computers have allowed us to do @LOCATION1 things that are truly astonishing. To begin, we have thrown away typr writers and purchased computers. Now like never before, we can type faster, improve hand eye cordination, and edit our papers without the help of a peer. First of all, with the extreene amounts of typing needed for colleges, most occupations, and everyday list, computers have made this faster and easier process. I am sure most of the things you have to type for @LOCATION1 are written using a computer. Secondly we have gained amazing hand-eye cordination skills. Furthermore, be typing and reading at the same time, we have trained or eyes to do many @LOCATION1 things similar to playing the piano. Lastly, now with spell check, we are able to edit papers without using someone elses help! The computer can sense problems in an instant, which is even more effective without a doubt, the typing documents aspect of computers is @CAPS5 one reason why we need them around. Another reason is because of communication. Thanks to many @LOCATION1 communication applications such as @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, we can now communicate with a surplus of distant friends and relatives. For example, with both my sisters at college it was hard for me to communicate with them however, due to @CAPS2, I can see their pictures, instant message them, and even video chat! Without computers, being able to see their pictures and what they are up to would have never been possible. Secondly, email has created a fast, easy way to update people on schedule changes, ideas and even sales and specials offered by stores! Snail mail is no more with this extreemly efficient way of communication! Clearly, the communication aspect of computers is an explicit reason why we need them in our lives. Last but not least, computers have allowed us to access information like never before. We can now find facts and figures, faster, easier, and with hundreds more optinions, within seconds, thanks to @ORGANIZATION1 and other search engines, we can find the information we need. Not to mention, the process is exceedingly @CAPS5 type in exactly what you are looking for and you will be brought to exactly what you need! Thirdly, there is many more options and sites to choose from. For example, if you were to type in a certain animal there would be an overdose of pages pertaining to your topic. Now, it is possible to find exactly what you are looking for! There is no question that computers have made searching for information easier and faster, which is exactly why we need them in our everyday lives. Conclusively, computers are an astonishing invention that has opened @LOCATION1 doors for today's society. Without computers we would not be able to type documents as quickly, communicate, and find information in a fashion. However, because of this invention, computers have allowed us to do incredible things. People all across the country are expenencing the efficiency of using computers and now we can to! It is evident, that computers are effective, and are advancing technology in our society."	6	5		11																					
369	1	"Do you use a computer? Is there one at your house? Well, the average household owns two computers, but this isn't good, @CAPS2 computers are taking valuable time away from hobbies, nature, and real-life. First, computers take time away from hobbies and friends. Some of my friends spend @NUM1 hours on the computer a day that they could be playing. a sport or hanging out. Also, the computers become the center of their lives. People ask me "" @CAPS1 weren't you online @TIME1?"" and i answer ""@CAPS2 i have a life that doesn't revolve around @CAPS3."" @CAPS4, the computer takes time away from nature. People dont acknowledge the beauty of the outdoor. Now that our lives are so orderly, we need the wilderness even more than @CAPS2 it helps us to appreciate ourselves more and appreciate how special our planet computer take all that away! Third, computers take us away from real-life. Some people dont know how to have a face-to-face conversation, they only know how to communicate by email or @CAPS5. I acknoowledge that getting away from real life can be relaxing but some people dont know which side the stomp goes on a letter. It @MONTH1 old-fashioned, but i believe people put their heart something you can't do by email. In conclusion, computers take time away from real-life, nature and your hobbies. Plus, you can get arthritis in your hands if you type to much."	4	4		8																					
371	1	"About @PERCENT1 of the world today, use computers. Although you @MONTH1 spend time on the computer, you can contact family and frinds, exercise your brain, and there is time to enjoy nature. Have you ever heard of a email? Well it's a contacting source you can use to contact family and friends. Also there are other sources you can use to conact family and friends. For example, facebook, myspace, and twitter. Even though you're on the computer, you can still do this, you don't always have to call them. I remember a time when I called my aunt from my cell phone, and it wasted my minutes. Something simple as this could've been done over an email. So computers do have a good point to it. Do you know online you can exercise your brain? You can do this by learning new information you haven't learned before. For instance, if my sister needed help with science, she could go online, and learn more information about it. Some experts are thinking that it's too much time on the computer, but it can be very useful to others, by helping them gain knowledge. Computers can even help get online, tutoring, so you can exercise your brain there also. Do you know you can enjoy nature anytime? About @PERCENT2 of our world enjoys nature. Don't you think it can wait until later? Also some people don't like the different seasons and might want to stay in their homes. For example, when it snows. I think nature is good, but I don't think others want to be out as much. Also I know we are apart of nature, and nature is part of our society, but the seasons change and it's lots od bad weather. In conclusion, the computer has some good sources. Although you @MONTH1 spend time on the computer, you can contact family exercise your brain and there time to nature."	4	4		8																					
375	1	I not agreed the people shuld d in the computer a lot and I going to said way. My first reason is because if you are a @NUM1 old man or your not going to d wit your kids and you going to have eyes problem so thas way you shuld in d in the computer a lot. My secon reason is the you going to have problem wit your wife if she found out the you are talking to another woman online because a lot of people they wife found out the they cant d wit other woman. My teard reason is the if you are a kid like me you not going to have fun and you not going to have friends because the computer problem came and go and not going to d wit your family and you lil sister out said playing wit her. So thas why you shulding d a lot in the computer.	2	2		4																					
378	1	"Dear local Newspaper, I have heard that there is a controversy over if computers benefit our society. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they have beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. If we were in a world without computers then our society would be completely lost. First off, one contributing factor is that computers help us keep in contact. Any one person can simply send an email by a click of a button. However, if this device was not around, we would have to use postal service or the telephone, both of which cost money. Why wouldn't you want a computer? What happens if a hurricane is abroad, and a family has no idea of its presence? All they need to do is check their email or the internet to realize what danger they are in. Calling somebody is risky because they could not be able to ansuer for any reason. In a situation like this, computers became essential to everyone. Clearly, the ability to contact is a great reason why computers need to be kept. Secondly, computers help us complete our daily work. Almost everyone works during the week, and if you @MONTH1 not realize it, we get most of our help from computers. Let's say that a man or women is ath theiroffice and they need to create a power point in order to share the companies new brand. All he/she needs to do is turn on their computer and begin to work with a blink of an eye. But without this device, what would they be able to do? How would they complete their work? The need for a @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or laptop is obviously great when you work. Lastly, computers give us the ability to play games and browse the internet freely. When I go home, usually I go straight to my computer like most teenagers do. I can easily check scores or last nights games, listen to music, and play solitaire by myself. I dont need to turn on the @CAPS3 and wait throve . All of these tiresome commercials. I don't need to grab a @CAPS4 and throw it into a boombox. I don't need to grab all the playing carols and set a game up. All I need is my computer. Without a doubl the fun and helpful computers such as games help us out. Although some say that computers aren't needed they help us throughout our lives. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they are beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. All of these facts to one final solution, which is keeping computers in our society."	6	5		11																					
385	1	"Dear Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk online with other people. The invention of computers is the single most important event of the @DATE1. @PERSON1, a professor at @ORGANIZATION3 says that ""the invention of computers has led to hundreds even thousands of new discoveries. This week alone, @CAPS3 have discovered @NUM1 new drugs that could put an end to cancer."" A report in @ORGANIZATION1 stated that @PERCENT1 of fortune @NUM2 companies are run soley by computer programs. @ORGANIZATION1 also state that the other @PERCENT2 of fortune @NUM2 companies plan to switch to computer based operations by the end of @DATE2. For personal use, computers allow you to communicate with your fellow peers in order to work on school projects. Computers make life easier in general and can help with all life throws at you. First, computer teach hand-eye coordination and can improve reflexes and reaction time. Computer based video games can prepare you for real life tasks and challenges by improving your physical skills. Numerous flight simulators and driving simulators are available on the consumer market. In this day and age, flight schools require their students to complete hundreds of hours of flight simulators. Some driving schools even make their students learn to drive in a simulator before hitting the open road. Other games such as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, require you to think on your feet and can improve your reflexes. This @CAPS2 maker you dodge bricks and can greatly improves reaction time as well. All of the programs available via the computer can help you with real life obstacles and make you think createvly. Next, computers allow you to learn about faraway places and people. This is espicially interesting because you can learn about a countries culture without actually going there. This oppurtunity allows you to imerse yourself in different cultures and religions and would make it easier to relate to people to in faraway lands. @CAPS4 once said ""@CAPS3 are afraid of only what is different than us, therefore, @CAPS3 have nothing to fear if nothing is different."" @CAPS4 meant that if @CAPS3 know about people and places different than use, @CAPS3 do not have to be afraid of anything. Computers allow us to see people all around the world an learn about them. Seeing different things enriches our life and can make us better people. Lastly, the invention of computers allows us to communicate with people from all around the world. With the invention of @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS6, @CAPS3 can talk to friends that move out of town. @ORGANIZATION2 reported that of its @NUM4 million users, @NUM5 million users have friends that live in a different country. When I was @NUM6, my friend @PERSON2 move to @LOCATION1. @CAPS3 missed each other until I turned @NUM7 and @ORGANIZATION2 was invented. @CAPS3 were both online one day and I searched his name to see if he had an account. He did and @CAPS3 immeadiatly started video chatting on a weekly basis. Programs like @CAPS5 allow you to make new friends as well as reconnect with old friends. In short, the birth of computer has allowed for vast improvement in society as a whole. Individuals can talk with friends who live in different countries as if they were in the same room. Businessmen and women can have meetings on the computer with programs such as @CAPS8. Government officials can talk with other leaders from around the world. Despite some people that think the advent of computer has affected communication. I belive that it is an effective too that everybody should have access to."	5	6		11																					
388	1	"Almost everyone is effected by computers in some sort of way. Some people think computers are bad because some people spend too much time on their computers. The thing is computers help us with our everyday life. If we want to comunicate with people from around the world to send donations to places in need like @LOCATION1 or @CAPS1, we can use computers to do that. We can chang people's lifes in third world countries with the help of computers. Computers can also help us in school. When a student has to write a report and he has bad handwriting he can just type it up and print it. Or if a student has to do research for an essay she can find the information easily on the computer. Maybe a kid forgot his homework, he can go to his school website and find it. My last point would be that computers are a huge help for buisnesses. When files are lost or misplaced, the worker(s) can use the computer and bring up the back-up file. When they need to order supplies, most times they will go to a web site and order online. Or when updates are posted about up coming events in that company, an e-mail is sent out and is found using a computer. Many people think that people overuse their computers, but that the users fault not ours. We should choose how long were using one computers. Many jobs would be impossible with out computers. It's not about overusing them its about. So over all I say computers are good and very useful when used in the right hands."	4	3		7																					
392	1	"Many people like computer and like to use them for many different kinds of reason. Some people use them to get online education. Other use them to talk to family and friends that are far away. Also student use them to do research for school. These are reason why computer could be a good devices. There are many people that now have the ability to get a online education because of problem that they have. For example people that can't walk and don't like going to regular school. The computer would help them find website that they could get a free education. The computer would see what level there in like a regular teacher. The computer would make it so easy and better for the people that don't have the ability to walk they can even study for test that they have on the computer. This one reason why many people use computer. Many family use computer to try to look for freind that they haven't seen in a long time or family that are far away. They even contact them by chatting threw websites. They also search for addressed and phone number. Many people get to find there family threw internets. They meet in spot are even come to one another hauses. The computer would allow their dreams to happen by finding their familys. This would be an exciting event for them this why they need computer. This is one very important reason student use computer to research projects. Without computer student won't be able to look for information they need to know. The computer would teach student about people in the past they didn't know or didn't got to meet. The computer would influence them to want to learn more about interesting history. Children need computer to make there intelligence go up higher. These are some reason why I think we all need computer. We need them for people that don't have the ability to walk, for people that have family and friend far away, and for student that would like to learn more. These are all things people enjoy doing on a computer. If there are no computer it would crush everybody dream and future. So this are some reason why many people decide to be on computer."	4	4		8																					
399	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I have heard that people are thinking of how computers are having a bad effect on people and I disagree. Computers help people so much in schools, work places, and at home. Not having computers would have a worse effect on people then with having computers. For students it is an absolute neccesity to do research , and type essays, letters and so many other writing pieces, and the same goes for all of society. In almost every school all over the country, students use computers on a daily basis. I personally have to log into the computer to type an essay for a class at least twice a week and some @ORGANIZATION1 even more. For example my @CAPS1 teacher asks our class to write a lot of essays or letters. She has told us over and over that if our hand writing is not good she won't grade it. Having the computers to type on removes the fact that if our teacher can't read it she can't grade it. I understand that people would say that it makes people need to hand write the things a lot less and people would lose the ability to hand write things but with such advenced technology on computers and to type anything with such pose, soon hand writing will no longer ne required. Any person for whatever research they need can be found so easily using a computer. For students in any grade level and any class, research projects are going to be assigned by a teacher. Using books and other means of research are slow and in efective. Getting onto a computer and looking up the pic is fast and simple and gives better results than books. The same goes for jobs, for example a person might need to set up a powerpoint presentation. Not only does the computer have powerpoint on it - which is an effective way of setting up projects the computer allows that person to do research all in one place. This makes it so much simplier to get a lot of information and not have to run around getting books and talking to people who know the subject. I understand that computers could ""take control"" of people and people would spend to much time on them. But of the few that do stay on computers to long learn to balance their time, keeping computers would benefit in so many ways. Writing many different essays, letters, typing for projects, and doing research would be done faster and easier."	4	4		8																					
403	1	"Dear Local @CAPS1, I think that computers have a posotive effect on people. There is many ways computers can have posotive effects on humans, first computers bring people together and let people interact with each other, They let people talk to each other. Computers also let people learn about new things. The internet has so much information. Computers also let people do things that they can't do with out computers. So computers have a positive effect on people. Computers let people interact with each other. The computers bring people together. People can use the internet to send emails to each other. When you need to write a letter to some one it might take days for them to got it. But with email they would get it the second you send it. There is also website like face book that let you talk to your friends websites like that connect people. When you and you freind cant talk together you just have to get on you computer. Computers also have web camera, those let people talk to echother. and you can see them. It lets people see the other persons facial expressions and hear the there voice which is better than on a phone and writing a letter to someone thats why computers are a positive effect on people Computers also let you learn about new things when ever you want to find somthing out or if you have a question you go to the internet. If you someone else they might not know the answer. Computer let people see pictures and videos. If you wanted to see a picture of @CAPS2 are that you are going into a computer and type it in computers let people see pictures that they couldn't see in real life. Vidios let you watch things like something funny to cheer up you day. If you love a show on to, and you missed it you can find it on computer. That is why computer benifit people positively. Computers also let you do things that you couldn't do without. When a teacher asks me to type a paper I always do it on the computer. If there were no computers I would have to use a typewriter and if I made a mistake I would have to type the whole thing again. Computers also alow you to play music. On the computer you can put a cd in and it will play the music. Computers alow you to do things that couldnt do without Computers benifit society an have a positive effect on people, They let people interact with each other and they bring people together. They let people talk to each other. Computers also let you learn about newthings. They also let you do things that you couldnt do without. Computers have many positive effects on people so I hope you agree that computers benifit soctity"	4	4		8																					
406	1	"Dear local newspaper I disagree because people should just enjoying spending time with famimely and not on the computer  doing nothing do you agree with me so far? Frist of being if you wast all you're time being of the computer there is nothing there is nothing you can get done as I have notice many shildren are on computer every right after school playing on the computer. For example my cosiun is on the computer evryday doing  but wasting his time are you still with me. Secondly children should be studying on the computer not playing video games and going in website that are not allowed more then @NUM1 do students and children are on the internet palying video games and doing something the is done everyday also I have seen many kids playing games on the computer. Thirdly student will never learn nothing if they wast there time because computer is for studing and many students don't have there time wisely as they should also many student should be useing comput only sometimes not everyday I have notice that so many students don't learn from compu for because they are not studing tests mre then @PERCENT1 stundent fail classes because of computer. First of people should be spending time with  and friends because they are teh most important people aroun ud not computers. Are still with me? Secondly friends are the most important people I ever had because they care about and love you like you're ther families but what if you just wast youre on computer how are you know all your friends. For example m allways on comput never goes to see her friemds amd her friends to to here because she never cares about their only computer do god get what im saying here. Thirdly family is also important then just being on the computer because they care about you have to at lease spend sometime with family for example many families stop spending time with each othe because computer is important to them. Lastly help you're community is goal because you make you\re city look you don't want it he be massy also many people quit help with commicity servic around the neighbor for example I have see  trash on grounds and because they dont care. Finally going out doing sports and starting fit is very important. First of playing sports is far and youve health but people never play sports anymore just because computer for example @NUM2 people stop playing sports, secondly going to is very import because is good."	4	4		8																					
409	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1. I am @NUM1 years old and I go to a @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 called @ORGANIZATION1. I am a really smart kid. In @CAPS1 opinion I benefit people using computers. You should keep reading @CAPS1 essay because I am going to tell you @NUM2 good reasons why I benefit people using computers. @CAPS1 first reason is they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. For example, when I am always using the computer and when I'm doing research it always gives me the ability to learn about new places and people. Another example is when ever I watch @CAPS2.V on @CAPS3 @NUM3 it says that people learn about learn about faraway places and people on the internet @PERCENT1 of the time. @CAPS1 second reason is it allows people to talk online with other people for example when I am on the computer everyday I visit @CAPS1 facebook it always gives me a chance to talk to @CAPS1 friends and other people online. Another example is when I go on a computer and I search computers.org it says that it lets people @PERCENT2 of the time talk to others online. @CAPS1 @NUM4 reason is it allows students to get information when they're doing a project. For example when I always use the @ORGANIZATION1 computers it allows me to get information for example, about @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 govina that is why I benefit people using computers. Another example is when ever I check out a magazine on computers it tells me that kids get alot of information when they're doing projects @PERCENT2 of the time. In conclusion, I benefit people using computers because they teach hand eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, it allows people to talk online with other people and it allows students to get information when they're doing projects. Those are the @NUM2 reasons why I benefit people using computers. So please the local newspaper please try to make this believable."	4	4		8																					
421	1	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I, for one do not. I think a decent amount of time on the computer, you can benefit from. But I do belive that computers are a huge part of peoples lives now. I think that people should get off the computer, and get some exercise more and more people would be so much healthier, if they took the time they were on the computer and exercised instead. On the computer you can look up places and see beautiful pictures of places, nature, and even people. But if people got off the computers and traveled and enjoyed nature, they would be able to live it, not just see a picture. Everything would be so much more fun if you were there and got to experience it, not just read about it. Another reason why I feel so strongly about people spending less time on computers is because they don't spent much time interacting with family and friends when you are the computer to much it seems like you drift away from you friends and family. Almost as if you are to ""busy"" to see them. So as you can see I highly disagree with the overuse of computers."	3	3		6																					
424	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers have a very positive effect on people. @CAPS13 reasons are that they can educate @CAPS1, they make things easy, they are enjoyable. Below, I will explain each reason. Firstly, its very educational. Computer are like a giant resource of information. Many teachers @MONTH1 direct their students online @CAPS2 learning purposes. Also, alot of people go online to research information @CAPS2 their school, job, or a project. Great websites that are packed with information, like @ORGANIZATION1, can only be accessed using a computer. @CAPS2 example imagine having to do your research using only books, but you live far @CAPS6 a library. The internet makes that research very easy, as you access to @CAPS7 any time! Secondly, they make things very easy to do. Computer provide people with many easy, convieniant ways to do many tasks. If there werent any computers in the world. don't you think that interacting with people around the world would be challenging? Almost all of the @CAPS4/@CAPS5 in the @LOCATION2 like @PERSON1's, @ORGANIZATION2, or @PERSON2's have an online website to aid shoppers & they even allow them In buy things online, which is way more easy than going by car. I remember a time when I wanted to by something @CAPS6 a store all the way in @LOCATION1 I went online at home and bought @CAPS7 there! Also, @CAPS7 makes things like ordering @CAPS8, getting plane tickets, getting help alot much easier & @CAPS7 saves time! Thirdly, computers are very enjoyable! They provide alot of @CAPS17 things to do! @CAPS2 example if you are bored you can get on computer, & search @CAPS2 a game you enjoy. There is always a game you'll like. On of all of that, you enjoy @CAPS7 by talking to your friends and Family. You stay in touch, while enjoying their company. Another good thing that people enjoy about these computers is because they can send things to one another, lightining @CAPS10 because of email. Imagine that you don't have a phone, and you wanted to tell your husband that is away on a business trip, that you son is very sic. If you send @CAPS7 by mail, @CAPS7 take at least @NUM1 days. By email, only a couple minutes so, you can see that computer also can provide some @CAPS11 of safety @CAPS2 everybody! So, as you can see computers have a very positive effect on people @CAPS13 ways that they do this is that they are educational & they help @CAPS1 learn. They make things like ordering @CAPS8, getting tickets, or contacting helpl very easy @CAPS15, they are very enjoyable, @CAPS6 playing @CAPS17 games, to staying in touch with your Friends and Family. Don't you think that without computers we'd probably suffer? I think computers have a great effect on people"	5	4		9																					
427	1	"To: The @ORGANIZATION1 can be a big part mof people's lives, however, some don't realize the negative effect these pieces of technology have. First, staring at a computer screen is unhealthy for your body. Secondly, anyone can post information on a website, therefore, it can be inaccurate. Lastly, people tend rely on computers too much. Computers are negatively impacting our society! The first reason why clearly, computers are not benefiting people is because they can cause unhealthy symptoms. For example, if you are playing games on the computer for hours, it can strain your eyes. This can cause you to feel tired and drowsy after being on the computer. Also, statistics show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own computers. Could this be the cause of obesity in @LOCATION1? Computers could very well be restricting people from wanting to go outside and excercising to maintain a healthy lifestyle and weight. Computers are obviously unfit for our bodies in many ways. Have you ever wondered if the information on a website is completely accurate and true? I know I have. Anyone who has access to a computer can post information on a blog, website, or communication site (such as twitter, facebook, or myspace). Not everyone who posts articles is an expert on that topic; the information could very well be false! More and more @CAPS1 use computers to get the information they need, which could, in the long run, be hurting them. Books are much more accurate! They have to be revised by editord, and are written by people who definitely know what they're talking about! Therefore, computers are, without-a-doubt, hurting our nation because of false facts. Lastly, computers have a negative effect because we rely on them too much! For example let's say you are writing a paper on the computer that is due tomorrow. You save it, and then close down the computer because you have to go eat dinnder. Later, you come back to the laptop to find that your paper isn't there anymore! You look all over your folders; but it's gone. Computers always have technical glitenes, but you don''t always have time to go to the tech help store to fix it. However, if you had written out the paper, it wouldn't have randomly disappeared! @CAPS4 people depend on computers too much, it can backfire and cause a @CAPS3 problem for you. My sixth grade teachers once said, ""@CAPS4 I was in college, I had a big french paper due. I worked hard all night to get it done. Then, @CAPS4 I went back to print it, it had been erased. I had to rewrite the whole thing again!"" Computers have a big negative effect on society because we tend to depend on them too much. In conclusion, computers are hurting our society, clearly, they are unhealthy for our bodies. Also, the information on the computers internet might be naccurate. Lastly, we rely on computers too much, which leads to problems. I strongly believe we should recluce our dependence on computers! "	6	5		11																					
431	1	"Dear officials at the @ORGANIZATION1, have you ever been so bored that you spent the whole day on the computer talking to friends and relatives? Some experts are saying that computers are having a negative effect on people in our society. While others argue that they are very helpful. the use of computers has been taken to an extreme level, and is having a negative effect on the community. Some reasons I feel this way are because of the social limit computors are putting on people and the amount of time people spend on them. My last reason is that computers are the general health of people today. People should be educated on the negative effects computers bring! Firstly, computers are greatly changing the way people communicate. Instead of talking to people communicate. Instead of talking to people face-to-face, teenagers and adults find themselves '@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2"" their friends and colleges. This is causing many bad-habit forming. People are it more to talk to physically, and might even be using terms like ""@CAPS3"" and ""@CAPS4"" instead of works. This problem is causing a huge gap in the social-wonangs of humans, and is harming them more know! Secondly, the amount of time wasted on the computer is unbelieveable! If someone logged onto the computer to search a fact or ""@CAPS5"" something, they might get caught up in other programs and spend hours on the computor. This time could have been used for more productive things instead. A recent polls shows that that average person from ages @NUM1 spreads over two hours on the computer each day! This fact is quite amazing, because these people could have been getting more things accomplished in this time. The amount of time wastedon computers is a huge problem that needs to change! Lastly, humans' health is being affected drastically by the use or computers. As the obesity rate is rising, these people are just sitting on their computors watching it go up. During this time, they could be exercising, going to the gym, or even taking a walk with friends. Teenagers could be playing outdoors, but find themselves too busy on their computors to enjoy the fresh air. Whenever I talk to my friends, they usually say they are on facebook or oovoo instead of outside or playing with their siblings. The obesity rate will keep rising if these people don't realize that staying on computers all day long is a part of the problem! In conclusion, the use of computers has gotten to a point where it is hurting society, rather than it I feel this way because of the social-flow it is teaching people, and the amount of time wasted on computers. Another major reason is because of the extreme health issues computers are. If the average person tried! to limit the time they use their computers, they would notice a positive in their life-style!"	5	6		11																					
435	1	"Most adults beileve that computers are just awaist of time and are somtimes can be addicting or bad for health. Well its true it can be bad, but it matters how you use it. There is one thing about the computer that is amazing. That is socilizing with friends, family or even strangers. You know when your parents say never talk to strangers well, you can do this saftely and harmless over the computer, and you also learn alot about life or other peoples life outside your small little town. There is another @CAPS1 perk with computers and that is keeping in touch with family or friends that live far away. My sister went to @LOCATION1 for six months, but the thing was it felt like two weeks because I was able to communicate and se pictures of here @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The last but probably the most important part is getting ahold of. People you actually really need talk to, such as friends, teachers or even people you never talk to in school. With these three advanced ways to soliaze it will always feel like your never alone which an awsome thing. There is many other things the computer is used for other than social life, and that is actuall important use, stuff you need to know or want to find out. Here is one example, everone has forgot there work at school or your office at least once in your life. Well with being able to just grab all the papers off line is easy. Just go to your teachers home page and just print your homework. Its that easy just one click and that saved you a twenty minuet ride to school. How about when your up at night wondering what the weather is going to be lik, many sunny, cold or even a glorious snow day. Well instead of waiting to find out you can just go on weather.com and see everything maps, forecast or what is going to happen hour by hour. Just like weather people always want to know breaking news. Why watch an two hour show when you can just get to the point off whats happening in this world we live in. I mean the parents have to open there eyes and seethis a buetiful thing. We should be proud of the fact that humans have created somthing so complex and intresting. There is one more topic that I know youre going to absoltly love. I mean right now your grading this in your office, well you can be grading this at home on your comfortble couch, with a fire crackling and all the peace and quiet in the worl. People work from home all the time. you can run a business from your very own living room. My father owns company and works from home most days. Its absoutly @CAPS1 be is able to take me out, spend time with the family and most importantly doing the things he loves and guess what, you can do this too. Like I keep saying its only a click away here is another topic, online banking. Do you really want to drive to the bank and sit down with that borring acountant and spend hours there, well, now you don't have to waste your time, you can type in a couple keys and boom, your on your way to see your information. That was faster then two hours i'm guessing. Yes, I believe that computers are a @CAPS1 use of time and will also help alot in the future. So the next time you log on to your comptuer do some of these things and turst me your will think exactly what I think."	6	5		11																					
437	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, the effects of computers are not good. Many people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising. People are on their computers so much that they dont enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with family and friends that much. I think that computers are becoming an issue. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in my school agree that they hardly exersize any more because they are always on their computers. For example, @NUM3 year old @CAPS1 used to go to the gym everyday before she got her own computer. Now every afternoon she finds herself in front of the computer monitor. If it wasn't for computers, I'm sure kids would be outside getting exersize. Computers are a serious issue. Have you ever found yourself in front of the computer screen, on a beautiful day outside? I have, and while I was on the computer I could have been outside enjoying nature. I think it would be best if you unplugged those computers for a day and just went outside and got some fresh air! If everybody keeps this habit of staying on your computers all day and not going outside, we might turn into a world of couch potatos! Im sure you dont want that. Lastly, I remember multiple times I said I would do something with my dad but I didnt because I was on the computer. Many people can agree with me. Instead of going out to interact with your friends many are just instant messaging them. The internet is amazing, but I think everyone forgot the joy of going out with friends and family. So get off those computers and call a friend. In conclusion, the effects of computers are bad. Many people are spending too much time on their computers and have less time exersising. They are on so much they dont enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with friends and family. I think after reading this you can see computers arent good."	4	4		8																					
438	1	"Dear newspaper, People are spending to much time on their computers. They are on the computers when they should be exercising. People need to enjoy nature and spend time with family and friends. Let me explain more. Firstly, the people who are consently @CAPS1 people, facebooking people, or on myspace aren't getting exercise. Now, more than ever people are becoming very obese. It is very unhealthy. People in my family that are always on facebook are not getting exercise, and becoming overweight. Eight out of ten @CAPS2 aren't getting enough exercise. We need to get people moving and exercising. Secondly, People need to enjoy nature. Everyone is so caught up in their computers, they don't sit back, relay and take in nature. People don't get that the earth is polluted. Once animals are extinced they are not comming back. If they got off of their computers for a minute they could see the animals before they are gone. Computers are the wall between inside and going outside in back at the world. Finaly, the computers are getting in the way of seeing family and friends. Everyone is so caught up in the newist computer they don't see their friends or family I know some people who when its time for dinner, they walk down to the kitchen. Get their food and bring if to their computer so they don't miss out on anthing family and friends are very important. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 onley see friends and family on holidays. Computers are getting in the way of everything! People arent getting the exercise they need. They aren't going outside to enjoy the nature and the arent seeing there friends and family. We need to get people off their butts and away from the computer. Why does everyone have to sit in front of the computer anyway?"	4	4		8																					
445	1	"Dear @CAPS1, In my opinion I think we should use computers. The reason why I think we should use computers because @CAPS2 we need help on something, we can find it on the computer, also because sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone, and sometimes people @MONTH1 have to go on the computer and check instant mail. Frist of all, I think we should use computers because @CAPS2 we need help on something we can find it on the computer. For example, @CAPS2 a student need help on homework they can go on google and look on the they doing and it will help. Also They can go on a website called http.historywork.com and that will also help that on what. Another reason why I think we should use computer because sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone. When I say this I mean like @CAPS2 you have a computer connect with them on the computer. For example like @CAPS2 you have a gmail, facebook, yahoo or myspace you can talk to you friends at there. I do it all the time. Last reason why I that we should use computer is because sometimes @MONTH1 have to go on the for example @CAPS2 you @MONTH1 had important message the website and you message you. I do it why can't you. So yes I do their."	4	4		8																					
450	1	"Dear Readers, I believe that spending time on the computer has its pros and cons. For the good things people are able to do research talk to people such as friends and family and also the computer can help you learn about anything you need to know about. I also think that there are some cons. People spend way to much time becomming distracted, you ignore your family without even knowing it and if you are just staring at a computer screen which can perminatly damage your eyes. I'm going to start with the good things about how computers have effects on people. The computer is great if you have to do research. If you need information on anything you can search it. Like if you have to do research on a certain project or subject the computer is the fastest way to get the information you need. Another good thing is that you have the capibility to talk to people such as friends and family. To me that is very important and I'm sure for you it is too. Thats what I believe a few of the good things are. Now, I'm going to talk about the bad things. I firmly believe that people are spending way too much time on the computer, without knowing how long has gone by! You just stare at the screen, which is not good for your eyes. It can perminatly damage them. One last thing I would like to mention, is that when you are on the computer they tend to ignore their friends and family which could be a big problem. These were just a few examples about how the computer has an effect on people."	4	3		7																					
456	1	"I think computers work @CAPS4 because it helps people with there own work. but computers do make people addicted because you mostly could do anything but mostly computers were able to use for help like work, maps, friend to find ot problems like for school it helps htem with math, science, social studies and @CAPS4 of more things. But people abuse it like ther @CAPS2 games and their dont even go outside they don't talk to there friends or even see ther friends its mostly not haven a life. And people dont feel like going to school because their over and there tired and ther just want to use the computer all day with not stopping. And so i think that people are just to addicted to compulers they dont use it for the fright reasons. Had then people get sick they could get hoadaks or they feel like puking. And they dont get to see that of things like go to the @CAPS1, @CAPS2 football, soccer, @CAPS3, valleyball or even take there own dog for a walk at the @CAPS1. @CAPS4 of people buy computers for games and @CAPS4 or muture people buy computer for there work and find were places are so the computer helps @CAPS4 but it addicted @CAPS4 of people. And computers do really break @CAPS4 because people could download a game or something and then it gives it virus. So you mostly spend about @NUM1 $ or @NUM2$ as fix it. And there new computers come and its like @NUM3$ and @NUM4$ and there different just from beand and ther go aboutmore faster. And whne people's computer break some go crazy and feel like doing some cordy stuff. Ther does feel like they does friends they only stay at the room for every they never down out at all and if they do come out the room they instly dont respect there parents they do whatever they feel like doing and they they act into troubles with the . So computers do help out sometimes they dont but maybe should make different changes."	3	4		7																					
465	1	"Computers, computers, computers. Who doesn't own them right? They teach hand eye coordination, give people to learn about faraway places and people can you actually believe some people say otherwise? I think that's pure bull !@. Computer's today help us with everyday tools, such as cars, cellphones and your everday television! Computer's also make work easier, and you interact with people! I for one think computers benefit society today, and those people who think otherwise should look into it one move step. Cellphones, cars, telephones want! There all made by mankind, but with a bit of technology. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of cars have computers biult in em? By the press of the button, all doors unlocked, by a swith the windows go down, yes, by computer. Now, how do computer's make life easier you say? Well keep reading to find out! The toothpaste, the baseball bats the pencils you we are all made by, the yoou know what! Machines, but programed with computer chips. Oh i remember when my history teacher told me that it took @NUM1 hours to make a baseball bat by a human from scratch. Now it takes like @NUM2 minutes with the help of comuters. If this isn't enough to tell you that computers benefit us, then what will?! Experts say people who use computers a lot don't get outside often to interact with family, but that's false I say! Cellphones are a everyday tool, we use them to talk with each other of long distant calls pay? Well then chat online on your own personal labtop! I hope now you believe computers do really benefit us. With there everday items we use, how they make work easier, and how it does make us interact. We use them everday, and hopefully they'll be around for the longest."	4	4		8																					
481	1	"Dear newspaper, I have heard you are creating an article on if computers are helpful or non helpful to society. I find computers as a great addition to society because they play a big role in jobs around the country and in addition display accessible information to the @CAPS1 @CAPS8? Imagine how computers have helped shape the @ORGANIZATION1, do you want to give this blessing up? Computers have proven to be a big role in job profiles all over the world. Just think @ORGANIZATION1 a sales person for instance. Sales people need their computer to store data, like on @ORGANIZATION3. By the way a study was put into place by the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to find out how many jobs find it neccessary to have computers, and the results showed that @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 jobs in @LOCATION1 need to use computers. Dr. @DR1, a computer programmer at to go industries, mentioned on the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that ""computers show up sometime in everyone's life whether they like it or not, especially in jobs"". If you think about it, people that work with computers have less trouble calculatir or storing data than citizens without computers. Just think @ORGANIZATION1 computers this way a helping brain for those who work hard. Students love having access with information around the world. I bet that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people would agree with me, don't you think? Students around the world for example @MONTH1 need to research information for a topic in class. A @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2 in @CAPS6 mentioned that, ""I prefer using the internet for research in @ORGANIZATION2. It's much more fast than looking through books, and people around the earth place opinions online instead @ORGANIZATION1 a book with a few authors."" @CAPS7 day @PERSON1 was in the library with the rest @ORGANIZATION1 his class, assigned to researching his topic in a book. He read five books and only got a half @ORGANIZATION1 a page @ORGANIZATION1 notes for his assignment. The following day he was allowed to work on the @ORGANIZATION2 computer and got three pages @ORGANIZATION1 notes. ""I was so releived to log on to the internet"", @PERSON1 reported to me. A survey was set up by the @CAPS8 foundation to see if students prefer computers over books and @PERCENT3 said yes. Do you want students @ORGANIZATION1 all ages to participate in researching on the machine they favor most? Well I dearly hope your answer benefits the children in @LOCATION1. From young students to adults, computers have become a favorite machine @ORGANIZATION1 modern day technology. Computers are a magnificent part @ORGANIZATION1 society. @MONTH1 I remind you that computers benefit many jobs in @LOCATION1 and in addition aid students by showing information about everything there is to know. I sincerely hope you share my feelings about this matter. What is your vision on computers today?"	5	5		10																					
483	1	"Dear @CAPS1, The effects computers hace on society is a mixture of positive use and negative use. Getting tired and lazy is a negative use of the computer. When you are on the computer. When you are on the computer for more than @NUM1 minutes ayou start to get lazy and not wanting to get up. That affects a lot of people @DATE1 because there are a lot of people working on their computer for there jobs and they have to use the computer. Kids are harder because they don't want to do something other than just sitting on the computer instead of when they come back from school because they are so tired, if we limit the time they use the computer it will be better for kids, grown ups, and your brain. When adults spend a lot of time on the computer due to there jobs or checking their email, a lot of times they don't interact with their family or other people because they are on the computer I can connect with this because @CAPS4 dad is always on the computer due to his office not talking to us or even seeing is. Sometimes I wish that the world should of never invented computers because I get so frustated with them, but a lot of times we do spend family time and its good to get away from your computers beside thats what makes the money. Emailing, chating, @CAPS3, aim, @CAPS2 are all echnology communication using these communcation is helpful if somebody can't text or doesn't have a phone you can always chat them on @CAPS3 or send them an email. Email & @CAPS3 are the only @NUM2 communications I @CAPS4 dad sends use a lot of emails to @CAPS4 soccer coach about how I am not going to be at a game or I am going to a game, and he always responds. It is very easy. @CAPS3 is a good way for kids to talk to one another because some might not have phones or you don't see them at all during the school day. It's a good way to communicate without @CAPS3 or email I don't know what would happen, but I knoe it would be bad. So you see how computers have positives or negatives getting lazy, not spending enough time with friends or family and talking to friends are all positive & negative conflicts of the computer."	5	4		9																					
513	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing this letter on behalf of all the busy people in our country. We have come to the conclusion that we need, not want, but need computers in our life. First, we need them to communicate to other people. Second, we need computers to do research for school and work. Lastly, us kids need computers to type essays, prompts, or papers for each class. Communication is very important in everyday life. For instance, I have a grandma that lives in @LOCATION1. I only get to see her once or twice a year in person. Throughout the entire year, I video chat with her through @CAPS3 computer because it is a whole lot easier than flying there. Without computers to video chat with @CAPS3 grandma, I have no communication with her they one or two times a year. Using a computer for communication is extremly helpful it allows you to do so many things without travelling for, like video chatting. Another reason why computers are a neccessity in our is because reseach for and easier. Many kids nowadays have so much homework and spend on the internet. For I myself, that I. The internet is a quick way to get the reseach. Plus, the research I have found is just as accurate as a book from a library. Computers are absolutly needed when kids have a load of homework and projects that need to be researched. Thinks when the time a to, kids have to type up essays and prompts that its unimaginable. Just in the @DATE1 I had to type on english, essay and a fluently paragraph. Final grade @CAPS2 I did not type it, on a computer. Typing things on the computer cames out of school also, whole @CAPS3 dad is frequently typing up and he is also typing up essays for his company. Many things nowadays in order to be perfect, have to be written up on the computer or you will not get the result you were hoping for. In conclusion, computers are modern devices and you are going to have to live with it. Computers provide great communication with everyone around or even across the country. Also, they make research for school become a lot more efficent. Finally, computers type papers and essays up faster. Computers are a neccessity for living."	4	4		8																					
515	1	"Dear, local newpaper @CAPS1 it's true technology is blinding everyone. More and more people are being sucked into electronics and less people are caring about our planet. Their are so many great things out there that could be put at risk. People @MONTH1 say that if you spend allot of time on the computer they would be able to find cure's for the deseases out there. Those are just lies to stay lasy and waste their life on the computer. What is going to happen to all of the sports in the world. The players are going to get old and they will retire and if no one is going to take their place then the games would be cancled. I am a big fan of football and I don't want to see it ge cancled. Some of my friends are saying they are addicted to the computer and I always hope they get out of that habit because what's going to happen when they get older they are going to need a @CAPS2. If they stay addicted they won't want a @CAPS2 and they what they won't have money, they can't pay bills, and they would lose their house. Why do people say they could find cures for things by looking on the computer we all know that's not true. They need to learn about them first not by just looking on the computer. They @MONTH1 not want to but they would have to look in books and do some heavey thinking before they can find the cures. I hope the ways of life change really fast because things can get really bad. If we do stop this way of life then things could get better and then our planet @CAPS3 will stay around longer and we could make the a better place."	4	4		8																					
528	1	"Dear newspaper editor, I think computer are a benefit to everyone. My first reason why I think computers are abenefit is because if you don't know about somthing and you wana learn more about it, you can just go on the computer and do some research on it. The best part is you can research anything even if its like a million miles away. The internet has imformation on anything and every thing. my second reason why, is because if you have a webcam and some of your relatives live very far away you can see them when ever you want. Its not just webcam either you can also go on facebook and other sites like that to talk to family and friends and see pictures of one another. my last and final reason is that you can do almost anything on a computer. Their software on them to write, do projects, and plan things oct. plus most of the modern day society uses computers for stores and business's to keep track of things. Well thats why I think computers benefit us. I told you why I thought they did and how."	3	3		6																					
531	1	"Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 opinion on computers @MONTH1 be the same as others or different. I believe that computers help our society. They give us more knowledge on whatever subject we want, it helps us connect to family far away places and they even give us a better understanding of any place we can't see for ourselves. Some people feel that computers distract kids so they're never spending time with family. But what if one of your family members is on the other side of the world? @CAPS1 cousin lives in @LOCATION2 and the only way I can ever talk to him is through a computer. What if your a little kid and your mom or did go on business trips faraway for a very long time? You would use a computer to talk to them wouldn't you? Not everyone in your is always around you and when someone is faraway a computer is the way to connect. Because of computers kids don't exercise. What if your exercise happened to be hiking? In you get exercise and can expose the scenery. With a computer you can explore anywhere without even leaving your doorstep. Say your just a young kid and you're always located to see @LOCATION1 but you can never go there. What would you do? You would hop on a computer and check it out. You can explore any place you want with the click of a button. In school you learn about very historic people who have been dead for thousands of years. How would you learn more about them if they're gone? A computer has information about anyone you chance. You @MONTH1 not be exercising but you're expanding your knowledge aren't you. Yes you could go down to a library and take out a book on the person. However, what if the book doesn't have the information you are looking for? You could end up reading for hours when the certain information you want wasn't even there. A computer gives you anything you need in a matter of seconds. Why waste your time? Now is the time where our technology advances. Why waste your time on something when you've got what you need right at your fingertips? So what are you waiting for? Go learn what you want right now! Haven't seen your cousin in a long time? Start up your computer and get talking. The time is now!"	4	6		10																					
532	1	"Dear Local newpaper editor, I think computers benefits us in a good way. Weither computers are helping kids with research for homework, projects and essays or building online stocks to help make buisness grow. Computers are now a benificial way of life. We can see what happens on the other side of the world. And learn about new things everyday. What I think people are focusing is what they thikn computers are doing to people, but are really not focusing on how it helps us in so many ways. One way that people say computers effects people is that we don't exercise instead were attached to our computers. I doubt computers do this not everyone likes or wants to exercise. And why would computers stop people from doing that. It's people choice, the computer doesn't forces them to stay in the house. And computers are a great way for you to catch up with friends and family. It could be online chatting and even sharing photos. And I highly doubt people stop seeing their fmailies because of computers it just doesn't make any sense. People who are against computer are giving people in chairs or controlling them, it's just silly. If people acually stopped to take the time and think; theirs a chance that they would see how computers has helped us grow as a nation. And how much they used computers and that it really helped them than just searching through books for a ton of information. As years have gone by I could see that a ton of thinhs are runed by computers and that alot of people use them. And it has impacted our country, in my opinion a good way. And if it wasn't for computers who knows how are nation would be running. And if computers amde such a posotive impact on our country already I can only iamgine the years to come as computers become bigger and better. So as you have read I gave mt reason as how think computers impact our lives. And how I think the years to come it will impact our lives bigger and better. Now I can't force you to be for, or against computers bbut what ever your opinion is just think of a world without computers especially if you grew up with them."	4	4		8

There are dozens @ORGANIZATION1 practical for computers but nowadays, many people, especially children, are using computers excessively. This unnecessary usage @ORGANIZATION1 computers can cause obesity, expose children to mappropriate things & destroy family time. Readers, hear my arguement and by the end @ORGANIZATION1 the paper you will surely agree with me that computers are detrimental to society. Have you ever made a @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1's @CAPS2 to lose weight? It's not uncommon for one to make such a goal. According to the @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 adults make their @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1's @CAPS2 to get in shape, exercise nore or just lose weight.

There are also plenty @ORGANIZATION1 entrepenuers out there that want to convince you to buy their exercise product @CAPS7 you can develop outrageously large muscles in ""no time at all"".

They found that the group who from computer use lost nearly @PERCENT2 more weight on average them the group on the comercial diet! Nothing is causing obesity in @LOCATION2 them computer. A familier day for an average child in @LOCATION2 goes like this: go to school, home on the bus, use computer eat dinner, do homework, go to bed. Unfotunately, these happens @NUM1 days a week & the computer time is eating up none other than the exercise time. Readers please, try avoiding you computers for just one week, and you can forget those jet plane. Another negative @ORGANIZATION1 computers is that it not only affects an individual but possildy an entire family! Many children can go an entire day without sitting down & talking to their parents. My friend @PERSON1 often hope from school and goes straight up to to use his laptop without even saying hello to his parents. Computers have become nearly an addiction to most teenagers. @PERCENT3 @ORGANIZATION1 teens in @LOCATION2 say they use computers daily & @PERCENT4 say they have trouble communication with their parents. There is a direct connection between the lack @ORGANIZATION1 communication at home for teens & computer usage. Teens become in their society lives and become to their computers. What they don't notize is that they're totally forgetting about their families! I know I've made the mistake @ORGANIZATION1 becoming too attached to socia networking to remember my family but luckily I have a stable family environment. Some teens don't have that luxury. Computers have the ability to destroy parent-child relationships, don't let that happen to you. Your children are without a doubt, through, the ones a by this technical revolution the most. From the time they were your children probably had a keyboard at their fingertips. Do parents ever realize what they're getting their children into when they teach them how to use a computer though. Children as young as @NUM2 or @NUM3 years old are exposed to profamily, & vulgar pictures on the web on supposed ""safe sides"". Do you even realize who your child's talking to on the computer? With all the @CAPS8's & emails flying around, you could be talking to a complete stranger without-even knowing. An enormous part @ORGANIZATION1 who your child become & the values they hold is a product @ORGANIZATION1 what they were exposed to @ORGANIZATION1 a young age. Bring a computer to your kindergartrer & you can probably guess what they'll grow up with. No matter how much you think or believe on the safety @ORGANIZATION1 computer, you cannot argue with the fact that computer expose children to adult content very early in their lives. @CAPS7 do you look at your computer differently @CAPS6? Faced with the concerns @ORGANIZATION1 lack @ORGANIZATION1 exercise, separation @ORGANIZATION1 families & mappriate natural children do you really want your children, or even you for that matter, using a computer daily. Think a head @NUM4 years from @CAPS6. Will you say ""I wish I used my computer"" or ""I wish I spent more time"". In the end, the choice is really up to you."	6	5		11																					
537	1	"Dear, local Newspaper, I hear that you think computers have an effect on people. Will I disagree with what you say. I think computer will help us learn, and do things faster. Haveing computers helps the community learn more. My first, reason I think we should keep computers because it helps people with there hand eyes coordination for jobs. With the skills of typing you can work at places like the city of @LOCATION1 where they type every day and work hard. They also learn more and more facts about the sociatis. Without knowing how to type you @MONTH1 not get any top class jobs. My second, reason telling us that computers are helpful is that it helps your children do better in school by learning how to type for high school, and learning math, sce, social studies and language arts. Computers also helps kids at young age do math and other with their character, like dora, @ORGANIZATION1, elmo, and others. So learning on computer can help you learn and have fun at the same time. Which i know your parents would like. Even new born babys can learn how to read, write and do math and grow up and can be president one day. My third, reason is that it helps send things all over the world. Without computers we would have to do it old fashion style. Also with computers you can talk to family member that live far away from you (In state or country) and you have not see them in a long time. Or you can chat with old school friends from back in the day. You can also buy thing off the computer. In my conclution I told you that computers can not effect people by telling you that your child can do better learning and parents also. I also add that it helps you get jobs and help you with your hand and eye cordination in school and out. So computer help the community."	4	4		8																					
539	1	"Dear newstimes, I really think that computers are a good thing because they let you talk to people online, they have ways or doing things for other people, and people have to manage alot of there money and hills on the computer. First they let you comunicate with other people, did you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the united states have family in a different state, and never get to see them, well, thats when computers come in handy because computers have a thing calle d vidio chat and thats where if you have a webcam you can talk to peoplem from different places around the world because you can see each other both through the camera, also there is a thing called @CAPS1 and that allows you to talk to people whenever you want if they are online, my mom got a @CAPS1 and now she chatting she hasn't seen since highschool and she is very happy to see her old friends again. secondly computers have away of people, like if you have an emergency you can go to the computer and save it. Like if you have an email you can email then if you have and emergency, there is even a thing on the computer that can call someone or even call all for along emergency. @PERCENT2 of the people in the @LOCATION1 say that a computer has many people think that from a computer. Thirdly computers help people paying there bills and with there mony. Did you know that @PERCENT3 of people in the united states pay there bills on the computer and manage there mony on the computer. I know my parents do and I know a lot of other people that do to, and if we didn't pay our bills then we wouldn't be able to have a home or anything and thats pretty much do need computers because if you didn't have them then people wouldn't have a any mony. In conclusion people really do need computers because people like people that they know and they have helped many people in the united states and lastly computers really help you manage money and bills, and every body should have a computer for all of these very good reasons."	5	4		9																					
540	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of the world say that computers are a good way to interact with people, learn about forgien people and places and also learn about where your family came from. So here I am going to inform you about the good reasons why computers should stay in our society. How do you meet people from different countries? One way is interacting with different people all over the world. I am saying this because the internet has a lot of benifits in meeting people. One way is to make a certain account where you can meet people who aim or a different account. Another way is go on a website where you can pen-pal someone from a different place in the world. The final way is to download something where they can send instant messages to people all over the world. Do you have a project where you to learn about another country or another explorer? Well you can use the computer to learn about the place or the person. I am saying this because that will helps us with all the work we do for school. Computers also help you with your school work by helping you with homework. I am saying this because with nobody home when nobody there when you come home from school who is going to help you with your homework you can use a website that helps you understand the material better. Do you know where your family comes from? A way you can find out with your family come from is use a website to find where your family comes from. For example, @LOCATION1 is a helpful website to learn who they really were in life, were they fight in a war. You can find this all out on the computer. Another way is you can ask your parents the name of someone and type there name in google.com. There are many reasons why we should could keep computers but here are some, interact with people, learn about other places and learn about family. I hope you understand this better."	4	4		8																					
549	1	"Typing and surfing the web @MONTH1 be exciting; however, is it worth the @CAPS1 risks that there are now? Before computers were discovered, human's healthyness is triple than what it is now. Computers can be useful and @MONTH1 have some benefits; on the other hand, they are harmful and they should not be used as often. They have unprofessional websites, they are not helpful when it comes to excercise, and they disturb @CAPS1 individuals privacy. @CAPS1 kids are let onto computers every day and they wonder @ORGANIZATION1 to the websites that the internet has to offer. Consequently, kids end up in inappropriate websites that they are not meant to be on. In fact, @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 kids enter unproffesional websites and @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 them have no parental vision in the @LOCATION1 alone. Therefore, @CAPS1 kids act up in homes and at school. However kids are not the only ones who are affeted by this. Computers have a disadvantage @ORGANIZATION1 being hacked or virused from uncensored websites. MOreover, computers crash or don't allow use @ORGANIZATION1 computer documents because @ORGANIZATION1 these viruses. Ever since the @ORGANIZATION2 was invented obesity and lack @ORGANIZATION1 exercise in a person's schedule has skyrocketed. A scientist, named @PERSON1 from the @ORGANIZATION1, said,""@CAPS1 computers users have lost their use if muscles, but they have gained to over @MONEY1 @ORGANIZATION1 fat causing a lot @ORGANIZATION1 hem to not be able to do activities they did before."" I believe that this is definitely true because I remember that the same happened to my sister. She ate more and her excercise time was spent more on the computer that on her body. I know that @CAPS1 say that computers help in hand-eye coordination, however, is it really worth more than someones healthy body? @CAPS1 things are sold on the internet that are not in stores, but you don't trust the internet when buying these products. You don't trust the internet because you have heard so much about someone'es identify or money taken away from them."	4	4		8																					
550	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are harmfully effecting the children, and they are going to effect @CAPS1 generations even more. Computers are fine in moderation, as are most things. If they are needed for a school project that fine but using the computer everyday rather than exercising is not okay. Supporters of technology say that computers have a positive effect. I have to disagree. They say they practice hand eye coordination, they can teach you about far away places and you can talk with people online. Sports are a great way to exercise and practice hand eye coordination. Tennis, baseball, basketball, hockey, etc are all great sports that practice hand eye coordination. They are much healthier that I.Ming your friends all day. You sit on your butt all day and scream to your mom to get you a drink of water, or some dinner. ""@CAPS1 generations are becoming way to dependant."" says @PERSON1, my @NUM1 grade @CAPS2 teacher. How are you suppose to be able to support a family when your older if you cant get up from the computer. ""@CAPS3 a family is hard work,"" my mom tells me, ""your family needs food which means someone needs a job, and someone also needs to get the food. That takes a lot of time and energy."" I agree with my mom, and if simple things like going outside for an hour a day are practiced as a child, having a job and @CAPS3 a family will be easier. Rather than searching the internet for hous to find a good online source to support your thesis paper go to the library! The internet is a realitively new data basis. However, it has grown so much. You cannot always trust internet sources. People who @MONTH1 have posted the website could very well be crazy. Plus websites are filled with viruses, and what happens when your computer is dead due to viruses and you actually need your computer for a school project? The simple alternative would be going to the local library and checking out a variety of books. The books are trusted and filled with information. The internet is also not a very safe place. Facebook, aim, email, twitter, etc are all ways for people to comunicate through the computer. Facebook, aim and twitter are scary and not safe because you @MONTH1 not know who you are talking to. They do have a profile which you @MONTH1 be able to relate to, but they could be lying. ""The internet is a broad place open to strangers,"" my dad says. I am not allowed to have these ways to comunicate because of the specific reasons that I stated earlier. My parents are doing this to protect me and I agree with their decision. Rather than talking to complete strangers go over to your friends house. Your friends are the people that you want to talk to and spend time with. Overall computers are bizarre pieces of technology that can be unsafe, not truthful, and are forcing children to become more dependent on adults. I have to disagree with the supporters of technology. There are many healthy alternatives to the computer. I believe that experts who are concerned that people are spending to much time on the computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Not only do the alternatives that I stated before keep people safe, they also practice a healthier way of living. It is important to keep your bodies healthy because in the end thats what everyone's goal should be."	6	4		10																					
556	1	"Dear newspaper, Computers are everywhere in our nation. We have them at home, at @ORGANIZATION1 or at our work. Many people believe that computers are bad for our health or we don’t spend enough time with our family. But I disagree. Computers teach hand-eye coordination let us learn about faraway places, and also let us allow to chat online with other people. Have you ever had trouble with hand-eye coordination? Sometimes mine is ridiculous! But when i get on a computer it gets to be much better. Experts say that @PERCENT1 more people with hand-eye coordination have improved by working with computer. A teacher at @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""@CAPS1 students have been working on the computers for about two months now and I have seen an incredible improvement in their hand-eye coordination already."" I agree with these experts too. So many people nowadays that have a computer have passed their hand-eye coordination test! When I grow up and soon get out of high @ORGANIZATION1 I want to travel all over the world. But first I want to be educated on where I go. That is why computers are so helpful. I can just click on a button and the internet will bring me to hundreds of sites where I can learn all about the places I want to visit. @CAPS2 time @CAPS1 parents told me we were going to @LOCATION1 for the day. So the night before I did a bunch of research of different shops, museums, and places to eat. The computer helped me so much that if we didn't have @CAPS2 then i don't know where would go. President @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS2 time when i had a big meeting in @LOCATION3 I had no knowledge about it. So I logged on to the computer and it brought me to a million pages on their culture, language, and much more. I dont know what I would do if I didn't have a computer."" I love talking to @CAPS1 friends. But once I'm home none of @CAPS1 friends are around me, so I have nobody to talk to. If I also don't have the phone available then that makes it even worse.But, if I go on the computer then I can talk to bunch of @CAPS1 friends. I can go onto @CAPS1 webcam to see who I am talking to or I can go onto another website to get an instant message. I love talking online because ont of @CAPS1 best friends in the whole word moved down to @LOCATION2 so I don't get to talk to her too much. But if I go to the instant message website then I can talk to her as much as I want. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people sold in a survey that they have someone they talk to over the internet. So I say the computer is important in our society. It helps complete a number of tasks. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and it even allows people to talk to friends and family online. So I dont think computers are bad fo us or our health. I think they are important and needed."	5	5		10																					
559	1	"Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 a world filled with gargantuan people seated at a moniter, their eyes staring at it blankly. Outside the city streets are deserted, save for the squirils running along fence posts. This is what will happen if people spend to much time on the computers. People will spend less time exercising, less time outdoors enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. This is why computers have a drastic negative affect on people. First of all, people send huge amounts of time on their computers and small amounts of time exercising. In a recent poll done by @ORGANIZATION3 magazine, it stated that @PERCENT1 of people between the ages of @NUM1 and @NUM2 prefer to be online rather than outside exercising. That article also states that since @DATE3, child obesity has increased by @PERCENT2! @PERSON2 of @ORGANIZATION1 at @ORGANIZATION4 states that “ the reason child obesity has increased so much is because children spend so much time in front of the computer and less time outdoors. Do you want this rate to increase in the next ten years? Secondly, spending so much time inside decreases the time you spend outside enjoying nature. Bird watches monthly has had a decrease in subscriptions the @DATE1 because people are not interested in nature anymore. In a study done by @PERSON1 and his collegues at @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 spend almost @PERCENT3 more time indoors infront of electronic devices, most frequently computers, then they do out doors. @PERSON3 says, “@CAPS4 to the new advancements in technology, people are to spend more time indoors than outdoors and that percentage will most likely increase as the decade proceeds”. Finally, spending so much time in front of the computer leaves you less time to interact with family and friends. In @DATE4 more than @PERCENT4 of family ate dinner together now, only @PERCENT5 eat together usually because they are in separate rooms in front of a moniter. This also leads to higher crime rate, believe it or not. Because young children and adolescents don’t have the person to support and guide them because they don’t spend time together @CAPS4 to the frequent use of computers, there is a @PERCENT6 chance that child will commit a crime compared to the @PERCENT7 chance a child would in @DATE5. Do you want that for our youth? Now @CAPS1 a world where people jog together in the park, as they jog, they see a group of bird watchers huddled together under a tree. As the joggers proceed, they come to a pavilion and see a big family celebrating the @DATE2 of a family member. This happy thought won’t become a reality if people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising ,enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. So, local newspaper I encourage you, to encourage others, to get outside and spend less time infront of the computer. You have the power to make a difference in your real lives. But the question is, will you?"	6	6		12																					
561	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that the computer is good for the society because, @CAPS2 and student's do most of the studies online. We spend most of our time with our family and friends so we want a little bit of time to ourselves. We learn much more on the computer because it has a lot of facts. After reading this essay I hope you will agree with my position. @CAPS2 student's put most of their notes on a laptop and study what they did in class on the computer. @CAPS6 they need to look something for history class they have internet. High @CAPS3 @CAPS4 don't like going to the library so they go on the internet as there source. So @CAPS6 a student has a project due and the teacher wants it neat the computer will write the project neatly. The computer/internet has became a big source of learning to our society don't you agree? Our time most of the time is spent with our families @CAPS7 not our friends came over. Go outside and play with them, sit down and play games. Our families we are so little bit of time to ourselves computer won't hurt nobody. We don't on forever we friends or search something useful @CAPS5 we talked to our families @CAPS6 we go online searching for they couldn't fire. People countries to see @CAPS7 enough to visit for @CAPS7 they wanna that country they need a resource that is up to date. A computer is constantly updated with new fact's about everything. I hope after reading this you will agree with my position. Mostly every person has a computer and it does not effect there lives a lot. A computer is a great resource for the public. People wanna meet new people so they use a computer to do so student's want a great grade on those project so they wanna present it nicely. I believe agreeing with you be a very good choice."	4	4		8

A use for computer that is also use full is hand eye coordination. Education is also a useful thing you can use with computers. You can learn about faraway places and monuments. The myth is that computers ruin relationship between friends and family however, In some ways @CAPS1 improves them, when you go on skype you talk with some one online. By doing this you actually improve the bone between you and that person. This information proves that computers can actually suport replationships. Hand eye coordination is also something useful that a computer an teach when you type on keyboard your fingers inprove on reflectsel. If you continue to type your hand eye coordination will improve. Some people might say that a computer won't help you much @CAPS1 really is possitive to use @CAPS1. A computer is more educational than what most people would think. On certain websites you can see something that can teach you. If you go on a historian websites that someone could learn about different typs of people. Lots of critics say that a computer is not educational. However when you look at the facts a computer can teach a lot. @CAPS1 is easy to belive a computer is not a good thing.

I am all for this. Reasons being are lots of kids have friends that they talk to online, secondly kids have homework/projects that they might have to look up online, and my last reason for this is, some family might have @CAPS1 ect, so they can communicate online. My first reason for this is, a lot of kids have friends online that can't text or even talk on the phone, so this is another easier way to talk to them. Did you know that most kids communicate online now. ""I think the internet is a great things, I mean I would rather have my kids online than outside roaring the and getting into troupe."" @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1. @NUM1 of @NUM2 kids are online communicating with others.

I remember the times when I had a project due at school, and I guessed on. that didn't do my grade any good. So then I decided the next time I have a project to do it on the internet. And it worked, I got a much better grade then I did on the one I guessed on. Lastly, mostly everybody has on the internet and would live to and with them while.

Think about how life would be in the @DATE1 without computers. Different, right? I don't think I could have written such a great research paper without the use of a computer. The internet has many helpful sources; such as databases, encyclopedias, and articles. You can find information on almost any topic. The computer makes this easier for us to do. You can just search key words, and you have what you're looking for. Its faster than skimming through twenty books. Once you find what you're looking for, you can paste it into a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 document and print it. It's as easy as that. Another benefit of computers is communication. I have found this important over the last few years. A family that I have been close to my whole life had moved to @LOCATION1 due to jobs. Thanks to internet, I have been able to keep in touch with them. Im sure thousands of other people have been in the same situation. Whether it's on email, @ORGANIZATION1 instant messanger, or facebook, people can communicate with others all around the world. It's more convienent than having to time your phone calls so it's a good time for both of you. If we didn't have this connection with forgein countries, everyone’s lives would be different. Computers haven't just changed personal lives. They change the medical field too. This has greatly benefitted our society. Scientists and doctors find out new discoveries and what advances have been taking place. Doctors use computers to plan and perform surgery procedures. Computers have helped advance and improve the medical research and diagnosis. This saves the lives of many people. @PERCENT1 of tests that have taken place to research a dicsease use a computer of some sort to break it down.

When your on the computer all day everyday your missing out on whats happening with your family you miss out on every thing that's going on.

I think that computers do improve your hand-eye coordination. When you can type fast and accuratly you know your hand eye coordination is doing well. I remeber as a kid I would watch my grandmother type about seventy-five words per minute. Just from her year of practice, she becamr very computer coordinated. My hand-eye coordination is becoming a lot better because I have types for a long time. Scientists say that @PERCENT2 or people that type for at least four years become better hand-eye coordinated typing fast keeps your fingers quick and agile. I once read a book on computers and an expert said ""the invention of the computer keyboard could possibly be the greates hand-eye coordination practice ever."" @CAPS1 plus about computers is that they allow you to learn about far away places wtihout really going there. In school you can do projects on other countries without traveling just by using a computer. I once had to do a class project on @LOCATION1 and got a @PERCENT1 just by using a computer, people can look up information on countries for pleasure too. Mu mom just wanted to learn about @LOCATION2 so she just looked it up on the internet from her computer. You can research schoold too. My older sister went online to bok at collges without acctually traveling to the actual college states. Finally one more thing you can do on a computer is talk to people online. There is such a thing as @CAPS2-mail which allows you to write people over the internet on the computer. I remember when my baseball coach was going to tell me I made the team he just @CAPS2-mailed my parents because it was the most simple way to get it done. There is also such a thing as @CAPS4 (instant messaging) that allows you to imediatly talk to somebody and for them to immidiatly talk to you back. I remeber I used to go on @CAPS4 everyday to talk to friends. Also you can video chat which allows you to directly see somebody and actually talk to them physically. I read a news article on video chatting and an expert said ""video chatting is the single best way to communicate with someone without being right inforn of them talking with them. These reasons are why I think computers are a big help in our society."	4	4		8																					
601	1	"Technology is advancing every day. One main technilogical device that is popular is the computer. More and more people are using them, however, not everyone agrees that it benifits society. I believe that it does benifit us. One reason is that you can explore things at home. Before computers you would have to go to the library, find the book you need, and then search through it until you found the information you needed. Those things alone could take hours, especially if you don't live near on library. However, with computers you could just type it in on a search engine and find what your looking for. That could save you gas money because you don't have to drive anywhere. Another reason is that you can communicate online for free. Without a computer you would either have to go see that person by driving, talking on the phone, or texting, wich are all expensive. On the computer you have e-mail, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and many more. All of them you can communicate in different ways. If you want to look at pictures, take quizes, play games, or talk, thats @CAPS2. And finally for e-mail, you can send people letters videos, or you can just talk to other people by typing like all the others."	4	4		8

617	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, i do not believe that computers benefit society, I feel this way because I have heard that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time doing unproductive things. The main reason why I am against keeping computers around is because the people that use them the most are neglecting their families as well as their friends. The second reason why I am against keeping computers around is because they are too time consuming. Last but not least, I am against keeping computers around because people are spending too much time on the computers and less time exercising. Now, lets talk about the way people are neglecting their families and friends. Computers are very addicting, so I can understand why people would neglect their loved ones for them, though I can understand why certain individuals do it I dont think its right. I have many friends who would rather be on facebook or myspace than hang out with me. The web site listed above can really make you forget about reality. My friends will forget about interacting with any and everyone just to spend time on the computer all day. The reasons listed above tell you why I believe that computers should be taken away because of neglecting purpose. Now, lets talk about all the time that is being consumed by computer users. i believe that time is a very valuable thing and you should not waste it. So when I read about people wasting time on the computer all day I, myself, was very upset! Statistics show that the average teenager spends @NUM1 hours a day on average on the internet, statistics also show that the average aldut spends about @NUM2 @NUM3 hours on the computer a day on average. When I read the above statistics I came to grips with the fact that people spend too much time on the computer doing nothing. Now, lets talk about exercising a bit more. I, myself, know that too much time is being spent on computers. By me knowing that I am aware of the fact that children are not exercising. Exercise is very important for a growing child, and if they are not getting all the exercise that they need it can cause health problems in the future,. Statistics show that around @PERCENT1 of children under @NUM4 years of age are obese. The above reasons tell you why I believe that exercise is more important than spending time on the computer. Now, lets bring this letter to an end."	4	5		9																					
622	1	"Dear @CAPS1, don't you think that nature is better than spending way too much time in the computer? Well, generally speaking, I think it is and i'll give you only three reasons why. First of all, it's about the obesity percentage in @LOCATION1. Second, you can spend a lot more time with your family. Finally, you can enjoy what nature has to offer. I think that the great outdoors is the way to go because @LOCATION1 needs some exercise rather than spending time in the computer. Also because the obesity percentage rate is advancing up really high. In @DATE1, @PERCENT1 are obese or overweighted. Last year in @DATE2, it was @PERCENT2. Wow, the rate went went up like @PERCENT3 in each year. This info was online at www.tomatotalks.org. Another thing I would like to consider, spending more time with a family or even a friend is a good thing. All statistics show that spending time with your family anywhere especially at the dinner table is a great way to talk about your child's problem's in school, and also to learn their parent's mistakes too. Also share great laugh's. Finally the most important thing is what they will do for their future. Last, but not least, you can enjoy the greater outdoors, and also discover some of the most important creatures such as insects, reptiles, and mammals. These creatures are the most important things in our life to learn about. Also trees that gives us oxygen too. Mother nature has it's great benefits when your career is all about science. Computers are educational but nature is better!"	4	4		8																					
631	1	"Dear Newspaper People, I think that the effects that computers have on us are good. You should agree. One reason why you should agree is because computers are like teachers. For example, you can go on websites that teach you all kinds of things like math. Also you can go on cyber school or take college classes online. Another reason why you should agree with me is because on computers we can communicate easier. On computers, you can e-mail and use a webcam to talk to people. You can also have a facebook or myspace to chat and learn more about people. last of all, computers are for our entertainment. On computers, there are lots of games to play that are free. Also online you can watch movies and listen to music. Last, you can have fun creating games and stuff to share with everyone. Without computers we wouldn't be able to do any of those things anymore. I think that it would really suck and tons would agree with me. That is why you should agree with me that we"	3	3		6																					
634	1	Hi do you think that if you use the computers too much then you will not exercis and you will not enjoy the outside nature with talking and playing with your friends and family will do not because computers are need for over needs and one click can help lot of people and can save live and the more advances over technology become. We will all so advances like or help a person look for a need jod and you can still talk or chat with best friends or just your grand mom.

637	1	"Dear, To who it @MONTH1 concer, I am writing this to inform about how the ocmputers benefits society. I think computers aren't that great because people use certain websites. People use @CAPS1 messaging and its also a way getting connected to others. I also think that some people ae addicted because you can search someone or @CAPS5. You find top websites that maybe inapropriate for users who use the computers. Some computers are bad education to some kids who are trying to learn majority of kids use computers for internet access most kids will be on the computer playing games that @MONTH1 not be suitable for the age group. My first reason is when people get on the computer they find websites that others use. For example: @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, ect. Many people use websites to check the emails. For exmaple: @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION1L, @CAPS4.mail, ect. My other reason to you why people use websites is for @CAPS1 messaging. People sue @CAPS1 messaging to connect with their friends, family, & other people they @MONTH1 not know. People say its a faster connection to people @MONTH1 not could reach. For example: person doesn't have a phone, the person does not live close by & the person lives in another town. I also think it good research to browse people. For example you know someone but you can't find you can browse. Another second one is people maybe addicted. For example: they go on website & they go on it over & over & over again. they don't stop using it until it gone. In additional people think it keeps them busy. For example you don't have anything to do go on the computer. Lastly you find top websites that maybe inapropriate for users. For example, you find a website but its not suitable for minor. Only @CAPS5 adults could watch. One more thing computers aren't bad education. For example you can learn from apropriate websites that builds brain muscles. My opinion is that I do think computers benift the society because it mainly helps you brain storm & you get to know websites & learn about them."	4	4		8																					
639	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that people are spending to much time on computers, and I agree because people spend so much time on computers that @CAPS2 gets addicting, people don’t get enough exersize, and eyesite gots worse. So please keep reading my letter and I will tell you the side effects of the computer. Most of all @CAPS2 gets really adicting for a lot of people that they dont spend time with thie familys or sibleings and some kid get so adicted that they come from school and start useing the computer all day and dont study for a test or do home work. Now people spend so much time on the computer that they dont exersize or play sports with thier friends and just sit all day and get lazy and fat just because of the computer. We just need the computer just to chek @CAPS3 and facebook like I do but I just check my facebook and the go play basket ball. One of the biggist problem that I think is when you sit on the computer to long and get a head ache and ruins your ey site. So thank you for reading my letter and hope you agree with me."	3	3		6																					
641	1	"My opinion is that people spend to much time on computers and don’t concentrate on their family. Another reason is that people will not do school work if their to concentrated on the computer. My third reason is people wont enjoy hanging out with there friends. Those are my reasons now let me explain them. First, people will be concentrated on the computer and not their family. They will be focused on the computer way to much and not have fun with there family and friends. People ignore their parents when on computer. I know this because my sister goes on the computer and completely ignores my mom and dad when there talking to her. Please heed my advice or your kids will be ignoring you when you are talking to them. @PERCENT1 of children go on the computer and ignore everything. Now I can advance to the next reason. Second of all, peop concentrate to much on the computer that they dont do homework or any school work. If they dont do homework they could get bad grades on their report cards. If they get bad grades they could fail the marking period and stay back. Please listen or your child could stay back. Now for my third reason. Third, People wont enjoy hanging out with there friends. On the weekends you wouldn't want to be on the computer go out with your friends, enjoy yourself."	4	3		7

First off computers are a positive thing because they can get almost anything done for you. you can play on them, and interact with others the reason that the computer being able to get almost anything done for you @CAPS4 a good thing because if you need to get work done you can do that if you need research @CAPS1 can do that and @CAPS1 can help you In any subject. The reasons that playing games can be positive @CAPS4 @CAPS1 does not only give you great hand eye cordonation but @CAPS1 also exersises you brain and can be a learning for young children.

Its for your own good."	4	5		9																					
647	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that computers benifit the society. Computers help use in many ways but the @NUM1 main reasons are they help us store important documents get better at or learn forein language and get information. So without further adue here is more extensive reasonings. First of all, computers help us store many documents without computers companies that involve autioning and many other thing would have to store everything in filing cabinets. That would take forever and there wouldn't be enough room, so a lot of files would @CAPS1 be laying around every where @CAPS1 think about it. You use computers to make store send your newpaper articles and without computers you wouldn't be able to keep everybody up to date. Secondly they help use learn on get better at forien languages. Computers help use learn what other people are saying in other countries around the world. Like I have grandmother she the learned spanish. Now I can talk to her and she can understand me. Finally computers help use get information. They help us get information for a project at school, records direction, etc. In the year @DATE1 people din't have computers but when the first router was made the people I went up @NUM2 points. Farmers became slaves became very rich and I kid even grad collage at age @NUM3. So before you say people are spending too much fine on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends think about what computers do for us @CAPS1 think. So furher more computers benifit us a lot. There's storing deviced helping us get better a lot learning a forign language and getting information. So please make te right chose and think about what computers do for us. "	6	5		11

Clearly, a life without computers is utter chaos. Computers provide education, and stay in contact with friends and family I'm sure our world greatly benifits from this mericle. Medicine, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 constructing and revolutionizing our life has been made possible by computers. @PERSON1 is an old family friend of mine. He was one of the few people who was working on going to the moon for the very first time. They were astonished with what thier astronauts saw. But computers made the expirience a reality. @PERSON1 remembered recieving some of the first footage of he moon on to his computer, before the photographs and video are released to the public. However, @PERSON1 is not the only person who agrees. Johnson, a principal from a private school in @LOCATION1, after winning an award for best school in @LOCATION1 states @PERCENT1 of our education comes from the computers. We make our students come involved in technology. These are the people who progress to make the best medicine cars and computers.

Also if you are to sick or don'@CAPS1 have time to go out and buy things that you need from stores you can buy it on-line and have it @CAPS7 right to your door. My final reason is that computers can save paper buy having a lot of document on your computer. My first reason was that if you don'@CAPS1 know something you could look it up. A lot of times you could be watching @CAPS1.V. or talking with someone and you @CAPS4 wonder what something is or means. @CAPS6 instead of just letting whatever you didn'@CAPS1 know just pass on you could look it up on a computer and educate yourself and possibly others to.

They had to have this happen @CAPS3 they @CAPS4 worked long hours and they didn'@CAPS1 have the time to go to a grocery @CAPS5 @CAPS6 they had the food @CAPS7 to our house which was a huge help. My last and final reason is that computers can help save a lot of trees and paper. A big thing now is that we have to go green right, @CAPS6 instead of cutting down more trees we can just have all that on our computer which doesn'@CAPS1 we any paper. These are just some of the reasons why computers are a help to society.

If you had to do a project for school about a place outside of the @LOCATION1 the computer would help a lot. You can search what thet wear and what holdays those people celebrate. Learning about people will help you make friends to. if a foreign exchange person comes to your school you can search about their culture and talk to than about it. While using a computer you can also talk to people. With the use of @CAPS1 or A.I.M you can talk to your friends easily. You can ask them what homework you had if you weren't in dschool. You can also become better well friends with people you didn't know that wll, by saying hello, or how was your day. You can also email.

You can go swimming or even have a picnic in your local park. When your outside you can also see all the breathtaking scenery, wild animals, and exotic plants and flowers that live among us. If you just go outside for atleast an hour a day you'll see fore sure how much better it is than being on a computer. Staying on the computer for too long can @CAPS2 you from what realy matters, your friends and family. Why talk on the internet to a friend when you can meet up with them and do something fun?

So has been around for a long time and still is being used everyday and always will be. So would you think that a computer is tacking to much time in a persons day and they are not spending enogh time with family or is it just that compturs are a all natural thing that everybody needs."	4	4		8																					
700	1	"Dear Newspaper; I bileve that computers are good for our society. There are maney resons as to why I beleve this. One reson is that it makes life easior, it also helps us understand what is going on in our lives today. If we didn't have computers how would we talk with people without phones and spred news. Computers make life easior by maney ways. For example, if you needed a docters permition to play a sport, it would be alot easior to send him/her an email telling him/her to send you can email saying you can you can show it to the sports team and they will alow you to play. We can also lirn things about our world today by using the computer. We can go on the internet and go to a news website and look at the wether so we can make plans for the day. We can find the newest technology ""I phone"" or ""@CAPS1 "". There are some people in the world that don't but have a computer. For example, my uncle is in the airfore and the only way we can get to talk to him is through the computer because they don't alow phones. Also if there is a pirson with good news and they want tell a lot of people send an email and forward it to everyone. I hope you understand why I beleve computers are a good thing to have in new society. I have that they make life easyor. It also helps us understand our life today and it helps us talk to people around the world. I hope you agree on my topic."	4	4		8																					
701	1	"@ORGANIZATION2, Technology has developed majorly these past decades. It has helped mankind so much from buildings to new inventions. These is how ever a growing concern about whether it's beneficital or not? People become more lazier because of the many things you could do with it. I think that it benefits us all. We have learned many things from it. The computer shows what man kind is capable of doing. We can learn about many cultures with it. Students use it for studying and making projects look better. I asked @CAPS1 @PERSON3 of @ORGANIZATION1 about the concren. He says that is can expand our knowledge. There is concern about how much paper we lose every year. With computers it makes going green more possible. You can make powerpoints on the computers instead of using so much paper for long essay. We could do tests on computers. I think the future will be based everything on computers. You can email instead of using letters. For example my friend @PERSON2 said her school didn't use paper and uses computers. They saved money and paper because of powerpoints etc. I miss my family over at @LOCATION1. I want to see them. Not just by talking on the phone. I use the computer to talk to them basically have. I asked @NUM1 people if they perfer using computer to talk to there family or use a phone. @NUM2 out of @NUM1 said they perfer computer. I know I'm trying to they are great but they do have there down side. The games are horrible for the computer. People will just play and play all day long. Online for the games make it even more fun thus it make them lazier. There are so many games for the computer it's horrible says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION3. In conclusion, computers will be something that will help us for a long time and it benefits us. Except the fact about the games I agree with that bad side. I hope I have shown you as an independent person my statement was true."	4	4		8																					
704	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I thick this is a good idea because you can play games and talk to family or frends and lisen to music. My first reason is playing games. When you are bored and theres nothing to do all you can do is go on the computer and play all kinds of games like cars, shoting, arcade games to. You can do all this if you are bored or if you just want to go on the computer. My seacond reason is talking to freinds or famiely. If your brother or sister or any of your family members live in a different state and you want to talk to them or see them then all you got to do is ask them ""@CAPS2 is your email address and then if they got a myspace or facebook then you could talk to them as long as you want. You can also talk to your friends on those websites to. My thied reason is lisening to music. You can also lison music on your computer bu going to @CAPS3 or downloading frostwire or something like that. You can lison to all kinds of music like hip-hop, rap rock, or havey rock. If you want to lison to any song your going to need the song's name and something the artistes name to. This @CAPS2 I thinck they should put and @CAPS2 they should pick."	3	4		7																					
705	1	"What is more fun, stairing at a blank computer screen all day, or spending the day out in beutifull nature with your friends and family? Well, if you don't know, I do. I took a survey at my school with the same exact question and @PERCENT2 of the kids said that hanging out with friends and family is much more than spending all of your time on the computer, and there are three reasons why they said that. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, than in person. Next it's unhealthy, and lastly alot of bad things can happen on the internet. So, if you are interested in this topic please keep on reading and I will prove that the computer is not a good way to spend your spair time. Do you know what computers were intended to do? Computers were you people, but have for one second that instead of interacting with people you should interact with the people around you. Instead of going on facebook/myspace to talk to your friends, just them over. If you do that its not only more fun, healthier for you. So next time anything else just think the other options. In my last paragraph didnt I say that hanging out with friends is much more healthier then being? Well I was absolutly @PERCENT1! Did you know that when you waist your only hurting yourself? Well, you are when all your doing is sitting down stairing at a screen you are not doing anything to help your self because you are get absolutly exercise. When your not on the computer at least walking a little bit, but typeing doesnt do anything for you. Thats why people shouldn't spend all of their time on the computer. Have you ever heard of an internet preditor? Well if you let me just sum it up for you. An internet preditor is someone that uses the computer to get people they dont know do inapropriate things. And did I say it was against the law, because it is. So if you you ignore friend because if you dont, bad things. And tahts just one of the reasons why people spend as much time on the computer. So, now you know why people shouldnt spend as much time on the computer as they usually do. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, go in person. Next, it's unhealthy, and lastly, internet preditors. So the next time you open your laptop, just think is it more fun stairing at a blank computer screen or spending the day in beutifall nature with friends and family? And always remember what the is."	4	4		8																					
711	1	"Dear editor, Have you ever stopped and asked yourself which was more important? Of course I can be talking about anything, but what about computers verses family, friends, nature, your own health etc. Well, I ask myself that quite often, and I feel that it's so much more worth it to be with family and friends than to be infront of a computer. There is so much more that I can tell you, and just after my very first reason how could there even be another side to it? Why is it that now these days kids can't simply run out to the bus stop without feeling totally winded? I feel it's because they are not getting enough well needed exercise! For example, instead of sitting infront of the computer, kids, and even adults can enjoy going to the gym. Also, children can get more involved with school sports so they can not only be participating in sports, but they can be involed with school too! Lastly, just by going for a short walk with your dog, your not only walking and getting well needed exercise, your bonding with your loyal friend. Have you ever been gazing out the car window when you just found yourself being sucked into all the beauty that nature has to offer? Well, if you have I guess you could never have too much, but if you haven't, its probably because your spending way too much time on the computer! There are so many different ways that people could learn to appreshiate nature more, such as sitting on a park bench in the @TIME1, while absorbing the fresh air and sunlight. Or you could go for a slow, realaxing bike ride through a trail with a constant cool breeze, brushing your face with every of your wheels. Finally, you could pick a warm day to sit out on the beach, and listen to some music, next to the salty ocean. How could you resist those temptations? Lastly, I believe that family is the most important thing to missing out on! Without family and friends you miss out on so many good ethics and experiences. You lose out on having good lifetime realationships, and how could you turn dow the offer to be with the people you love? In conclusion, I feel that computer are taking away most of the things that no one deserves to live without. I mean, how could anyone live without family, friends, the beauty of nature, and your own health? That is why everyone should make the right desition to take reasponcible charge of their life, and the same question, which is more important?"	5	5		10																					
714	1	"How much of your free time daily to you spend on the computer? It is proven that people too to fifteen years old spend an average of @NUM1 - @NUM2 hours of their free time on a computer. People age sixteen to forty-eight spend @NUM1 - @NUM4 hours of free time daily on their computer. Too much time on the computer can interfere with physical activities, social time, and health issues. Computers have some good advantages here and there but mostly result in a negative effect. In this post decade, the percentage of exercise was gone down and computer bills have gone up. Americans have now spent most of the time web surfing, playing online games, and interacting with online chat rooms. After school, kids go home and turn their computer on instead of going outside running and playing. More people across the country have gained weight due to unhealthy food and no physical exercise. Many local sports have lost teammates due to lack of desire for physical activities because of computers. Many people have stopped going out with friends and family due to going on the computer. The that runs through @CAPS1 minds these days is 'why go out to talk to my friends, when I can talk them online?' I think the opposite. Get out of the gloomy house and go out to see my friends. I don't even go online within every days. I check online for homework and in online shopping twenty minutes. Computers have a major effect on social lives like going out and being confident to meet new people. Lastly, health issues are raising rapidly! The reason we now have shows on @CAPS2 about people with weight and health problems can relate very much so back to the negative effect on people. Like @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and the obese have shown how people gain weight. I think at least @PERCENT1 of these people spend to much time on the computer and not exercising. Eating @PERSON1's then goint home to play online games will definately increase health issues like weight, organs being unhealthy, muscles not functioning properly, and eye and brain damage from starring at a mouse and screen nonstop. People should stop spending so much time on the computer and get outside or get active because computer use does have a negative effect. It interferes with social time, health, and physical activities. Get up and prevent the negative effects of computers."	4	5		9																					
722	1	"Dear @CAPS1 in @CAPS2, Computers are one of the world's best discoveries today. For one, they help in our educational processes. They also help connect people from all over the world in little time and are a neccesity in science research. Overall, computers are the best thing that has ever happened to mankind. First and foremost our children today are already struggling in their educational systems. But with new computers they strive to meet every goal. Teachers cannot tell them everything but computers can, underneath that hard drive is a wealth of knowledge awaiting to be saked up by eager minds. Also, in todays world, waiting is almost non-existant. Learning to type gives these children better opportunities for success in later life. Family, say your child is out @NUM1 school day. Normally, they would miss their homework. But now, they can check it online and get back to their crucial studies when they are feeling better unless you want to risk tommorow's future workforce, computers are in essential tool for us, and our children. One of the best things a lot this world is that we're all different, connecting with each other helps us learn how to tell with each other and move forward as a society. Conneticing through the internet through programs like @ORGANIZATION1 is important for buissnesses as it helps them make decisions faster will ultimatly effect us. But don't be fooled. It can also befor pleasure, say @CAPS3'son & buissness trip in @LOCATION1. No problem. Just go on webcam with him and you don't have to miss him anymore. In the government, problems evolve quickly, and steathily. To solve this, a president can quickly connect to his/her advisors while still being in his/her office. Connecting people through computers is maraculous, and important to life as we know it. In addition, we wouldn't be were we are in science if it wasn't for computers. First of all, we are making great strides with cancer research to day, than estatic common computer. If it wasn't for that, we might not even have kemotherapy. Lets face it, computers are faster then us; way faster. But this is a god thing, because faster proccesing means faster research. While a simple machine @MONTH1 not tell us the cure through its proccesing speed. It certainly brings us a lot closer to unraveling the mysteries certain diseases shold beneath. Two minds are better than one. Even a scientist can not know everything. But while connecting through a computer to scientists all over the world, they can analize research, and make very informed, responsible decisions. Certainly that will extend our life exsentency, and who doesn't want you've larger's some people say that people are too glued to their computer screens. But bear in mind, these are the people helping you stay alive, and helping lower your heathcare bill yoour talking about. So when you get ill and they find a cure, why don't you still compain that they only found it because they were attached to their keyboards and monitors! Trust them, they know what they are doing. So can we come to an agreement life? Computers only do good things, like enhance our youth's advention, connect our and help us find cures for the most malignant diseases and illnesses in the world. So help the world help you, and go promote the use of computers across your community. It will only further advance us as a society in the end."	5	5		10																					
727	1	"Dear Newspaper, I think that the effects are okay as long as we get off the computers and go outside and see some friends and get some exercise. Computers let us not just talk to each other but it also lets us challenge each other on games without hurting each other it could even stop all ways all at once because we could challenge other countries in war games without killing real living people. We can check our taxes and stocks. It also makes it easier to find health insurance, car insurance, and house insurance. We can look up historical facts on the computer. We can look up how to stop snake venom from getting to your heart and how to make a how and some arrows to hurt with. You can find plumbers, technicians, oil companies, and lumber companies. you can find dates on the computer, too and find information about certain eople too."	3	3		6																					
729	1	"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are a great thing to have. For instance they are entertaining, they have communication, and they help make designs. My first reason is that computer are entertaning. I hate to go look at nature. But I love to play videogames on my computer. I still get my exercise though, because I go out and play basketball then play on my computer. The computers are still a good thing though because after @CAPS1 done with basketball, hanging out with friends, or if its raining I like to play some good old gun blasting computer games. My second reason is that you can comunicate with computers. I love to talk to my friends on facebook. You can just login and talk to anyone in the world. There is also video chat you can actually see someone who is talking to you from anywere. Plus email is great for work. You can send information from one computers to the other. My last reason is for designs every modern car that you drive, is originally from a computer. People get on these computers and make blue print designs to make cars. These are my reasons that computers are good."	3	4		7																					
732	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I do not think people use the computer to much. I think this because some use them for work, some use them for school, and some use it to talk to family or friends that are not so close to them. Firstly, most buinesses need computers to keep the buisnesses up and running. Like were my mom works she needs the computer for pay roll, inventory, e-mailing the works about jobs, and to look up companies to supply concrete, stone, tricks, etc. Buisness people have excuses to have to use computers all the time. Most buisness people also use computers to plan buisness trips. Secondly, kids in school use computers to do homework, class work, research for projects, or to go and study island and education. Some kids can choose to use the computers improperly but at the same time interesting. Like how cells divide into smaller cells how body systems work or how a girl or boy is made from embrio to birth. In addition, most people use computers. Like @CAPS2 people use @CAPS2 to talk to on the other side of the world or you can use aim. I have both cell phone to call and text people that live far away. I use aim to talk to all my friends, I use to face with. So, don't say all people are on the computer to much and for the wrong reasons, because that is not true at all. Finally, altho all people are always on the computer it is must likely to talk to friends you haven't seen in a while or for work issues, and for school related work. In my opinion all people will always use the computer because it is the way of life now a days. So, I don't think there are any affects on anyone because we all use it to our benifits."	4	5		9																					
739	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I'm writing to you today about computers I believe that computers can teach you things such as, hand-eye coordination and how that, can open job doors for you. Also you can socialize as well as study with this device. My first reason being socialization. i think that this is a good way to socialize due to the many options. one example would be facebook. This is a social website that is used to connect or reconnect with friends. in a recent poll @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say that computers had made them more social. Lastly, computers are a good way to socialize because of the range it can travel. You can talk to people without the long distance fees of . This can range from the @CAPS2.S to hungary in seconds. My second reason would be that computers are useful in studies. I would say this because even though books are good they use hard to find. With the computer you can access multiple sites. This being you can from wikipedia all the way to the infamous google in just . Another reason I believe computers are good for studies in that you have endless. you will get a the . The lost . My third and final reason is computer give you exceptional hand-eye coordination can because I know accountant. i asked him, ""@CAPS3 did you take that accounting job?"", and he answered, ""They only took me because I have good hand-eye coordination."" @CAPS4 thats one job exemple, another would be real state. Due to computers multiple options you can look up because in the your client. With good hand-eye, however, you can be more efficiecnt with your work. This could help you lead competition, thus, making you more money. This then ends my essay. Stating with socialization, skipping down to studies and ending right on jobs and and bye's front steps. These are only @NUM3 of the many bountiful things that a computer can do. @CAPS1 I hope you read this with my regards."	5	4		9																					
748	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, I would like to tell you computers are very helpful in our society today. Have you ever needed to know something about a state or a place that brought up nig news & you needed to get it? Were did you turn to? I know not a book, but to the computer. Without it how were you going to get your info. I think computers are benefitial to our society because it can help you learn and it could tell you when or where to sign up for activities. People interact with others different countries, states, & or continents. Next, is how computer could benefit our society. Computers could help us learn by searching up research for a paper or even expanding our general knowledge. For instance today my class & I are going to the @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1 to look up info on seat belts on buses. Without computers my class & I couldn't have get it done without the computers. If we had books, it wouldn't have been enough to give to us all & that would mean we would have to share. With sharing some kids @MONTH1 have hogged the books for a long time not allowing the other kid to get the info needed to do the paper, which would lead to a civil dispute in the classroom those two. With computers we have enough for each kid in the class. And, computers could help with gaining more general knowledge quicker. With gaining more general knowledge you become smarter. Next, computer can help set up activities. Computers could help go sign up for activities like baseball, football, basketball, or a gym. With the help from the computers you don't waste time going to the gym signing up, while you could do it at home. Maybe there's a waiting list to enter. You would've known that if you signed up online. For instance my little brother plays baseball & my parents signed him up online. All they had to do was to take him to the place to sign up & show that. I live in the town of @LOCATION1, while others had to sihn up, register, & pay. All of that could've been done online like my parents didnt with the understanding of why computers could be helpful to society by being able to gain knowledge & able to sign up for activities. Do you see why we need them for everyday life or just to get around? Computers are benefitial to our new up & coming society!"	4	4		8																					
762	1	"Computers. They are an amazing marvel of science that greatly benefits man-kind today. But computers can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Homework can be made easier, connecting with others is easier, and entertainment like @CAPS1 and video games are a click away. On the otherhand, Computers can be distracting, addicting, and tiring. It is important to know the pros and cons of computers. For example, the search engine, @ORGANIZATION1, is an easy to use website that can be very helpful. If there is a concept or problem that you are having trouble with, just type it into @ORGANIZATION1 and links to websites pop up that will help answer anything that you would like to know. There is also a website called @LOCATION1. This website is an all purpose dictinary, @CAPS2, encyclopedia and translator. I even have an application for it on my cellphone. But technology can also be distracting. Social networking websites, like facebook, games websites like @CAPS3, and also websites like @CAPS4 can be very tempting and distracting when you should be doing homework. Procrasination is very easy to give into. But self control is the only way to avoid this problem. Budgeting your time so that you can do both your homework, and go on the computer is also very important. One thing that I find very useful on computers is an online textbook. We are lucky enough today that most large books can be formated onto a computer. Instead of carrying a @NUM1-pound text book, you can just use a @NUM1 megabyte book on the internet. This makes travel to and from school much easier. That, and textbooks often use up a lot of desk space, but all you nneed is the space that a computer will consume anyway. Studying is also made easier this way. All of the things that a computer can do are great. But this can also keep us from going outside, excersising, and seing real people in real life. This need for the computer can be bad. We are too connected as a society. Our status, feelings, friends, and position in life are always needing to be updated. Distractions are everywhere. Facebook, for instance, is very addicting. You are looking at a virtual landsacape. Self control really is the only way to get off the computer and step into the real world. Overall, computers are great, but you have to know when, and how long to use it. It has several benefits such as entertainment, communication, and information. But all of these things can be just as distracting as they can be helpful. Knowing this. I hope that society can think of the pros and cons of the computer."	5	5		10																					
764	1	"Dear local Newspaper, To my understanding computers have been putting a bad effect on people of all ages. In my opinion staying on the computer all day can cause you to miss out on outdoor activities. Also if you sit on a chair all day, honestly what will happen to you? You will become less active. In past experiences I have learned that if you get interested in computer game it will come very addicting. Computer put negative affects on people of all and I think we should stop and think about what we are doing. Most likely if you stay on the computer all day you will indeed on activities such as sports. @CAPS2 example @PERCENT1 of americans play soccer. In the beatiful fall when the leaves are beatifully changing you will miss out on playing soccer and the beaty of the leaves because of the computer you can't get your eyes off of. Another breathtaking adventure that you @MONTH1 miss out on is hiking. Hiking can be amazing when you get to the top and you see on the houses that have people like you (cach potatoes) sitting inside on the computer. Simple activities can be lost because of an addicting game you call fun. The computer is like a cause and effect. You @MONTH1 think you just playing farm town or chating on facebook, but in feture you will be missing out on the beauty of nature and sports. To connect @CAPS1's with missing out on sports because of the computer that will cause you to become over weight. A recent study showed that @PERCENT2 of children are obeased because of computer games. You @MONTH1 be thinking how, but I have a friend named named, @PERSON1 and he used to love to play out side and play sports until came out @CAPS2 the computer. Now he way @NUM1 pounds and he is only @NUM2. Honestly sitting in a chair all day will cause you to not be active and gain weight. Do you want this to happen to you? Help me tell others how computers cause a negative effect on others. Lastly playing on the compter or chatting with friends on @ORGANIZATION1 can cause you to @CAPS2 example if your talking to your girlfriend in spain who is there @CAPS2 callage I garentee your going to put off school work, @CAPS3 and other @CAPS4 that need to be done. In the end it will end up being time @CAPS2 bed and you got nothing done weather it was because you were trying to get to level @NUM3 or talking with your girlfriend you will have nothing accomplished. If your not yet a resent scientific study reported that six hours on the computer per day @CAPS2 one week can @CAPS5 your vision from a @NUM4 @NUM4 to @NUM6 @NUM6. If you keep it up now it @MONTH1 not seem bad but @NUM8 hours looking at the computer can kill your eyes. Would you rather be blind or not use the computer because or what could happen? All in all the computer is a bad thing such as useful piece of technology can cause you to miss out on events such as sports. Also it leads to being overweight sense your not getting active. Finally the computer is bad @CAPS2 your eyes and can cause you to procastonate. Help me help yourself avoid all of these bad effects caused from the computer."	5	4		9																					
771	1	"Computers are very important, I don’t know anyone who does not need one. But some people say that it distracts you from exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friend. Do I agree? No I disagree with this situation because computers are a modern day tech that people use. They say it distracts you from interacting with family and friends but a computer is the number one way to talk to long distance friends and family, @CAPS1 without a computer how will those people who work for a business work, and last we always need a computer for research. A computer grabs attention to a lot of teenager. Most of the sites we use due to interacting with family and friends. The two main sites people use is myspace and facebook everyone must know these two sites nine out of ten people use it to interact just think if we did not have a computer we would not be able to interact with our long distance friends and family. My aunt has a facebook and her friends live in @CAPS2 she interacts with them all the time they @CAPS1 have phones but comp. have webcames so you can see the person too. Business people need computer a lot of course mobile computers thats why they have laptops. But as I was saying what will people do with out a computer for work they have your schedules, your notification your boss sent out and much more on the weeks most people work and the weekends we can go visit our family membere there are mosly days in a week and a job pay of course you need a computer. Google is the number one searching website we have. If you want to know what time a movie starts most likely you will go to search on the computer, if you have a research paper due of course you will use the computer. We need the computer for everything if I were to ask my dad what the square root of pie is he would tell me google it. This is one of the main thin people do when they us a computer to research. So if you! Yeah I said you think a comp. is a waist of breath think again because it helps you to communicate with your friends. A lot of business people need it to work and last it is a good research engine. But here is a little advice dont spend all!! Day on the computer pick up your walking shoes to get some fresh air you have all day on the computer just go out and enjoy your self in any way possible."	5	4		9																					
775	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 that use computers is a good thing. I state this because the web has many things to do. For example, facebook, twitter, and myspace are all social sites. Also there are video sites such as youtube. Plus @CAPS1 learn how to type fast. Social network sites are good for @CAPS1. Teens got to talk to each other, make new friends, and post what they want. For example, twitter you can post tweets, facebook you can join groups, and become a fan of something or someone, and myspace you can send messages. TEENS relieve a lot of stress on the web. Videos are great when your bored. Type in youtube and get a good laugh or two. Teens that go on youtube become more social. For example, teens can learn the new dance. Plus on video sites there are comedy. Comedy helps daily life. @CAPS2 helps life if you work in a office or a trademark. Teens learn to type to make life easier. For example @CAPS2 fast is like texting. @CAPS2 is like writing a letter electronically. So get to @CAPS2. Ok so computers do help life in teen years. Basically it is @CAPS3 somewhat. All people should have a computer. Just remember that social sites, video sites, and @CAPS2 make life better."	3	4		7																					
780	1	"More and more people are using computers on a daily basis, but I do not agree that this benefits our society. People are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising and healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with family and friends. As people use computers more they are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Profesor @PERSON1 has done a study showing that people who are on the computer for more than @NUM1 hrs a day are overweight and do not excersise regularly. He goes on the state that if these habits continue throughout their lives they will become obeast and are more likely to die from a heart attack before age @NUM2. I have experienced changes in my communities health due to computers as well, last year I had a friend who weighed @NUM3 lbs and exercised regularly but when he got a computer that folowing year he stopped exercising and gamed over @NUM4 lbs he now is much slower and can not do more than push ups. I do not agree that computers are benefiting our society because as people use computers more they exercise less causing them to be unhealthy. Not only do computers less on unhealthy life style, it also causes spend less time with family and friends. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of children that their our computer spend less time with their family and more time on the computer. This @MONTH1 not seem like a thing at but this study also shows that @PERCENT2 children who spend less time with their familieis grow up to become lonely and kill themselves due to depresion. I remember when a new came to our school from he wasn't that kid and didn't many friends he was still doing just fun but when he came back the next year started and I found out he had at the end of he school and keep in touch with an of his friend and to his parents. So far that week of from the rest of the students and don't much. Then the we got back the @DATE1 he wasn't at school and for the rest of the week he didn't show up either and finaly on @DATE2 and teachers told us he ran away from and has still not been found. So people that use computers are spending less time with their family and friends which can cause them to become depressed and lonely. More and more people are using computers daily basis, but I do not agree that this is benefiting our society. People are spending to much in their computers and are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with their family and friends. I know that the more people using computers is not better for our society it is worse."	5	4		9																					
789	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 stand on this hole computers thing is that it is becoming a big issues because people are spending all there time in books instead of comuitateing with friends and family, exercising, or injoying nature. Just like the expert then tinker siad in his book called @CAPS2 by computers ""To much time on the computers and not the rackemed saven hours outsiad can make you very wnight."" @CAPS3 @CAPS4 why people should get out more is @CAPS5 they can have coumite shion with friends and family. I bet you did not know that @PERCENT1 of kids from @NUM1 to @NUM2 are siting on thier cowth or play vite games as we. Another @CAPS4 is that people need more exercis. more the @NUM3 of the leading of the country will be abeast due litle exercise, and that is mostly because of computers.And the last @CAPS4, and the most importint as well, is @CAPS5 people can injoy nature at its fullist, blivie it or not but jack cup thinks @CAPS5 too he said '@PERCENT2 of people how injoy nature will @NUM4 years longer and people now not will likely have a heart in there @NUM5's"" @CAPS5 that is why I think computers are bad for people but it is not just me it is @PERSON1, jackup @CAPS6, sisintsits, and many percentages as well."	3	4		7																					
804	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, The effects computers have an people are not good. They can cause many problems in your life. When your on a computer, are you running? No, your just sitting there; using the computer involves very little movement. You need to be jumping around, dancing, walking with your friends, something! You can gain a lot of weight by sitting down and using the computer all day. Another problem that computers give you is being non social. You can get addicted to a game or something like facebook/@CAPS1 and be on there all the time. You wont talk to your friends as much at school or hang out with them because all you want to do is go on the computer. You are always thinking about just that and no other things in life. Computers can also be very dangerous. If you are on something where you are talking to people you don't know, they can find out things about you and can do to you. It's not at all to talk to people you don't know online. These are or the many problems computers cause. Trust me, I got addicted to a game before."	4	4		8																					
805	1	"School, family, and sports is @CAPS5 my always tells me. Kids now a days live on the computer. @PERCENT1 of students get out of school and go straight to the computer. Students should spend more time with their families, they should exercise more, and lastly focus more on their grades in school. My initial reason why I agree is because most kids never spend time with their families. All kids like to came home and sit on the computer all day. This is terrible because kids never get to spend time with family and do not show appreciation for @CAPS5 their parents do for them. For example I just want to ask young kids do they thank their parents everyday? The reason I want to ask that is because they should be doing that everyday. In addition my second reason on why I agree is because students need to put more time and effort into school. Kids need to stop spending hours on facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Instead of going on those websites they should be on a website such as @ORGANIZATION1 do research. @PERCENT2 of students that go to school either have facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. For example everyday I walk the halls I over hear students talking about @CAPS5 happen of the computer @TIME1. It's ridiculous how many student do not complet their homework and hand it in late. Lastly my third and final reason on why I agree is because student absolutely do not exercise. A famous baseball player once said ""you don not have to be strong, but you have to be fit and athletic."" @CAPS5 this meant was that you had to be in shape. @PERCENT3 of students are not at their weight they should be at because they are obeast and do not exercise. The only exercise students get now a days is their @CAPS6.E. class. Even then students get tired quick and get out of breathe because they are lazy and always on the computer. They need to get off the computer and do push ups, sit ups, and just exercise. For example everyday I get out of school I do my homework and I go run a mile. To add on to the students need to pass there @CAPS6.E. class. In conclusion students should not spend so many hours on the computer and spend time with their family, as well as focusing on their school grades, and lastly they need to get off the computer and exercise more and stay healthy!"	4	5		9																					
807	1	"Computers. An achievement @MONEY1 technology and science that improve all @MONEY1 our lives. They let you explore the world in one click and chat with your friends. What could be wrong with that? I'll tell you. I belive that computers are ruining our society. Now don't get me wrong, I like them, but they can be bad. People get on and never get off, you never no who it is your chating with online, and they can cause tons @MONEY1 stress. Let me explain why computers can ruin lives. When the computer was invented I'm sure this wasn't the purpose. To stay on playing mindless games, or randomly searching the web. Some scientists have even studied the @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 the time, the more you are online, the more likely chance you will become obiece. That is not what @LOCATION1 needs. You say you'll be on for a minute, but you will stay playing ""@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2"" for days on end. People with @CAPS3 work to do might never get on. Also it is just flat out a waste @MONEY1 time when you could be outside playing a @CAPS3 game. My second reason is that when you are ""chatting"" or ""@CAPS4'ing"" someone, who is it really? A study conducting proved that when you think your talking to a friends it is really some perverted @NUM1 year-old looking for ""fun."" @CAPS5 huh? Also when you talk, someone could be inbedding a virus in your system that could take @MONEY1 to fix. How mad would your parents be? It could be happening with every letter you press. Finally stranger or not, some @MONEY1 these people leave links to get to disgusting websites that you pray your parents don't see. My final point is that computers are proven to cause more stress. When your on @CAPS6 or @CAPS7, nasty fueds between friends can occur that affect you and your school work, inflicting damge to your grades. For every @NUM2 people when join a social page, @NUM1 get worse grades do to this issue. Also when your parents are online for a long time, the next morning they must rush to get ready for work and are tired, afffecting their quality @MONEY1 work. In this economy I don't think we need more layoffs. Even simple things like a virus or a slow upload could and will cause stress, in fact @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 @LOCATION1 have a stress issue due to computers. I've told you today why computers are bad. They get sucked in stressed out and stalked. Now computers aren't all bad, just use them right. These are the reasons I think computers can be bad."	6	5		11																					
810	1	"Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper, I belive that computers have a very positive effect on people. Computers can help kids with homework. Computers also let people learn new things. You can even communication with friends. There are many great uses for a computer. Kids have lots of homework and without computers it would be nearly impossible to finish it all. At @ORGANIZATION1, students recieve a project almost every month. We need pictures, information, and it must be neat. Computers are about the only way to find pictures, information, and make it neat. Kids also get a ton of homework and computers are very important for it. In science class we get a packet for homework for every new unit and without a computer it would be really hard to get done. You can also learn many things you never knew from using a computer. There are a lot of uses for a computer and one of them is learning. There are many educational websites on computers. If you were traveling somewhere and wanted to find out more about that place you could search it on the internet. Even if you're reading a book and come across a word you don't know you could look it up and you will find it. Communicating with friends is also important and computers offer many different ways of doing it. There are facebook, @CAPS1, and videochat. You could use facebook if you want to talk to friends or videochat also to talk to friends. Those things are great if you want to show pictures from a vacation or talk to a friend in a different country. These are all great ways to use computers. I definately think computers have a positive effect on people. They help with projects and homework, learning new things and communicating with friends. Computers are great."	4	4		8																					
813	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you know any child or teen between the age of eight and seventeen who doesn't live to go on the computer? Well myspace, facebook and aim is like a online hangout. Kids every where log on and don't log out unless the parent of the child makes them. I firmly belive that computers have major effect on people, my three reasons are people don't have the exersise, they dont interact with others, kids are smocky they will sneak on if doing research for if wasnt . Online websites and games are like hipnotysing the people and making them stay on for hours. Most parents belive that having their child on a computer doing research for an hour is good; however kids are and would sneak to pay online going or go to a website they were not allowed to go on and wasnt on before. Sometimes the best thing to @CAPS1 is get some fresh air and interact with others. Buth with websites that make people stay conect for more than two hours they dont get fresh air and they dont interact with others . Most times people forgot and dont know what something is except for how a computer because they play on it so much. People grow up fast when you think about it, and people start to eat, drink, sometimes sleep at the computer. People stay at the computer and eat their, they wont get enought exercise, they will start to get fat and soon an only stay at the computers because they didnt exercise burn the fat off. How you see how computers have a major effect on people by not interacting with others, not having enough, and kids wife sneaky and will go on other website, they wer not allowed to go on and if thier parents wernt home."	4	4		8																					
816	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a student at @ORGANIZATION3 middle school in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 recently you produced an article about computers where good or bad people I write today to say that computers are beneficial to people everywhere. This is true because computers help people with things hand eye coordination to learning advances to our schools finally it helps people communicate with ease, @CAPS7 plase consider the following. First of all computers help hand eye coordination greatly in the long run. This is true because people playing games on the computers got more skillful with using ther hands and eyes together. @ORGANIZATION1 ullodhers from @ORGANIZATION4 @LOCATION1 ""Computers help hand eye coordination @PERCENT1 more than putting your son or daughter on the football team"" @CAPS8 computer games could help kids get more acurate with there skills or that of any sport. @CAPS7 now you know why computers help people develop better hand eye coordination. Secondly Computers help people learn new things. Although people might think to be false it is indeed true. @ORGANIZATION1 a recent study at @ORGANIZATION2 shows that @PERCENT2 of schools in @CAPS6 use computers for research.Finally recently had a paper about @PERSON2 and The only scorce I thought of was wikipedia on the internet because it is faster than searching for a book about him. @CAPS7 now you understand the computer is a helpful learning tests. Finally the computer is a great way to communicate online. It is better than @CAPS10 because it is faster and more than calling someone up and talking for. @CAPS8 it is alot cheper than @CAPS10 because you just have @NUM1 payment a-month unlike phone. Where it starts to add up. Inract @PERSON1 or the @ORGANIZATION2 of @LOCATION1 in a recent study that ""@CAPS10 are absolete now, with the internet peope can chat at lignning speed"". Finally using e-mail or facebook is @CAPS7 much better than phone tag on facebook you know where you can chat with. @CAPS7 thats my reasons that the computer is good for communicating. @CAPS7 now you see that computers are nessecery because they develop hand eye coordination, they @CAPS8 help people learn and finally they are a great way to communicate."	5	4		9																					
822	1	I think that you can never spend enuf time on the computer it feel there is no bad effet computors can have on you they only improve your life is why. For one thing if you need to find out a important fact date or time. You can just look it up on the computor. The internt is a never ending sorce of knolage and you can learn just about any thing that you need to know just by searching it on the computor.Another usefull thing the computor dose is the ability to talk to people useing eother @CAPS1-mail @CAPS2 or that rooms you can meet new people or talk to a distant friend or relitive on the computor and you can even hook up a web camera and actuly see theam as they talk to you something a phone cannot do. Also the computor is a good souce of entertainment. You can play a number of games off the internet. You can even down load consal games onto your computor. Another thing you can do is watch full episodes of @CAPS3 shows and movies like if you wer fallewing a telivison selles and you missed an episode you can just go look it up. And a favorit of mine is youtube wether you watch random videos watch famous youtube stars on post videos of your own ther is always fun to be had. And finaly all the programs on the computer ther is an endless amont of programs you can have downloaded they can be for fun such as paint and flash or they can be important like worn or knot book every program tha computer offers is usefull and fun to use and you can use most of these programs to help you in the real. Now I have mentioned some of the many thing why you can never spend enuf time on the computer shure exersise and nator can be helth but you can do only of that stuff I just mentond by takeing a nator walk so wont you agree computors improve our life more then they are unhealthy.	4	4		8																					
824	1	"Dear editor, I hear you are looking for your citizens opinion in if computers are bad or good. @CAPS1 opinion is computers are bad. I think computers are bad in three ways and I want to express them to your and hopefully persuade you into going towards @CAPS1 side. Smell nice out to day. I can smell flowers, the grass, and many more, @CAPS1 first reason why computers are bad is if you use the computer to much you don't see enough of enjoying nature. Nature is beautiful, it has @CAPS2, green grass, rainbows (sometimes). You can make a walk of in the moons and just be yourself and be by yourself. In other words nature is very nice and you should set out and enjoy it. If you don't enjoy nature it might be no late, because soon it become and rainy and then, yes fem has flabberlasting colors, but what comes after fall, winter. Winter is not nice, it is cold. You work, because you need to shovel the drive way and your car off and that can get very tire some. The goof of is you can get those chorse. Oh not that make me to. @CAPS1 next reason why computers are bad. When was a good smile run. @CAPS1 next reason why I think computers are bad is spend all working and no time exersing. Excersing is a very fun thing to do, you fel to go outside. Hang with friends, any many shore. Exercise is a main way of staying healthy. don't you can really get unhealthy, and sick and his dies, die i have a friend whom nothing use. The computer his body rest weaker and weaker so exercise ias am main piece of staing healthy. there are many ways to health you can bike, run, walk, rog canate, climb a mountain, etc. The posibilitys are endless while exercesing in the park you never knew you can meet. car's fast say your friend, ""yo sup man,"" ""not, you"" ""not much, just fiding around for some exercise"" ""same here, same here"" see you never know who you can meet in the park now that was @CAPS1 friend. he is alwasys here, out how as you think, yep in the same park. I wouldn't have met him if i was insine on the computer. Like i said be what was @CAPS1 friend. But since I come here every day i can meet a new friend every day maybe. So @CAPS1 last reason why I think the computer is bad is because you don't get enough interacting time with friends and family. I love @CAPS1 family but I interact with them. If they are exercising who if i am here on the computer. no one can. In conclusion I think the computer are bad because you can not get enought time exercising, enjoying nature, and spending @CAPS3 time with family and friends."	4	5		9																					
826	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a student of the local middle school technology is utilized to the fullest. Computers have helped us write essays more efficiently & complete research assignments. However, personally I feel that this constant usage of computers has a negative impact on people. Firstly, computers hinder interpersonal connections. @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION1 help keep in touch with old college buddies', but no computer can replace face-to-face communication. From hard, cold text, one cannot decipher subtle connotations or wit. Bot, people are beginning to replace seeing one another with @CAPS3 networking. With the technological revolution came games like @ORGANIZATION2. These games are addicting, @CAPS4, our society mocks ""nerds"" for spending too much time playing these trivial games, but it really is a serious issue. For example, in a recent study done by @ORGANIZATION3 students, ""@NUM1 out of @NUM2 teenagers who play computer games do not get the recommended amount of daily exercise."" This is because these games are so absorbing. The amount of time put into gaming. Ultimately consumes all free time. This is dangerous, because a gaming addiction can lead to delusion, @CAPS3 inadequency, obesity. @CAPS2 a people, we are quickly learning that what was once so genius, is actually dangerous. If one was to stare at a backlit screen for hours on and, their eyesight would definitely start to deteriorate. Loss of eyesight is just one of the negative impacts computers have in our health. @CAPS2 aforementioned, obesity is issue. Now, couple this with bad eyesight, @CAPS5 @CAPS6 deficiency & a negative outlook & you've got yourself a issue. All of the deseases brought on by computers can be just by less time on the computer, & exercises. Naturally, @CAPS2 a specie we were not to spend so much time in a fixed position. This static state is a new phenomena that is aquiring major health problems. The over usage of computers practionally, robs us of our time, destroys our health, & hinders our @CAPS3 interactions. This makes computers a negative influence on people & their health."	5	5		10																					
836	1	"Dear local newspaper @CAPS1 I think that kid's should be alowed to go on here computers. So they can talk to there relitives across. The @CAPS5 @CAPS2 they want to. I have family members in @LOCATION1. I talk to them evry day because I have a laptop and they say that. I have relitives in @LOCATION3 I belive them because I have there email. They told me about my mother living in @LOCATION2. So I asked her she seaid yes that is true and I looked up were my mom lived. Thanks to computer also I learned that @LOCATION3 has one of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 in The @CAPS5. So I asked my mom @CAPS2 I can go to @LOCATION3 she said yes. So I went with my sister and we even visited are family members and the @CAPS6 point I can tell you it looked exacly how. I pichered very tall coverd with trees. Birds @CAPS7, scwerwels climing trees the thing, that surprised me the most was there was a house on top of the mountine. For sale I wished that my mom was thier because she will love it. So ever time we go down there we rent that house thanks to the computers. Lastly you can even look up people on the internet. I herd that criss rock almost died. So when I got home I went on my laptop and looked it up so I did and it said nothing about. That but it did say one thing that surprised me. The most it seaid that he was geting a divorce. From his wife I think the peorson how said. That he almost died most of missed read it. So now I look up all my fraverit people. Thanks to computers the time is now to accet @CAPS2 people should have computers to use to lern about the @CAPS5 or just think what everyone sayes. So I hope you make a good chouse. But befor you choose think about it."	4	4		8																					
854	1	"My opinion is that the more that we stay on the computer. The more we get lazy. One reason that I say this is because, a computer is a big handy person in reality. Second reason is, people stay in the house sitting down on the computer other than exercising. The third reason is, people just sit in the house, and an't enjoy fresh air with their loved ones. First, the reason why I say a computer is a big handy person because it does most of the things a human can do. That can lead a person to being very lazy. Just too sit in the house and go to websites. It has a big effect on a humans life. The computer technology have contecll over a huge population of recae. It really make miss out on half of their day. Second, people stay in the house on the computer other than exercising. It's very unhealthy for a person to sit down at a computer all day. The person has to eat so, basicly they eat and sit back down at the computer. It can get out hand because the computer allows people to grace food online. So that right there is an example of people not getting ecersise, and being lazy. You need to get your ecersise dayly. So people that doesnt get their ecersise need to start. Instead of sitting down on the computer all day. Third, many people over whole world have a lot of love one's that they care about and love. ""But"" they dnt get time to be with them, because they are always on the computer. The computer shouldn't take you away from you outdoor life. Okay, so what you can talk fo your friend and family over the computer. It's never like seeing them in person. Go outside and have fun and happy memories with your family. Because the computer is just words being texted. It's nothing like being said. I garrented you that. If you spend time with youre family then you will want to do it again. While your going out excersise and be interacting. In conclusion, if you are allways on the compute that's not good. Just take a few hours out of the day and ecersise. Go out and have a marvelous day. Because the computer doesn't do nothing but make you lazirer (@CAPS1 YOU). If your allways on the computer just be sure that you get your ecersise and your time with your family. It will make your a better person!"	3	5		8																					
855	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have both negative and positive affects on people. Many people before us went through everyday life without them. Although there are many good affects that computers have on people, the negative affect's outnumber them by far. For example, generations have lived and died without computers and it didn't affect them. Not only that but many children and adults in this centry are obese due to growing technology. Many people become obese because they were born with this technology and after years, or even days of sitting in front of their computer, they become lazy. They look to a computer as necesity and not a form of entertainment. Even though computers keep people in contact and keep them updated in their lives, that is the only important reason for a computer. As a student, I use my computer for my schoolwork. Everything I do on my computer involves either typing a paper or printing research. I could do these things with paper and pencil and ask people what I'm trying to find out. This is important because it shows that people don't need to be defandent on computers when they can do everything they need to without them. Lastly, computers aren't needed when we have the availability of cell phones that keep everyone in contact without computer games, chats or profiles. Also phones are safe so they cant get viruses and strangers cant look at your personal information, finding out where you live. In conclusion computers aren't healthy, keep you sitting, without exercise and aren't nessasary."	4	4		8																					
860	1	"Dear @CAPS1, More and more people do use computers, but it is not a bad thing. Student come home from school tired, bored, and doesn't want to go outside and exercise. Students would rather go on the computer. When students go on the computer they can chat thier friends, listen to music, or learn about distant places. Firstly, students would chat their friends on the computer. When it is winter, students can't go outside and exercise. Students can grab their laptop, and go on their warm and comfortable table bed to chat friends. Maybe a friend can help with homework. Going outside in the winter can make students sick and miss days of school. Secondly, students like to listen to music. Music is an important part to a student because music lyrics can express themselves. Students @MONTH1 be dancing to their favorite song. Dancing is exercise and adults do say we need more exercise. Also students can play very soft music than not doing homework at all. Thirdly, students can learn about distant places. When I am on the computer I type in www.google.com and want to learn about a place where I want sto visit other student might want to learn about places they've never visited. Italy, france, @LOCATION1, and much more places people would want to visit. They would want to learn about places before ever go. In conclusion @CAPS1, more and more people go on the computer, but it does not have to be a bad thing. Yes, students should go exercise but all the time. When students go on the computer they can chat with friends. Secondly, students can listen to music. Thirdly, they can learn about distant places. @CAPS1, it is not a bad thing that students go on the computer."	4	4		8																					
863	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are very dangerous to the modern day socity and how we are connected to them. So I belive that these atroshish things should bery well be disposed of. There are good reasons of thinking such a thought that is in this time with such an eviormetal breakdwon we need to get close to nature while it's still here. Next today our interaction is very low when if your talking about actuall talking to the person and because of computers it makes @CAPS3 all the more lazy while sitting around doing nothing. Lastly the @CAPS2 is harmful and expensive not to menshon the fact that the enviorment is already falling apart. The way natures heading we will all end up dieing no thanks to computers. First how hamful it today is @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 own computers. In america theres only @PERCENT2 is nature with nice forest but as people reporduce more will be gone forever due to expantion. So be one of the @NUM1 out of @NUM2 that instead of staing iside views the great things the earth has to offer. Next these computers our little robots that are really taking over the world and its getting very dangerous with how much it's destroying the ability for humans to breath this happens because theres a hipno disk in all computers making us stay close sufficating us like a deadly drug it's a horrible addiction. Lastly @PERCENT3 of deaths are due to @CAPS2 overloads imagene all the lives that could be saved if they just went to breath every @NUM3 minets I mean on average @NUM4 hours a day your looking at a @CAPS2 take time off make a goal for say @NUM5 hours. This addiction will kill us and knone knows how to talk about it. Secondly, millions on top of millions live in the @LOCATION1 @NUM6 keep on their computers for ours on a time you would think that their alone in every @NUM7 people are done the rest are being killed by chatting on the @CAPS2 and letting their life flow right out of the window. Now interaction is harmful as you already know but you forgot @NUM8 a day do elligal things on the internet like download music wich they shouldn't be they could be put away for up to @NUM9 years for this talk about an iteraction, with the police. Lastly web inter action like myspace they haves satified sexual effenders who could come to your house at only time and take you away would you like that to happen you could never see your family in every @NUM10 people @PERCENT4 are kidnapped due to myspace alone stand up out of danger. Thats a harmful work it is. Finally the dangers of a world like this with how the government whats to mess you up. These people are considered are mad and dangerous with laywars who want to get you. One in every @NUM11 people can't keep up with payments. Next did you forget about those other @PERCENT3 who dont have computers they are living the life walking with @CAPS4 on the edge of myth. Lastly and unfortunatly those @PERCENT1 perstent witho computers are likly to die within the next @NUM12 years due to a dealy poisin that the compute diliveres to your brain. In conclution this world can be one of the more angerest. So come to gether get a friend go for a run now and then. No friends go talk see your family instead of one of those vertual meaings. Just keep in mind the dangers of the @CAPS2 world and how it wants your money. Now what we need to do is attak the robots back. People should go for a run cut of some of the obisity from sitting down all day lose @NUM9 pounds or more. Remember the world would survive if you trash that zombie @CAPS2 room.

877	1	"Dear editor, I believe that computers are an important part of modern life and proves itself to be available because everyday. Many times we don't even think about using computers, it just becomes a part of our dayly routine. We use computers everyday in many ways, sometimes to stay intouch with a far away friend learn about and experience faraway places, or @MONTH1 be ever to practice hand eye coordination. Computers are so benifical to our life we might not be able to live without them. Most people have experienced a friend or relitive move, when this happens not all hope is lost because with the use of you run stay in touch. Many computers nowadays have built in webcams which alows you to get more than just an email. With these systems you can actualy get an image of your fried or relative. Even oprah winfrey uses the webcam feature on computers to have people ""skype"" on to her show. In adition to this there are many other ways to stay in touch even if your computer is older and have. These reletively new ""social networking series"" include facebook, twitter, and many more. Every morning when i wake up and on sportscenter i always about what famous are posting or twitter pages. This is just another great use of computers. In this economy not many people are spending thousands of to go to a beach paradise in the but with the use of computers, you can go there virtualy. Computers are great in this aspect because they alow you to learn and experience many expensive things for. For example if you wanted to learn somthing about india, you would dn't have to go to the local library and check out a book, you could just type there are many such as this that give you access information that you could ever need. This prooves also to be valable if you are studing faraway while a paper. The computer is just a great way to get information with out every having to leave your home. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill that many people lack. It alows you to throw a baseball, play videogames, or even drive car. Many computer sceptics believe that you don't benifit from using computers but a recen study done by @LOCATION1 news and report reveals that people who use computers had @PERCENT1 better hand-eye-coordination than computers users. When driving you often need to operate the car, up the radio volume, and pass out goldfish to your kids at the same time, so this could be as where improved hand-eye cordination would be handy. Hand eye coordination is an important and this skill is further developed by the use of computers. In conclusion, computers are benificial both in hand-eye coordination and in communication, as well as in geting information or a topic. Computers are one the most significant ever and are valuble in many many ways."	6	5		11

That is why I think computers are good. Computers can be used for many different things. They can be used for buissness. Some people work at home on computers. They can also be used to interact with people far away. You can interact with someone who you don't see on a daily basis. Computers can also be used for research. You can do research on a school project or on other buissnesses you interact with. Computers are good. Some people use computers for buissness. You can also interact with people far away. You can even do research on a computer that is why computers are good."	2	2		4

While some people dislike the world's large usage of the computer, I happen to disagree, I feel that the computer is a great @CAPS5 to put out and find information. I also feel that it is good @CAPS5 for people to communicate with ther family and friends who live far away. Lastly, I think that computers provide us with fun activities, entertainment, and a @CAPS5 to relax. What do you do when you want to know what the capital of @LOCATION3 is? You either go break out the old atlas, or, with a simple click of a button on the computer, discover that the capital is @LOCATION4. My point is that with computers, finding information is fast and easy. Also, with computers you can share information as well as receive it. Lets say that you are not a doctor but have discovered a cure for the common cold by using iteams find in everyone's households. What do you do? Well, you could go to the media and do interview after confrence after interview, or, you could simply post it on the @CAPS1. It is plain to see that the computer in an important not in the process of exchanging information. ""I'm sorry @PERSON2, but we can't fly out to @LOCATION1 to see @CAPS2 @PERSON1. We don't have enough money."" I think that everyone has heard a variation of that line at least once. But here comes the computer to the rescue! With computers @CAPS2 @PERSON1 over in @LOCATION2 level is just a click (and or screen) away. By using webcams, you can speak with someone across the world without having to worry about the expensive costs of flights! No webcam? No problem! You can send someone very far away a message through e-mail or instant messaging. Say ""bye"" to expensive phre rides, long phone bills, or years going by seeing a loved one. Computers are,not just tools that are used strictly for, computers can be used for purposes as weel. In other words, computers can be used for fun! How exactly does the make computers have a creative on society? I'll tell you how. Many @CAPS4 are workaholics, also known as people who warr @CAPS5 to much. After a long day of signing papers and fiddling with a budget, wouldn't it be nice to just sit down and play some solitare? Thats possible with a computer, and you don't even need a deck of cards! Computers are full of fun games, like solitare and chess. These games are a great @CAPS5 to help people relax, and trust me, everyone needs relaxation. Having some downtime can really help someone to be a healthier and happier person! Aren't computers great? They can let us to exchange information talk to family and friendss across the globe(without a big pore tag), and they provide us with entertainment. So everyone out there could does not like the effect of the computers have on the public, please reconsider. Computers really are a helpful, fun, and useful tool to society."	4	5		9																					
898	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have affect on people because firstly, it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. Secondly, it allows people to talk online with friends. Thirdly, gives online games to little kids. Lastly you can wacth video's that can teach you all sorts of exotic things. My first reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. For example if I want to go to @LOCATION4 for the @DATE1 and I know nothing about the place I can go online and look up I can look up their foods, their culture, their villages, and even there landscapes. Also the computer is good for book reports if your teacher told you to do a book report on @LOCATION5 instead of going in your text books, goion line you can look up their culture, there food, there location, how is there economy like, what kinds of school the kids go to what kinds of festivals they have etc. My second reason computers have affect on people is because it allows people to talk online with other people whenever they want. For example there are @NUM1 things that let you talk on the computer and that is @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 these two allows you to talk to friends that live faraway from you, my friend lives in @LOCATION1 and I live in @LOCATION2 we don't have cellphones so we go online to eiether @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 ""isn't that great""!!. The computer also allows you to talk from faraway places like if you live in @LOCATION3 you can talk to somebody else in @LOCATION6. My third reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives online games to little kids. For example when I say games I mean educational games like reading games, math games, writing games, etc. Statistic say the @PERCENT2 to @PERCENT1 of kids learn more things on the computer than they learn in school that a huge percentage even for kids. Also when kids play computer games it more fun to them then sitting in class all day like my litt "	4	4		8																					
901	1	"Dear local news paper, In @CAPS1 oppinion I think that those who makes compiuters should make up an times added to the compiuters. There should be a law that people has to go out and exercise before and after then use compiuters finally, I think that childrens should use the compiuter less than the adult fee health reasons. @CAPS1 first oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should make timers added to the compiuters to time tha amount of tim people should take depending on what they are doing like when some one is playing a game they spend hours playin instead of doing a diffrent activity. Also like when a person is doing their home work they start getting carried away in taking their time going slow and ends up finishing very bad. @CAPS1 second oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should have a law that people has to go out and exersise before and after they use compiuter because there is a big percentage amount of people who are obeast because everyone sits in the sits in the compiuters and starts to eat while they are playing games and watching videos for hours and they dont take a break to go outside and @CAPS1 third and final oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should have childrens use the compiuter less than the adults for health reason's because kids are always looking at the compiuters an their eyes are always getting red and then they start to not being able to see as well as they used to then they end up having to need glasses or abetter perpscription glasses. Also becaus kids are usually going into chatting sites and they start to talk to people who they dont know so they end up getting raped or kidnapped by the person that they went to talked to for hours. So local news paper will you make that change for the society and for the childrens? Because I would!"	4	4		8																					
907	1	"Dear newspaper and readers of @LOCATION1, I am @PERSON1, a student from @ORGANIZATION1, I have recently been enformed about the argument over computer use and I feel it is silly. We need computers in life to help us do jobs, communicate with family or friends traveling the world, and for research on homework. First of all, without computers many people would struggle. My father uses a computer for his job and he couldn't do his job without one. Sure, many people spend way to much time on their computer, but other people use it to save information or find research. I know people argue that computers should be used less, but could you get through a week without using one computer? Most people couldn't, especially if you own a buisness. In addition, from using computers for jobs, some people like to chat online with a friend that move away. Imagine if your family member or friend traveled constantly and they went to places where they couldn't get connection on their cell phone, the only way to talk to them is chating through the web. I'm sure everyone has used a computer once to talk to a friend or for something related to buisness, so they are more useful than people relize. Lastly, as a kid we need to be able to use a computer, not just to talk to friends but for homework. Some homework requires us to make powerpoints, write a paper on historical facts, and we need computers to do so. Without computers, kids wouldn't be able to gather facts or information to write a paper. Decreasing computer use for kids can potentialy bring down their grades. My teacher always says, ""grades are the most imfortant thing."" I'm sure all parents would agree with that. All in all, we can't decrease the use of computers because it can do damage to peoples lives. Think about people who travel alot, kids with work that needs to be done, and parents with jobs that they need computers for, don't upset all of these people by decreasing computer time. Thank you for your time,"	5	4		9

Computers a very good effect on our town's specify. Computers areaids in tracking hand-eye coordination. They give people the opportunity to look at things & talk to that it traveled here they wallets empty faster than the speed of it. @CAPS2 also have the ability to help people so things that an than a pig sty. Let me explain more these reasons. Computers are very good for our society because they are kids in tracking hand-eye coordination to kids & adults. Just to help you understand why in to teach hand-eye coordination, @CAPS2 are so many that help you learn but help you learn will get you. In foot ball catching helps to teach the skill but makes you up on the ground after being by someone potentially yourself. In baseball swinging at a pitch to teach his skill, but if the is very close to you it could how you for the if you do the ball could someone & hurt them, ability to day back. Computers are great way to this skill in a saw Even @CAPS1 @PERSON1 here in town says that he has seen an of kids with better hand eye coordination, due to do have a good our town? Well, computers let people to that. You can talk to relatives in far away places but to travel with this. I'm sure that you're wondering if I have I do have another reason. Computers have to samethings electronically so fast easily, make a look on computer's hard drives, @CAPS2 are so much more that ran be on a computer, that make a room empty. Before my famiy had a computer complete dedicated to papers files that your so important & that we could not lose. When up got picture, typed up paper, saved our was empty! I hope that this letter has proves to you computers effect on our society. Computers help and in the process of hand eye coordination.

923	1	"Dear @PERSON1, Experts are concerned about the use of computers. They say that they spend hours on the computer and less time exercising enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I agree. While people use the computers, they don’t interact and meet new friends in person. They stay inside and don't get excersise, and kids might talk with strangers. When we use computers we chat with friends online and don't really interact with others. We meet new friends and chat online and never meet them and socialize, so that is one disadvantage of a computer. Another problem is lack of exercise. While we are on the computer we spend a lot of time and sometimes causes us to even forget to exercise. Then we slowly begin to get unhealthy. Another major problem of computers is talking or chatting with strangers. Some might meet some random people online and give them personal info. Kids might even meet with some of the strangers they talked to online and get hurt! well thank you for reading my opinions about computers. I hope you take them into consideration. Kids and even adults dont interact with freinds, lack exercise, and give personal information to strangers."	3	3		6																					
927	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I agree with some of the perfesionals that think the computer keeps people from exersising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with friends and family. Some people thnk it's cool to be on the computer @NUM1 @NUM2. The truth is the computer with internet is like having @CAPS1 at your fingure tips, distractions, and more. You can find just about anything on the internet these days. Some people use the internet for doing homework. Sometimes people can find the exact answers to an assiment. That means they are becoming more dependant on tecnologie. If the world becomes more and more dependent on the of computers and such, that could mean things. the world is suffering because people are neglecting to pick up their trash and to try to stop @ORGANIZATION2. Most people, instead of taking action, will be on the computer. People are becoming more and more lazy these days. As I stated most people are becoming more and more lazy these days because all they have to do to have fun is sit and do little movement. Saying that, people are neglecting to exercise and eat right. They are also neglecting to spend time with friends and family. Instead of texting or @CAPS2 someon try to call them. Or maybe even wehn you're free you can go and make plans to visit with your family. Taht's all I ask is that you especially spend time with family because you can always get more friends or anew computer. But your cant get a new family."	3	4		7																					
939	1	I think having a computer is good because you can research stuff and you can meet people and chat with them. Computers are important to society because it helps keep track of info like doctor appointments and crimnal records for police to follow by. having a computer is a good but if you spend to much time on it you will hurt you eyes. Having a computer can help you talk to friends who have moved and have website that they can talk to you on like myspce or facebook or even yahoo chat. When having a computer its very helpful in life and can help you in a lot of areas. Computers can also cause problems like spending to much time on it and not getting enough sleep for school. Having a computer can also be bad because sitting to close or spending to much time can hurt your eyes and cause you to wear glasses. The way i look at it as i see is that to much is bad so i think spending some time on it is good do you agree?	3	3		6																					
944	1	"Dear @CAPS1 I think more and more people use computers because it can help you find a job if you lost it. Because right now some job are going bank ruded. And parants can not help because they didn't have job to support there love ones. Another thing is that cars are going up on prices so if you don't have a lot of money you can go online and get a car and truck for great prices. And it can help you save a lot of money in your pocet. For some reason @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people like to go to far away places for example @CAPS2, put or @LOCATION1, @CAPS3. And you if go to these place then you would need place to stay and have a good meal with your family or friends. So you would need a nice pleasant holetitle which will have awsome food, beds, pools and more thing people like to do when they is on vaction. And for example if your mother or father what you to go to your public school but you don't what too because you heared something or about the school say because you cant find great school online for example @CAPS4, cap pre, classicle, brizzal, And some other school are the best to and fun to go to and be succesful with your life. Now you know why more and more people use computers and you should always use technology and it would help you on the hand eye giving people the ability to learn about use computers."	4	4		8																					
946	1	"According to the @ORGANIZATION1 govermant @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 spend @NUM1 hours or more on a computer a day. A study shows @CAPS1 are't getting enough exercise, aren't spending enough time with fmaily, aren't enjoying their lives. Right now people would rather be on the computer then doing other stuff.Since more people have been using the computer those people heven't enough exercise. Now @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 have gone obese since they have always been or the computers, @CAPS4 year a @CAPS6 was fit and healthy, but when a friend told him about a website within the @CAPS5 @NUM2 minutes. After @NUM1 months, the fit and healthy @CAPS6 became obese. The @CAPS6 would always have junk food when @CAPS7 was on the computer. when @DATE1 came, @CAPS7 tryed out for his school baseball team. @CAPS7 didn't make it because @CAPS7 was out of shape. After that happened, @CAPS7 went to his old ways by eating healthy and exercising. Now that @CAPS6 is in shape for any sport @CAPS7 plays. Next people aren't spending enough time with their families. A lot of jobs require people to be on the computer. When that happens a person will forget whats really important to them. A couple years ago, a @CAPS6 was going to have the biggest game of his life. It was the championship game. @CAPS7 was reminding his dad about it all. When the gone was about to start, the @CAPS6 looked into the crowd for his dad. @CAPS7 didn't see him at all. The @CAPS6 was just think his dad was. after the @CAPS5, @CAPS7 looked again, but now @CAPS7 was sad. His own dad wasn't at the game. His team @CAPS4 the game. Now his dad doesn't miss a thing since @CAPS7 doesn't go on the computer as often. Finally, people aren't enjoying their lives they would rather be on a computer than doing stuff they like. One @CAPS6 used to always play basketball with his friends when @CAPS7 started to go on the computers, everything changed people would ask him to play, but @CAPS7 would say no. The computer was the only things that mattered. When the @CAPS6 tryed out for his @CAPS8 school @CAPS7 didn't make it because @CAPS7 forgot how to play. When that happened, @CAPS7 stopped using the computer and went back to basketball. now when @CAPS7 tries out., @CAPS7 makes. It's now or never to decide either waste your life on a computer or live your life. I would rather live life than be on a computer."	4	4		8																					
958	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that computers can prevent you from doing a lot of things? Instead of going on the computer you can exercise more, play outside, and spend more time with family and friends. This is why you need to spend less time on the computer. Exercise is important to your body and computers are not. you can get some weights and exercise in your room. A run out the beach doesn't sound bad either. Just by doing that you lose a lot of weight and not gaining weight on the computer. So go exercise and lose weight because it's good for you! Computers also prevent you from getting freash air and playing outside. When your are outside you see that playing is much better than just pressing buttons and clicking everywhere. On the computer. You don't even have to play outside, you can just walk with someone or just sit on the grass and talk. The computer prevents you from doing all of this fun activities outside. Spending time with your family is a huge activity that your computer is prevting you to do. You are on the computer for an hour and your family is having a barbeque. You finally get off that computer and you realize that spending time with them is so much fun than sitting down and looking at the screen. this is why computer are a distraction to everyone because you don't want to exercise, play outside, or spend time with the family. you can use the computer but just don't stay on to long because you are missing the fun."	4	4		8

962	1	"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I think computers are a good thing. It is good because you get to learn about forein places. Keep in touch with family and friends and it is good entertainment. First, computers are great to learn about forein places. On the computers you could research a place and look at pictures before you go. If I wanted to go to a far away place like @LOCATION3. I would go on the computer and find the best part to go to and I would look at different hotels to stay at the reviews it has gotten. Aslo, if someone were to do a paper on a different country or even state that they've never been to they would go on the computer. Sure, you can get the same info from books but you can filter out what you don't need on the computer. In my history calss, I had to do a report on the state of @LOCATION2. I have never been there so I want on the computer. Books could have given me the same info but computers are always up to date and accurate. Seecond, computers help you keep in touch with family and friends. There are numerous websites that allow you to share photos and talk to friends or family. I recently signed up for facebook and I am able to talk to friends instead of using mytexts and running over the phone bill every mont. My dad has a facebook too, he talks to people he hesn't seen since he moved heve from the @LOCATION1 white mountains. Some other sites are aim, aol, and myspace. Lastly computers are good entertainment. Computers allow you to see that concert you didn't go to or that movie that's never on tv. When I went to a skate board demo at skate lair I had tons of fun. The other day though, I started thinking about it. I went on youtube and type in""nike sb skate lair demo"" and clicked on it. i watched it and about halfway through it I saw my face! i was so exited. Computer also allow you to check the news and weather. This is good because if you are on the road and you want to see what's going on you can take out a laptop and checked the weather or news. That is why I think computers are necessary. Yes people do stay on four hours at a time but most people only go on for a small amount."	4	5		9																					
973	1	"I am writing this article to inform you on how most people are spending their time an computers. In this article I am going to tell you about computers and what people are doing with them these days. Some people use their computers for business of work related. But then again these are people that use them for entertainment and other social things. These are the people that just sit on the computer all day. What they could be doing is enjoying life. Going outside and getting fresh air. But no they want to sit inside all day long on the computer. Now is why do people want to stay inside all day long on the computer some people are constantly on their social websites. Such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. They are obsessed so thoes are teo websites that are very addicting to some people. and then these are the people who just like looking things up. Then lastly just get off, go spend time with your family the computer will always be there. And use the computer only when you need to. Yeah its fun to go look up things for your entertainment. But all things are good in moderation. So I hope you will listen and also agree with me I think I made my point about how much you should use computers. So thank you for listening."	3	3		6																					
975	1	"Computers are a common household item these days. Due to how much computers are able to do, most people spend a lot more time on the computer than they should, and it is affecting our society. Computers can be very helpful, when trying to find information on a topic, but some people take it too far. Some people, their jobs are on computers. Others like teenager will do gaming or have instant messengers, which sometimes takes away from outside activities. Another situation with computers is that adults can get really into online gambling which is terrible for a person to do even at a casino, but now they can do it from their living room couch. Computers can also keep you in from outside, to get fresh air and sunlight. Computers are bad in someways but good in others. Sometimes computers are a pefect resource. When your history teacher assigns you a @NUM1 page essay on the civil war and you have no idea what happend in the civil war. In this case computers are good. Or your boss could tell you to find the amount of teen deaths in car accidents due to cellphones. Computers seem like a perfect resource. So far you've learned computers have their highs and lows but if computer time was limited then people would be able to do more stuff outside, or read a book. Some people might abuse computers others might not but if computer time was just limited I belive, that a lot of things would be different in our society today."	4	4		8																					
982	1	"In my opinion, I do believe that computers are good for you. I agree so because one, it can help you to communicate with other family members around the world. Two, it can teach you new languages you really desired to learn, and three, it can keep you updated on whats happening around the world. First, i believe that computers are good for you because it can let you communicate with your long-lost relatives you hardly see anymore. For example, if you miss any of your family members, you can simply go to your computer and search them up so you can type to them or talk to them through via chat mode, then you won't ever have that missing feeling anymore since you have a computer. In addition, computers can teach you how to learn new languages you alway's wanted to know, like, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2, or even @CAPS3 if you wanted! You can just simply go to your computer and type in ""language of @CAPS2"", and listen what it tells you of @CAPS2! Moreover, computers can keep you updated on whats happening around the world! It is way better to see it on computers than on tv's bevause computers give you more information about the situation of the event! Likewise, you could click, ""locate area"", on the computer and see in which area the incident took place in. You could also see the video's, behold the images, and seek the location of it on the computer. Sadly, my lecture has come to an . Those were my three main reasons why computers are good for people: You can communicate with long-lost relatives of yours, you can learn new languages, and therefore be updated on the qhats happening around the world. Would'nt you wan't to uphold those amazing events also?"	4	4		8																					
988	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I think computers aren't good for people because they could spend that time exercising, hanging out with friends and family and reading. The first reason I don't think computers are good for people is because they could spend that time exercising instead of @CAPS2'ing you could ride your bike or even walk the dog, exercising @MONTH1 be hard work but, it's better then staring at your computer screen. Just because you eat well dosen't mean your healthy. You need exercise to stay healthy too. So, run, ing, walk the dog, go to a gym instead of sitting at the computer. Another reason I think computers aren't good for you is because in the time your on the computer you could be hanging out with your friends and family. Lets say your family is going to the beach, you stay home to play games on facebook. Your family comes back talks about all the fun they had, even tho you weren't there. You could have been apart of those memories. Now time to compare with your friends. Its movie night, all your friends are going. But, you stay home to webcam with your aunt. You stayed home both times just to be on the computer. You missed out on a lot. My final reason I think computers are bad is because, instead of computer time it should be reading time. Looking at a computer screen and reading is a lot different then reading a book. Reading books increases your vocabulary, you learn about different types of litature. Over all reading books makes you smarter. When your reading online you just read what people say, basically rumors. READ! In conclusion I think people should spend more time exercising, hanging out with family and friends and reading instead of being on computers."	4	4		8

I can agree, with there, but I truly believe that computers can have a positive effect on society if used correctly. With computer on @CAPS21 side, I believe there are many positive effects towards computers, such as: there are many things to do, you can from the internet, and it is very entertaining. If you have a computer, I'm sure you can agree with me that there are tons of good things you can do. For example, I know of many online colleges. Ever heard of the commecial, ""@CAPS1 in your @CAPS2's?"" that is where students can got their @CAPS3.E.D and have a succesful carreer. Not only that, you can get discounts on many items just by shopping online. There are many shopping sites online, such as @ORGANIZATION1. Furthermore, many shops like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have a catolog online, where you and effenly. Lastly, if you have close relatives or friends that live far away, there are many options today like @CAPS6, (@CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9). Webcam programs like which you see and talk to each other using a webcam and @CAPS10, where you can find your friends and check how their doing daily. These are all good reasons why computers are sucess in the economy. Some computers are used for entertainment. Online there are many @CAPS16 you can play, like @CAPS11's (@CAPS12 @CAPS13 Online @CAPS14-@CAPS15 @CAPS16) I play many of these, including @CAPS16 such as @CAPS17. I love these @CAPS16 because they are very amusing world. You watch many of your favorite movies watch funny obeses on the internet via @CAPS18. @CAPS18 is a world-wide used source where you can watch or upload videos so the world can see. A @CAPS18 video is ""@CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21 @CAPS22,"" a young boy gets bitten by his younger brother. This entertainment system is also a great way to use up time lik if you're bored. I can see how people be to it, but you just need to use it wisely and make a plan to use the computer maybe an hour a day. A computer also has many great sources you can learn from, like an online website that has fun @CAPS16 called @CAPS23. With this, you can play many fun @CAPS16 while learning about interesting facts about science. In @CAPS21 science class, we use this websites many times, to us learn about motion/gravity. You can also conduct research on the web, you with many projects. I know I use the web to with almost every project I have."	5	5		10																					
1013	1	"I think people should not spend so much time on the computer. This are three reason a think that. My frist reason is if people stay on the computer for a long amount of time it can mess up the way you see. My second reason itis that you could be spending time with family and friends. My last reason is that people that sit all day on a computer gain more weight. First I think people should not be staying on the computer all day. Because it can mess up the way you see this can happen because from u looking at a computer screen all day or eyes can get mess up. I think u should never stay on a computer for no more than a hour. And sometimes u no u been on it for to long when ur eyes started to hurt. My second reason u should not stay on the computer for a long time is because when u are secting there. Doing wat you are doing. You can be messing out on fun thing that u can be doing with ur family our with friends. But some people would just like to sect all day end look at a computer screen and some people start not to like going out our even beeging a social person. My last reason people should not be on the computer for a long time because some people will just seat there and eat food all day. And this will make them get more weight. And this can make there life wader because now they are on heelthy they are just seating down all day anyways. And they should be going outside end running around. This are my three reason I think people should not stay on the computer all day. One it mess up they way u see, second you are messing out on fun thing u can do with our family, end last people are graning more weight when seat on the computer all day."	3	4		7																					
1016	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, More and more people use commputers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society and I am one of theose people, that does not agree. I disagree, because is your on the computer all day you'll forget bout things. For example, you will forget to exercise, you will forget nature, you will also forget to interact with your friends and family. I promise you if you keep on reading you will understand and realize my point of view. People soend to much time on the computer, and they don't exercise like they should. Exerising is very important, that helps you with . Exercising helps you grow. it makes you stronger. If your on the computer all day then, you'll exercise and develop right. Another reason, I think its such a lead idea is you do not get to enjoy nature. When your on your computer you can not go on an hike in the woods. You can not go on camping trip. You can not do the thing, in the pleasant air of nature. The last reason but defenitly not the least you will forget to interact with your friends and family. That is so important because a computer could do a lot. It could teach you a lot but it canot do it you and @MONTH1 I love you. Only youre family and friends could do that. Hopfully you under and realize my point of view. People should stop doing this you forget to exercise nature and to spend time with you friends and family. All I got to now thank you for the oppurtunity to listen to my idea."	4	4		8																					
1017	1	"Dear, @CAPS1 I believe that people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer because they do less exercising, they don't interact with friends and family, and its bad for their health. People shouldn't spend so much time. They wont enjoy their life outside of their houses. My first reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is that its bad for their health. Spending to much time on their computers can strain your eyes. Some people with seizures including myself would trigier an attack and cause us to space out. Spending to much time on the computer can mess up your vision or damage your body. To me thats very unhealthy. Another reason why spending so much time on the computer is bad is that you don't interact with your family and friends. On the computer all the time can make you forget to spend time with your friends and family. You would get addicted to being on the computer all the time. You would forget to say hi and how are you to your family. You won't spend time with your friends and they will start to ingnore you and think that you don't care about them. Being on the computer all the time will mess up your soical activitys with other people. My final reason why spending to much time on the computer is bad is that your not enjoying nature. You don't realize how much you are missing because you are on the computer. Yes you can learn thinks by the computer but you can also learn by doing it yourself. Being on the computer to much will make you not want to exerise and that won't be good for your body. You would forget to at least go for a jog, discover new thing. You realize that exploring nature is better than just watching it. Those are my reasons why spending to much time on the computer is bad. Its not health. You don't interact will your friends or family. Also you won't enjoy nature for yourself. So just get off the computer and enjoy what life gave you."	4	4		8																					
1018	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 back a couple decades ago, before computers existed. What do you see? There were children outside exercising, playing with friends, and living somewhat danger-free lives then came the computer. Computers are driving the next generation to a dangerous life of staring at an assortment of pixers all day longels well as ruining any civilized relationships you had. I strangly believe that computers have a negative affect on society. Did you know that as tha number of computers sold increases the obesity rate has gone up @PERCENT1 since computers came into our lives why? Because people spend way too much time on and not enough time exercising! Computers another affect of the long hours spent in front of screen is a decrease in eyesight ability. My family friend, @PERSON2 had to get glasses because his eyes were damaged by the computer. ""I'm worried about my daughter's eyes...she stares at that screen for hours on end!"" @CAPS2 @PERSON3, a concerned parent at @ORGANIZATION1. How could something so harmful possibly be good for our society? Speaking of hurtful, the internet is very unsafe. Predators surf the web, looking for young, innocent people to meet and most likely abuse @PERCENT2 of parents much been monitoring their children's computer usage parents are unaware that the internet makes it easy to talk to anybody in the world, from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2! Monitoring would also come in handy when it comes to innapropriate videos, pictures, and discussions on the internet. It is so easy to be surfing the web and fall upon things you should not be seeing! Lastly, people easily get caught up in being hidden behind a computer, and say mean, hurtful things that would never be said to one's face! these unfortunate factors cause many of the issues between people today. Speaking of which, computers have a very negative affect on relationships nowadays. As I mentioned earlier, so many fights happen through computer communications. Even if online conversations are friendly, they get people accustomed to making people ""@CAPS3"" through a computer, not face to face. After being in a computer-oriented friendship, people tend to forget how to act face to face and find personal meetings awkward. @PERSON1, an eighth grader at @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, ""I can't @CAPS5 only talking through computers, never being civilized with other human beings! Unfortunately, that is where computers are leading us to..."" @CAPS5 never seeing your best friend in person , only through technology! It @MONTH1 not even be your friend. It could be a dangerous poser! This is yet another problem...through the internet, you @MONTH1 not even know who such relationships are with! It could be fake, and you'd have no idea. Spending all day rolling away in front of a computer, putting yourself and relationships in danger is, unfortunately, the effect of computers. Computers are not worth the terrible consequences civilization must face. I @CAPS6 urge you to stop the advances in technology now, before it is too late! Make the change today."	5	5		10																					
1031	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I beleave that computers have a good and a bad effect on people. Even though I think it has both effects on peope, I think that it has a better effect I think this because the internet gives people the chance to learn more about other places. Allows people to talk to family that lives far away, and it also helps to make new friends. I support the advances of technology. I support it because people can talk to their family that they can't get to see. I have three cousins that live in @LOCATION1 that I never get to see, but with computers I can talk to them all the time. We can email and @CAPS2 to chat to eachother to find out what they've been doing, hows school, and so much more. My aunty loves to send and get pictures from them to see how much they've changed since the last time we saw them. Without the new technology we wouldn't be able to do that. Computers also help learn about other countries and the people that live there. With the internet you can find what the country looks like, what types of food they eat, what type of language they speek, and so much more. Recently I had to do a project in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 about a place in @LOCATION2. I got @LOCATION4, @LOCATION3 with the help of computers I found out so much more about the country that I never even know about. There were so many great places to visit and learn about the history of @LOCATION4. Learning so much about the place makes me want to visit there someday. Without computers I never would have learned so much about that place. Another great thing about the new technology is that we can make new friends and talk to different types of people from all over the world. I read recently in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that atleast @PERCENT1 of kids have a myspace or facebook that helps them interact with people from all over the world. There can also be dangers to talking to people you've never met before. To be safe don't tell people your phone number or where you live. But meeting new people can also be good. For example, my cousin doesn't get along very well with the people she goes to school with. But after school she goes on her computer and talks to people that are just like her. Either way she should be careful. In conclusion, I must say once again that I support the advances of technology to an extent. Computers help you talk to family that you don't see, helps you learn about new countries, and meet new people. Thank you for your time."	5	4		9																					
1033	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 technology was grown exponetially during the last few years. The use of computers especially has sky-rocketed. However, I beleive this is not somthing to be excited about. The use of computers all the time can effect people's health, family and friends, and their apprciation of Nature. The ove useage of computers is a huge problem. Have you ever sat infront of a computer screen for hours on end? If so, you know the feeling of sleepiness and irritability. The lack of exercise while using a computer impacts people more than they realize. Excessive use of ocmputers has been linked to obesity and high blood pressure. the more people use the computer, the higher their blood pressure. Just sitting infront of a screen is terrible for people's bodies. To stay healty, only use the computer when it's absolutely neccesary. Going on all the time can seperate you from others. This g eneration, adolecents especailly, use the computer to comunicate with others more than actually talking to them. Communicateing only over the computer can draw them away from people socially. Not ot mention how fast rumors and secrets spread over the internet. Useing the computer can ruin relationships even those with family. Being neglegent of family by always being on the computer can draw people apart. Families can became a non-important thing. People can't pay atttention to their families while sucked into a computer screen. Computers are creating false substitutes for almost everthing, even nature. Humans started out living i nthe wild, gathering food from the land and giving back by raplanting. Our connection with nature was strong. We needed it to thrive. Nowadays, however, instead of listening to the sound of rain and the crinkling of dry leaves, people prefer high pitched artificial beeping and the classic ""You've got mail."" People do not appreciated nature as they used to, as they should. The beauty of nature is simply overlooked as if it's nothing special. Well, without it we wouldn't be alive. Life cannot exist with nothing to thrive off of. We can hop on our computers and look at pictures of nature on @ORGANIZATION1. com, or we can grab our shoes and see it for ourselves. No one can experience the greatness of nature while on the computer. No one can experience the feel of cool lake water sliding over their skin or a hot @DATE1 day while emailing a friend. It can't be done. Computers have robbed us of our ability to experience creature. In conclusion, computers are horrid for people. They can affect health, friends and family, and appreciation of nature. We must use computers only when neccesary in order to stay healthy. Instead of going online, get going outside."	5	5		10																					
1038	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a world without computers. I picture it as a better place. Why wouldn't you want to make the world better. Computers @MONTH1 be helpful for work and business but young children are losing time to exercise, enjoy nature, and interact with family and friends. What do you prefer having computers or no? In my opinion people would be better off without them. Lack of exercise is brought up countless times in society. Computers is one factor to blame with the @LOCATION1 already being one of the most obese countries in the world who would want to add on to this cotastrofy. If the number of computers used in each household increase the amount of obese people in @LOCATION2 will as well. If computers take away exercise than health issues will more often and at a younger age. Dr. @PERSON1 says ""if kids are spending more of their free time on the computer rather than increasing the risk of diabetes will increase for them"" @CAPS3 it also a possible result in less exercise. Older citizens will be a big target for a heart attack. It is said that five out of six people could have stopped a heart attack just from taking same time out of their day to go to the gym or take a walk. No one should lose exercise over playing virtual games and instant messaging on the internet. Less people get a chance to enjoy nature when they are on the computer all day. If more people cared for nature then global warming would not be an issue. In my opinion the citizens of @LOCATION2 would want to keep it more clean and be more about their. more people cared about nature and enjoyed it wildlife would be taken away from animals. People would put an end to what some people and companies are doing to nature. Lastly when your on your computer all day you don't realize what nature has to offer fresh air and animals. Or endless canyons needs to enjoy nature more, computer should not be in their way. Wouldn't most people that their relationships with family members and friends could be a lot stronger if they interacted and spent time with them instead of with their computer. @CAPS2 how much a dinner conversation and family party could improve if people were closer with their family. Plus people need family. Your computer can't get you through the emotional pain if losing a loved one. @PERCENT1 of people can get through difficult and stressful times with family. Last but not least your social life could improve if people werent on the computer all day. Not interacting with people could turn you antisocial and not fun to be around. No one wants to be that way. Also your computer might not be working all the time, but your family and friends always will be there. The world would be better off without computers. I think everyone that sits in their room on the computer could change their exercise, enjoy for nature, also family and friend relationships by getting off it and do things that they will actually benifit from. There is no need for a computer in your life, but don't speak for everyone. The question then is do we stop using computers or do we turn them off for good."	6	5		11																					
1039	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some parents are concerned about their child being on the computer all the time. Now I'm going to talk about @NUM1 good things about computers. @NUM1 bad things, and @NUM1 things on what you should do. One good thing is that you get to talk to people. You could talk to your friends online about something in school or whatever. Thats good because what if you frogot what was homework or you need help on something, you could go online and ask them. Another reason why is that you get to meet @ORGANIZATION1 people. For example @CAPS1 or facebook. When you meet @ORGANIZATION1 people online they mostly come from a different country that you never heard about and then you just learned some thing @ORGANIZATION1 and you have a friend from @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2, or @LOCATION1. One more good thing their is, is that you learn @ORGANIZATION1 things online about anything. It could be a @ORGANIZATION1 website that you never heard about and something that can help you in the future. For example @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 could help you out a lot. Now where going to talk about @NUM1 bad things that computers do. The first bad thing that computers do is that they make you adicted. For example me I got adicted when I had a computer but not I'm not we got rid of ours and now I just play with my sisters. The second bad things is viruses. My grandmothers computer got a virus off of a website that website was @CAPS1. When you get a virus it sucks you cant do anything or you can't look anything up for school. Getting viruses are not cool you have to wait a week or so before they fix it. The last bad thing is that you never want to spend time wit your family. I know some people who do that like its not cool if company comes over get off the computer. Since I dont have much time left I'm going to talk about one thing you should do. You should have a certain amount of time on the computer and go have fun and do what you want to do except go on the computer. Thats what I think you should for now."	4	4		8																					
1041	1	"I think that people shouldnt use the computer's that much because it make's you want to be on it and on it day. Like yea you can play games on it and talk to people like other people you use of lec see I can understand that but the other people around you like that live's with you people that on the computer all day can spend time with there family and friends and to other places then going to look at them on the computer's I mean like to see other people that you see on the computer like chat or like webcam on the computer, you can maybe go see in a other state and go visited them. then being on the computer people that always on the computer should get out because there never going to do things is they are always on the computer, like when @CAPS1 on the computer @CAPS1 on it for a hour are so the I do things with family and friends, but not all the time that @CAPS1 on it, like i understand if you work on the computer at work and then finishing things at home for your work, but once in a you get to spend some time with family and friends, not @CAPS4 be on it all the time. Some people @CAPS4 come home and @CAPS4 go on the computer and that how people get lazy the start getting fat because they @CAPS4 go on the it and maybe stop to eat and back on the computer, then when they get off of it they will eb all tierd and stuff not feeling like going anywere @CAPS4 to sleep or like if they had sometimes to do after they would be all lazy an not wanted to do anything at all, that why people should get out more and do thing withe there family and friends to have fun withe there like."	3	3		6																					
1051	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 society should have computers because it teaches you things that a school or job will never teach you, and it allows you to be in contact with your friends and family that you don't see a lot. I would like for you to appreciate my concern on how @CAPS1 society should have computers. First, we should have computers because it teaches us things that we might not have been taught before. I say this because if you wanna know about the @LOCATION1 more and the school or job doesn't teach you as much as you wanna know, then all you have to do is look up on the internet and theres a chance you gonna find it. @NUM1 people would rather have computers to look up things instead of not knowing that much about something at all. Next, we should have computers for @CAPS1 society because we could contact people online that we heven't spoke to. My opinion is that if you haven't to a friend or family member in a while you can talk to them online. Also, if they don't have a phone or if they do but it's long distance and you can't talk to long distance on your phone, you can tlak to them on or email each other, etc. Sample say if your phone isn't working and the only thing that's working is your computer you to it in contact with somebody. All you gotta do is talk to them online. Would you rather talk on the phone or computer. In conclusion, @CAPS1 society should have computers because we could learn about things more and we could chat with people. I would like for you to aprreciate my concern on having computers in @CAPS1 society."	3	4		7																					
1060	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 a place where they are all on computers all day long, everyday. I don’t think computers are a benefit to society because you get less time exercising, less time enjoying nature, and you spend less time with family and friends. Computers are not a benefit to society. To begin, computers are not a benefit to society because it gives you less and less time exercise. And wouldn’t you want to go exercise and lose weight. Other than just sitting around on your new computer and having your brain being wrecked out by it. @PERSON1 said that @PERCENT1 of people that get a new computer spend @NUM1 minutes more than what time they usually spend on it. Next, is that you could be outside enjoying nature. New @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Newspaper said that they are worried that it too many people got a good computer that no body would be outside enjoying what left of nature. Because sooner or later there wont be any trees left in the world and humans would became extinct for eternity. Lastly, is that you wont be spending any time with your family or friends. Like when I got x-box live, I couldn’t get off of it. I was addicted to it. And when my family got our new computer, my older sister couldn’t get off of it. She would spend all day and all night on it. Now, if parents take the computer away from kids they will have more time to exercises more time to enjoy nature, and more time with family and friends. Computers are not good toward society."	4	4		8																					
1063	1	"Computers can be very useful to people. They can help contact friends and family from all over the world. You might need it for typing a paper for school or work, and you can use the internet. If you had a friend or family member move away, computers are an easy way to contact them. Phones dont always give you that option to call from around the world. Say your bestfriend moved out of the country you could email them or instant message them through computers. What if you want to chat with someone right next door even if theres a blizzard and the snow is four feet, computers are a simple way to contact them. When my friend went to @LOCATION1 for the @DATE1 I used instant messaging to talk to her. Imagine your at work or school and you were asked to write a five page essay. Do you really want to write it all? Imagine you, writing out hundreds of those newspaper everyday. Typing is an easy solution that doesnt require as much work and it takes less time. Typing also makes work a lot neater and easier to read. Not even a library has all the information you need. What if you need to write an article for your newspaper about a newly discovered animal? A library wont immediately buy new books about it. The internet is an ideal way to get information the moment it happens. What if a celebrity got hit by a bus or a rocket in space just landed sucesfully? You cant expect to go to the other side of the country to watch and take notes. The internet gives information on anything possible. The internet also allowes students to take online schools or classes. When my oldest brother couldnt take @CAPS1 in high school when it was needed for college, he took an online @CAPS1 class at home. The internet also helps you find vacation spots when your going away from home what if you need a plane, train, boat ticket? What if you need to rent a car but you cant go over to the store or airport. You can go online to purchase tickets. Have you ever heard someone say ""@CAPS3 it upon google"" when they dont know the answer to something? I remember my friend telling me about her new dog, I never even heard of. When I got home I went on the internet and researched it. The internet is a very useful tool to everyone. Going on a computer allows you to talk to anyone, anywhere, type anything needed, or to use the internet. The computer makes life a little easier and its fun too, and would be a handy tool for writing a newspaper."	5	5		10																					
1073	1	"To my opinion computers have a negative effect on people I think it has a negative because it causes people to get less exercise you spend less time with your family and friends and it distracts you from things get done. First of all computers have a negative effect on people because it causes them to get exercise. For example, there are many football, soccer and baseball games practicingg these they will just computer on the webcam all night. Another way is that you can get work done. WIthout even leaving your house. You can shop online, stay home and work online, and even go to college those things include getting out around, but now you can just day and do those things and be lazy. Second, the computer causes you to interact with people less. Now, when family or friends. i went over my I sat right and she didn't even look at me playing computer games. i know that a lot more kids too because I was reading in a magazine that @PERCENT1 of interacting with their kids as much as they got a computer. Lastly, i think the computer has a negative effect because it them. It distracts kids conversations first of all when people to talk with someone on the computer it is very hard because, they are absorbent in they're doing. Secondly, the computer distracts kids from homework. I know this first hand, because wherever I have in type up assignments I get and end up going on different websites, and not getting my work done. lastly, it distracts kids from household chores. Some kids just put them to the side and forget to do them because they're budy playing game or surfing the web. i know that if I did I'd get in big trouble. Those are the reasons why I think the computer has a negative effect on people. Because, it causes them to get less exercise, they don't interact with people, as much, and it distract them. So unless you want all those things happening to you, I suggest you spend less those on the computer!"	4	4		8																					
1081	1	"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I think computers have bad effects on the people in this world. Yea they have their plus' and negatives hut computers are some what dangerous. Some people who use computers use them for the wrong reasons. Some people search porn sites, and hack into servers. I believe computers are supposed to be used for positive things not negative things. Another reason why I'm against computers is the people online are dangerous. A lot of people think they're talking to one person but it's really not that person. It could be anyone. Nowadays, people just give out information to random people. This is how kidnappings and murder happens in our world. @CAPS3-@CAPS2 is also a major problem with computers. (@CAPS3-@CAPS2) - means @CAPS2 someone over the computer. The effect of that is someone getting hurt on a crime not being solved. People also spend way too much time using computers. Instead of getting outside and enjoying nature, they waste time on computers. This is also the cause of a lot of obesity. People become obese due to not gettiing out and excercising. This world uses computers for the wrong reasons. This needs to change."	4	3		7																					
1082	1	"Dear @CAPS1, You use a computer a lot right? Good if you @CAPS7 because @CAPS7 you beleive that experts are questioning why @CAPS5 use them a lot? Well I think people need them because its how @CAPS5 know whats going on in the world, its how @CAPS5 know how the weather is like so accidents can be avoided, and you you can flip on your @CAPS2.V., but than you have to wait for what you want to go on. So you decide @ORGANIZATION1, should @CAPS5 be outside more? Don’@CAPS2 you need to know whats going on too? Of course you @CAPS7, everyone does. I think that it is important that @CAPS5 know @CAPS4 a meteor is about to strike the world no? President @PERSON2 even says the computer is where @PERCENT2 of the world gets info. On whats going on. Are you just going to sit there and not listen to the president of the @LOCATION1? Don’@CAPS2 think so. Im @PERCENT1 sure that @ORGANIZATION1 doesn’@CAPS2 want to be known as the accident State. Well thats why @CAPS5 need the computer! For people to know if I will snow, sleet, or if there is bad traffic than @CAPS5 need to go to the internet to find out @CAPS4 and where and what time. CEO of @CAPS3, @PERSON1, says “@CAPS4 someone says ‘@CAPS5 might be getting some snow or rain’ than they usually go right to the internet ” You you can turn on your @CAPS2.V. to find out whats going on, but not all of it you will want/need to know. So you will have to wait. The internet just does it right on the spot. No waiting involved! (unless you have a bad internet connection) @CAPS7 you think these reasons are making a good argument? I @CAPS7. @CAPS7 you use your computer for finding out whats going on, what the weather is like, and instead of the @LOCATION2? If so I think you would aggree with me."	4	5		9																					
1083	1	I think that using computer is fine. Reason why I think you have family from far away. Instead of talking hearing voice on the phone. They can talk to each other but most of all see each other. Show cool thing you have that are new. When you have a love one you can see them when there a way for a trip. Computer are helpful when your car is broken down or when you have no car. You can buy stuff at store by the comfort of your home. Almost everything you can get stuff out of store because they have online store to mail to you. Also now you can buy food on internet and lots more. Saving money computer tell you where to get good prices to save money. Lots of dating sites to meet diffent people to go out and give your commets. Texting on facebook can let you save money by texting for free. Playing free online games with your friends. You can make website and you can watch movie and show online. There just a lot of thing you can do on a computer. I know lots of people don't go outside exercise but I agree with some expert. Lot of people need to lose weight or need to go outside more to the real world. This techology people are big they don't go out more. They eat lots of food. But computer are very helpful in lots of way and its so fun. Those are my reason why I think that computer are great and sould be used more.	3	4		7																					
1085	1	"Computers have helped people tramendisly over the past years. Thanks to computer scientest have found cours for deseses, jobs have become easier and communication with friends or family have become afordable. I believe that computers have a positive effect on people because they educate people on places in the world, help people with their jobs, and give people a chance to talk to phone without having to pay for anything. Is someone a trip to a country that they might go on the computer to learn more about that country and their culture. Another thing they might do is go to a website that could have them find afordable flights or a hotel to stay at. If a child is doing a report about a country in @LOCATION1 they can go on the computer to find out facts on that country. Computers educate people about places all over the world. You can go on a website that has videos and short clips about what has been going on and learn about current events. any costs. If you want to see a friend for her birthday but don't have the money to fly halfway around the world to see her you can vidieo chat with her. Computers help people save money by talking on the computers with friends, family and even co-workers. Computers have been very helpful ever since they were invented. They help people learn about places all over the world and about anything you want to learn about. They also make jobs and work easier, and also help people save a lot of money by talking to people on the computers insted of on the phone. Computers have improved demastrecly over the years, the screens use to be so small and you would have to press all these buttons just to boot it up and now computers can be as big as a flat screen @CAPS1 and you can turn them on with just a push of a button.

1087	1	"You say that computers are bad on todays society? @CAPS1 I'm here to prove you wrong and tell you that they can actually benefit todays society. Maybe some kids don't have phones, so they can go log onto facebook and do everything a phone has to offer and more. School. School. School; so many homework assignments and projects are assigned, and using computer programs help alot and give that proffesional touch. And how coud you forget 'google' the most famous online system, that everyone loves you can do just about anything with that page. So computers bad for society, think again and listen closely. blc computers have just benifited us more than ever. www.facebook.com, that is one of the most visited pages on the internet for all different ages, it deffinetly benefits you. Logging on and seeing your friends profile's newest updates on pictures, videos and life, you get every little detail using facebook. And I you don't have a phone, no. wornes, facebook has a chat system, so you and friends and relatives can talk, or maybe theirs a family party comingup you can get inboxed on all the information, and visit the relatives homepage and see how theyve been doing. @CAPS3 you haven't logged into facebook yet, you deffinetly will now! ""This project will be done on the computer,"" how many times do you hear a teacher says that, almost everytime youre given an assignement! @CAPS1 windows and @ORGANIZATION1 programs will really benefit you in your need for school help.

One program you can always use throughout life for presentation is 'power ', In my history class we were assigned a famous person from the @DATE1's and were to do a presentation; @CAPS1 when I got my assignment I went right to powerpoint and got a great grade! lastly the known, @ORGANIZATION1 word! used for all kinds of projects or homeworks and espically writing papers or short stories, having spell check, youre garenteed a good grade! Google! Everyone knows it and everyone loves it. This web hit canbe used for just about anything. From searching pictures and information for a school projects, watching videos of songs, friends, or tv shows that you love or wonna check up on. to looking at websites. Some say the @CAPS2 holds people from exersising, but google can shows you videos of special work outs or websites on healthy eating or an on exercise group or fitness club, so now you see the internet benefits us tremendously!

1090	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion about computers is that they benifet people. they help people when they need it, it gives people entertainment. So that is why computers benifet people. @CAPS1 first reason is that a computer can help people when they need help like for instace if you have to write a paper and you need to look something up such as reseach you can use the computer or if there is a long main cwayshion then you can look up the formula. So as you can see that is why computer benifts people @CAPS1 second resson is that it gives people entertainment, such as myspace, you twitter. And those are social networks, if you like to watch tv. or listen to music there are websites for them also. So that is why I said computers give you entertainmen too. @CAPS1 third resson is that it helps people such as if you in different contries and you can't go see them you to them through instans or web cam. Or if you are home schooled and you dnt see other kids your age that can talk to the on the computer. So as you can see that why I say you can through the computer. So as you can see that is why I say computer are very benifical be cause they give you entertainment they let you communicate and they help people so."	3	3		6																					
1092	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, Are you always telling your kids to do their homework and get off the computer? Well, I might just be able to help. Computers do not benefit our society today. People are spending to much time on them; not enjoying the outdoors, and are taking away time to spend with friends and family. I believe having a limit each day on your computer might help solve these problems. The computers can be very distracting and you can use them too offten. Stairing at the computer screen can damage your eyes and kill brain cells. Thats one thing kids and adults dont notice. You need your brain cells for school. Joins and other activities, computers can also distract you from completing work, and then you have to stay up late to finish homework should come before the computer. Time flys by as your clicking and typing. The next thing you know as it's ten o'clock and your work is not completed. Since my schedule is so busy after school. I try to complete my work, then go to the computer before dance. This way I am my friends and relax. Taking time away from the computer is a smart idea. As it comes to @DATE1 time the weather is going to be beautiful and you don't want to waste a pretty day on the computer, @CAPS5 human body needs oxygen. Clearly, computers don't supply that. A great way to recieve oxygen is going outside for some exersize and energy. Playing outside can offer a lot more than a computer. You can swim, jump, or play sports. My doctor once told me, "" Everyone should have atleast an hour of exersize a day. ""You can't accomplish that by sitting at your computer. Next time there is sunshine out, no matter what season it is, go outside and take a break from electronics. Spending time with family and friends is a fun way to stay off the computer. Friends and Family are not people to take advantage of. They are people who are there for you when you are down and make you laugh. When your relatives come to town that you havn't seen in a while, You don't want to spend it on the computer. Talking and catching up with one another is a great way to re-connect. During family holidays, we don't bring our computers. We shut them off to spend time with each other. Friends and family are special gifts. So, don't throw away friendships or relationships with your family. Get away from the computer and bond. (did not finish)"	5	5		10																					
1095	1	"Dear Newspaper, I thought that I should express my concern. @CAPS4 are becoming to dependant on computers. @CAPS4 need to go outside more and be active. While some people @MONTH1 think were not wasting our time on the computer. I @CAPS3. I'll should only go on if it is nessesary. People are always coming up with @CAPS2 gaming ideas to draw people in, but what people dont realize is that is doesent only waste there time in waste our money too. Electricys bills are trough the roughtAlso instead og going out to meet @CAPS1 people are staying home and talking on social networking sites which make them less social. Children are not enrolling in sports which makes them losse any physical strength they would get. Also children could be getting over wait by just sitting there with no pysical activitys, @CAPS2 ideas like microsoft word is fine but going on every day for games is. Teachers, parent, and all need to show these that the computer is not the only thing, Computers can benifit us very well, by letting us have knoledge of somthing at the tip of our fingers. Computers can and will take away family and friend time. Now im not saying that computer but what am saying is that it effects everyone around you, @CAPS3 just the person thats using it. What @CAPS4 need to @CAPS3 is get together and unite. @CAPS4 need to go outside more, and exersise. @CAPS4 need to stop the computer with adults. Therfore, lets make this a better place. and get out and have a little time for going on to the computer."	4	4		8																					
1106	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 you know that eight out of ten homes in @LOCATION1 have at least one computer if not more? Computers help us with daily things and make many tasks, like writing an essay, much easier. They benefit our society in many ways. Without computers some families would lose contact with loved ones who are far away, not to mention it can keep many things very organized and neat easily. Maybe the best benifit is how you can learn about far away countries and cultures with the click of a button. Computers have endless posibilities to how they can benifit our society. Many people don't realize that some families can not be with eachother so easily as other. If a family member is in the service somtimes talking on the computer is the only chance they get to commnunicate with their loved ones back home. Saying that this is not a benifit is a lie. For others who don't have such sevier need of communicating it is still a convinient way to have a conversation with someone far away without racking up the phone bill for a long distance call. Also many times this can be an altenative to parents buying their children expensive cell phones. So having a computer is defanitly a benifit to communiting. The computer can also make many tasks much esier, for example if you were assiangned a @NUM1 pages essay in school typing it on the computer would be much neater and quicker than writing it all out. Also many buisnesses relay on computers to keep data organized and all in place. Like the program excel, @ORGANIZATION2 created this to make a simple way to organize data. It is much more efficient than than having every thing in different site with millions of texters in every draw. So another benifit of the computer is that it can keep tthings organized and poride easy ways to complete evey day tasks. Maybe the greatest benifit of the computer is how much you can learn so easily. Say I was curiouse about the recent earthquake in @LOCATION2, if I wanted more inofrmartion @CAPS3 head straight to the computer. You simply go to @ORGANIZATION3 or another search engine of your choice, type in the subject, one click, and bam you could read for hours all of the websites and articles that would come up. The computer is full of information, and is right at our finger tips, this is definitly a huge benifit to our socierty. The computer is a wonderful tool that can asist in so many ways, wether it is communication organization, or just curiosity. This advance in technology is just another way to improve every day life. Computers don't just benifit our little town of @LOCATION1, they benifit our whole socoety in all of the amazing things they do. "	5	4		9																					
1126	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, I strongly believe that we need computers. Computers are very helpful they are a very big part in are world, ability to learn about very interesting facts, and they allow people talk online too. After reading my letter I hope you agree with me. First of all compters are important because as our world gets more technilque inclined compters are need for almost every job and you will want people to know how to work a computer. Police officers use compters to find want criminals and put criminals into the computer to keep them on files. Schools use computers everyday for kids to do reports on, find information, and do homework on too. As a student I know that kids use computers all the time. For example @TIME1 I used computers to do my math homeworks that my teacher assigned me. After you read my letter I hope you will agree with me. Secondly you have the ability to research places all over the world. Another good thing with computers is that you can look up the news and be updated everything that is going on right now. Computers are just great to use because if you don't like write you have a computer and you might even get it done faster if you are a good and fast type. I use computers to do all my essays and book reports for @LOCATION1 I also use it for look at the news to see ehats going on in the world. Lastly computers are get because they allow you to talk to people online. You can either email them or talk to them from a web cam. Online chat is good to keep in touch with a friend from far away or even ask a friend ehat the homework was tonight. I like to ise a web cam for the reasons I just listed because on my birthday my sister could't come home from college so we hooked up some web cams so she could be there when we open presents and song happy birthday. After you read my letter I hope you will agree with me. I hope I have persuaded you to show you that computers are very important and that why we use them so much beccause computers are very helpful, they give you the ability to learn interesting facts and they allow you to talk to people online."	5	5		10																					
1142	1	"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 you know that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 spend to much time on their computers. I belive people should spend more time outside with their family. This can certainly lead to brain problems, hard time seeing and the biggest thing is death. First of all there are people with brain problems because they are on the computer to much. When they are out with their family they think of their computer. People stay on their computer for a non-stop amount of time. In a resent survey it showed that teenagers stay on the computers the most. Most people don't have a life outside their computer room. Most of all eye doctors have been getting call from parents. They are worried that their child/children have a hard time seeing. I interviewed an eye doctor and this is what he had to say, ""I had one child come into @CAPS3 office and he had the hardest time seeing"". He asked the kids mother why is he having a hard time seeing and she said, ""@CAPS3 son spends on average of three and a half hours on the computer."" The child had to get a pair of special glasses so that he could see better. These glasses aare really expensive. I have read about children and adults deing from using the computer to much. They have fried their brain from using the computer to much. Their brain tells them to do things that are illegal. For example: breaking in homes, killing people, and high sacking cars. I heard one kid used the computer to much that he started to kill people and got shot by a cop. The more people die from using the computer to much the higher the death toll will be. It is now or never @CAPS3 friends out there to work together on cutting down on how much we use the computer. I'm sure that no one wants to be part of the death toll until we really have to. It is time to go outside and have fun with your family. They miss spending time with you. So get off your butt and go outside. But wait, make sure you trun your computer off so that you are not temted to go back on it."	4	4		8																					
1147	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 staff, Are computers helpful to us regularly? Computers are very helpful machines that increase productivity daily. Computers not only help people discover @ORGANIZATION1 places and learn more about other parts of the world, but also computer allow people to communicate with others around the world. In addition, computers have word processor and other applications that help workers do their jobs daily. So, now do computers help people learn more about our earth? Many teachers and students use computers daily to help them teach. There are many online websites that help students discover and process different areas around the world. For example, there is a @LOCATION1 website (www.canadamaps.org) and this website has a map and students have to match the place/area onto the map. There are also website such as mapquest & yellowpages to help people navigate cross country and around town. As you can see, computers also help students education and just our everyday life. A large amount of teenagers of all ages like to use a programs on computers called @CAPS1. @CAPS1 stands for @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. This program allows people of all ages to talk with their friends or colleages instantly. What one does, is type in a chat box to someone and the message is instantly sent to the person. Emailing is used for many things. To catch up with friends, or to talk something with another. One can also attach documents that @MONTH1 consist. Emailing helps things go faster as well as your computers. But, if your newspaper were written out by hand, then that would take a lot of time, people, paper, & money. As you can even see, @ORGANIZATION1, computers are a necessity! So, as you can see computers really are needed. Computers affect us in many ways that aren't noticed clearly or easily. Like I said, computers teach and help people learn about different places among the world today, helps us communicate with others around us or in @LOCATION2! And as well, allow us to bring our work, family, friends, and cases everywhere we, in addition to computers allowing us to word process papers so our lives are ease for our everyday life. So, don't spent your life on the computer but use it for our needs. Please use computers to help our everyday routine. Stop writing on that pad, get up and type it on your computer!"	4	5		9																					
1149	1	"Dear Newspaper, Advances in technology, while amazing, don't always have a positive effect on society. That is why, I honestly believe computers do not benefit my community. For instance, computers can be very dangerous and people these days just seem to spend too much time using them! Not to mention, computers cost way too much money. To begin, my mom and dad always say, ""don't talk to strangers,"" when I go out. I think they should say the same when I go to use my computer. Computers can truly be dangerous for someone who isn't careful. For example, online predators often depict themselves as someone they aren't. Therefore, you can't ever really trust someone you simply met in a chat room. Also, cyber bullying is another problem computers put people at risk for. Another danger computers have, is anything posted on the internet can be accessed by almost anyone. This includes pictures, blogs, comments and. I believe society would be better off without the constant worry of a computer! Secondly, people, especially the younger generation, spend excessive amounts of time on computers. Some people spend hours each day using a computer when they could be doing an activity that actually benefited them. If people spent just as much time helping their community as much time helping their community as they did on the computer, the world would be a much better place to live. Not to mention, it would bring people closer to one another. Computers seem to control peoples' lives and that just isn't healthy. I think people should spend more time living and less time with their faces glued to a computer screen! Lastly, computers are like vampires, sucking away your money. In @DATE1's economy people need to be saving their money for college or even simpler things like a new pair of shoes! Additionaly, at the rate that technology is advances, even the most high-tech computers are out of date in a year or two and a new one is needed. Also, computers' prices are constantly rising. It is very hard to keep up! I strongly believe computers are a waste of money and bring society down. All in all, computers just are a negative attribute in communities across the @LOCATION1. First off they can be dangerous. Secondly, they are too time consuming and, thirdly, computers are too expensive. Computers just simply are a hassle in @DATE1's world."	5	5		10																					
1152	1	"Dear local newspaper, I am writing to you today about how more and more people are using computers. I think that this is great. The reasons why I think so is because it teaches hand-eye coordination, it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and it also allows people to talk online with other people. Keep reading to find out more. The first reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it teaches people better hand-eye coordination, for example, there could be a program for the computer that teaches you to type with your hands and not just your index fingers. You then can learn how to do all this without even looking at the keyboard. Keep reading for more information. The second reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. For example, if you have a project for school and you are doing research on another country, you could use your computer to get more information about their religions or just the whole country in general. You can also use the computer to look up different kinds of people. You can look up people like @PERSON1 from @DATE1's to @PERSON2 who is our presiden now. Keep reading for more information. The last reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it allows people to talk online with other people. For example, you could set up and account on facebook, myspace, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 and start talking to people. You could get to know some kids who live in you neighborhood that you never even knew. Keep reading to find out more. Lastly, I think that more and more people are using computers is agreat thing. They can learn hand-eye coordination, have the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and have the opportunity to talk to other people online. I talked to the people who have just started to use computers and @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people said that they had liked what they had seen. So, I want you to go out there and get a computer and see what you think about it. Thank you."	4	4		8																					
1153	1	"Imagine this: You entered a raffle at your child's school for an all-expense paid trip to @LOCATION1, and you won! You are so excited until you realize you know nothing about @LOCATION1. You don't know what the weather is like, you don't know what kinds of food they eat. You're not quite sure how to prepare for the trip. So you go online and learn everything and anything about @LOCATION1. You pack appropriatly, and you have a great time. All because you had a computor. Computers can help you get a better education, no matter what your age. It also gives you the ability to keep in touch with friends and family, and are necessary for many jobs. Computers help many people learn about different countries and cultures. We know so much more about other places now than we did before computers. But computers can teach you so much more than just different countries. They can teach a whole new language, or help you understand the science lesson better. There are many online colleges where you can learn the lessons online and on your own time which is good if your really busy. The internet is a great way to keep in touch with your friends and family. You can use email, instant messaging, video chatting, or you can make an account on websites like facebook or myspace. For example, my cousin is in the navy, he has been for @NUM1 years, and before I got a facebook, I had lost touch. Now I talk to him all the time. When most people hear computers, the first thing that pops into their head is ""internet"". But that's not all a computer is good for. Nowadays, many jobs use computers. Banks, @CAPS1, teachers, @CAPS2, even cashiers. Computers are no longer a luxury; they have become a necesity. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 jobs require a computer. Computers allow you to type up that book report, or make a very important letter look professional. Computers have changed the world; and once it's changed there's no going back. So, it looks like access to a computer made that trip to @LOCATION1 easier. Clearly, computers have become a part of every day life. You can keep in touch with your friends and use it for your job.

Kids in @ORGANIZATION1 have many projects to do & most of these projects involve writing a paper. Teacher have troble reading other hand writing so it would be helpful for the students to use the computer to print out a very neat paper.

If you walk by a teenager on the internet, now a days you @MONTH1 find them on '@CAPS2'. '@CAPS2' is a website to talk to friends & relatives.

1163	1	"Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that the effects on people caused by computers are positive. Computers can help you connect with far away friends or family members, find great naturistic parks, and help you find local @CAPS8 or exercise equipment. These three reasons will show you that computers are a very important asset to our society in the following passage. To start off, computers can help you connect with faraway friends or family members. According to a recent study, @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 citizens have talked with a friend or family member living across the country via the internet. Another survey done by The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine showed that the computer is the best way to stay connected with a loved one. @CAPS9 best friend @PERSON3 is @CAPS4, and all of his cousins live in @LOCATION4. @CAPS6 told me, ""@CAPS5 the computer was never invented, they would be like ghosts to me."" @CAPS6 relies on the computer to talk to his loved family. Clearly, the computer plays a huge role in reconnecting faraway friends and family members. @CAPS10 would you feel @CAPS5 you loved nature but could never find any amazing parks? @CAPS9 guess is terrible. Luckily, all you have to do is type in ""amazing nature parks"" in a search engine. In about two seconds you should have fantastic results. Many believe that the computer takes away time to enjoy nature, but I believe that @CAPS11 enhances @CAPS11. @CAPS9 sister loves nature, she loves taking pictures of beautiful scenery. However, she lost interest over time. She said, ""I got tired of taking pictures of the same local things everyday."" I typed in nature parks on a search engine, and @CAPS9 sister is back to traveling all over @LOCATION2. Lean @PERSON2, a nature expert says that @PERCENT2 of people who lose interest is because they don't know any new places to go. Also, nature in a @CAPS7 magazine concluded the best way to find nature, is the internet. As you can see, @CAPS5 @CAPS11 wasn't for the internet, barely any one would have the love and passion as most people do today for nature. Who needs excersize? Everyone. Currently, @LOCATION3 is extremely overweight. We need to enroll more @CAPS8 and create more exercise equipment, but @CAPS10 will people find out? Over the computer. According to @PERSON1, @PERCENT3 or @CAPS8 have a website which can be accessed over the computer. ""The best way to get members,"" @CAPS8 @NUM1 @LOCATION5 magazine stated,"" is to create a website online."" @CAPS9 friends dad recently just joined a brand new gym that opened up three days ago. ""@CAPS10 did you find out about @CAPS11?"" I asked. ""@CAPS11 was simple, I just searched local @CAPS8, and @CAPS11 came up!"" Experts say that the computer restricts time to workout, but in all, truth, the computer is the key to the gym. Connecting old friends and faraway family, finding great nature spots, and finding local @CAPS8 and excersize equipment are three very hard things to do. However, these are three things the computer does very well. @CAPS5 reconnecting with loved ones, loving nature, and exercising are bad effects on society, then what is good?"	5	5		10																					
1166	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are helpful once in a while but @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people believe that they are a waste of electricity. Computers aren't beneficial to everyday life overall. When people are on the computer they spend multiple hours on it. This means that they aren't getting enough exercise and that they are harming them bodies. Not only this but people have a tendency to use this machine obsessivly. They spend more attention on the computer and not enough time with your family. Every one knows exercise is important. However, what happens when we don't get enough? Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the @LOCATION1. Heart disease is caused by obesity. That's what happens when you don't exercise. When you are on the computer you are sitting down rather than moving around. This means that your motabolism isn't going and you burn less calories. That is not healthy for anyone. Even people in perfect condition. Gaining weight isn't the only way you can potentially harm your body. When using the computer you have to look at the screen which is with very bright @CAPS3 lights. After looking at the screen for so long your eyes will begin to feel the affects of the lights. Many people say its like staring into a flashlight for an extended amount of time. About @PERCENT1 of the kids at our school wear glasses because of using the computer for to long. That @PERCENT1 is @PERCENT2 more than we had before. We used to have about @NUM3. Like I said before, when you use the computer you use it for an extended amount of time. What about family? They deserve more attention than a machine. To spend more time on the computer than your own flesh and blood isn't right. In a survey an average of @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people said that the spent about eight hours on the computer between work and home, and about an hour with family. The results were more than shocking with all of this in mind, ask your self how useful the computer really is. Sure it's good at researching things quickly but its also good at making people gain weight, making people spend money on glassses and tearing them away from their family members. At the end of the day, the computer isn't very helpful at all."	4	5		9																					
1175	1	"Dear people, Computers have been here for not a very long time and everyday more people buy computers and everyday people use them. As they are used for entertainment, education, and talking with people faraway, they have had a negative effect on people. Let me explain. First of all, as people use computers in the beginning they enjoy it. They go on the @CAPS1, play games, and use it for work. But as they keep using it, they start to get addicted. People are addicted to computers because of the games and being able to go on the @CAPS1. In fact, @PERCENT1 of all the people in this @CAPS3 who owns a @CAPS8, is addicted to computers. That percentage is expected to grow to @PERCENT2 in the next @NUM1 years. Addiction to computers lead to serious issues. People have died because they spent too much time on the @CAPS8 without eating and sleeping. In another newspaper not long ago, it stated that a student attending @ORGANIZATION1, was dropped out for doing so poorly during school. His parent found out that he was addicted to this game ""@CAPS3 of @CAPS4."" This game is right now the most played game on the @CAPS8 in this @CAPS3. Studies state that @CAPS8 addiction is almost as bad as smoking addiction. My second reason why @CAPS8 has a negative effect on people is because of online bullying. People chat on @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and email and people are bullied. A friend of mine recently was emailed with words that hurt his feeling. Online bullying is worse that inteacting bullying. That's because @CAPS9 you say something on the @CAPS8, people don't know who you are. @PERSON1, a proffesor who recently did studies of online bullying says, ""Online bullying has become more severe than contact to contact bullying. People are threatened more and hear more bad words than interacting."" The online bullying and harassment is going to get worse @CAPS9 people don't stop. Also people can get arrested for what they write online. My final reason why computers have a negative effect on people is that people spend too much time on computers and don't exercise @CAPS8 contribute about @PERCENT3 to overweight people. On the @CAPS8, everything is much easier. Instead of mailing, you could e-mail. You can listen to music instead of walking up to the radio and turning it on. You could buy tickets, shop, talk with friends, and have fun just by sitting on a @CAPS8. But this is why people become overweight and obese. @PERCENT4 of the people who use computers are obese or overweight. Peole spend less time interacting with friends and family and enjoying nature. In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people and parents should control their child's time on the computers. Just because of a @CAPS8, many issues rise. So @CAPS9 you think you are addicted, try to make a time schedule for your whole day. Use the @CAPS8 for an hour a time and take rests before using it again. Addiction, online bullying, and becoming overweight is not the only problems of a @CAPS8, there are many more."	5	4		9

These people can do other things like excersising more, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. Spending too much time on the computer is not healthy. On the other hand, if someone kicks you of the computer you can always get that six pack you wanted. There are three main things that can get you in shape. First, taking a light run every night on your community track can get your legs from being fatigued every time you walk up the stairs to having your legs be firm and able to run lap after lap just for a warm up. Every years my dad takes me to the track in @DATE1 and times me for @NUM2 and @NUM3 yard dash, the @NUM4 meter, and the mile. Between the months I train all the way up to @DATE2 then my dad does another assment. I do this training because I play baseball. Weight lifting is another way to get in shape. Some basic excersises are bench pressing, squating, and dumbell curles. There are more challenging excersise but I won't go into that. Once you feel like your in shape, take all of that trainign and put it into a sport. Excersising is not the only thing you can do. Enjoying nature is another option. Just go outside if someone kicks you off your computer. Absoarb everything about the nature. From the squirrls to the tress. If you are in the winter enjoy the snow instedid of being inside @NUM1 playing computer games. But, if that doesn't work out for you then hangout with your family. Hanging out with your family can be thing you can do. Gather your family and plan a trip. You can go to a baseball game, park, or movies anything that will get you away from that computer. That is my opinion why I think people should get excersise, enjoy nature, and spend time with their families insted of being on the computer @NUM1."	4	4		8																					
1210	1	"These have been many advancements on computer technology and there are people who are for it and there are people who are against it. In against it and ill you why. You spend less time exercising which you'll gain weight. Spend less time enjoying nature which means youre lost with anything natural, an spend less time with friends and family which probbaly prove you, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 not saying the computer is a bad thing but to much of it certaintly is. First, you spend less time exercising. you don't exrcise you gain weight, you could do most of the stuff you could of , and you risk health. This is a bad thing because your not yourself anymore and if it goes to far you can't even a move. So if this sounds scary plan your time on the computer, so it doesn't happen to you, time is so limited that we waste it on stuff in computers so think before you go on the computer maybe you can go for a jog outside. Next, you spend less time playing nature. Nature is so beautiful but its being destroyed and we do nothing. There are only a few hundred maybe they said of us these truly help the environment, and if you think then few hundred of thousand people is alot . @NUM1.billion people of earth. Its a crying shame to see something so beautiful die, while most of us do nothing to help. Finaly, you spend less time with friends and family. This is the most important reason of all. The main course if you will of it all your family is so important because there your best friends whole wide world. Your friends important them. Your family might leave you if you your life to the computer if you they you so be carfully. Your friends are dust as important as your friends they both make you laugh. have good times and cheer you up when you upset. Just don't forget that as be gone. Well, there you have it my three reasons for being against work on the computer and they all sound like a good reasons so lets recap it all shall we. First, spend less time exersing, very important. Next spend less time enjoying nature, very important. Finaly less time with friends or family the most important of all. So hoped you enjoyed my essay and you've learned something . So remember to much of good thing is bad and I'll just leave you with . "	4	4		8																					
1219	1	"Dear editor, I have read your past article about how computers can take too much time out of some ones life! time they could be cseing to exercise or on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. This is completly untrue and in many ways actually benerfits society. The internet is d fast d simple way to shorten the time spent doing activites we would already do. Instead of sending d letter to someone to invite them to the @CAPS3 you could just email them. Letters can take weeks and can even get lost while email sends it to them instantly. Also what if the movie sells out or is canceld, don't worry with the internet you can reschedele and buy tickets online. So that doesn't happen again. Suddenly your phone rings, its d call from your best friend saying to turn on the news, but you have to leave to pick up your kids in three minutes. Instead of waiting for the reports to stop talking and , you can check instantly on one of the many news websites and still be early. Have you been dieing to talk to someone haven't seenin a long time. Well with one of the many free websites like @CAPS4 and facebook go can do htat in d heart beat. You can talk to that person and find many race. Also if you've been feeling lonely, like you can't find the right person. With dating sites you can find the perfect person and maybe go to the @CAPS3 with them. Not only does it save time and connect you to other people but it can help you physically. Acording to drishnig at @ORGANIZATION1 people who use computers for at least @NUM1 mintes a day have d @PERCENT1 increase in hand ey corodination relaction time and accuracy. Although home say it's bad for your eyes that is a lie, it was proven by @PERSON1 the @CAPS5, bestead of health who has @NUM2 degres in science and health."	4	4		8																					
1229	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think that computers have a positive or negative affect on people's lives? Well if you think it is negative I am going to show you why it is actually very positive. First, it teaches good hand-eye coordination. Second, it lets people communicate with other people. Third, it can help with school and work. As you can see this is why I believe it is positive. First, computers teach good hand-eye coordination. While you use computers you are improving your hand-eye coordination. One way is that when you are online and you see something you like or want to see even bigger, you move the mouse and click. This helps because you saw something and didn't need to see where you were moving the mouse to click on it. Also it helps because when you are typing a paper you don't need to look at the keys to know what to type. You can look at the screen and move your fingers freely. As you can see this is my first reason as to why I believe computers are positive. Second, computers help people communicate with others. This can be important if you need to talk to someone that lives far away. If someone lives to far away and their is something important then the @CAPS7 is great. You can send people @CAPS3 or even @CAPS4 chat someone. It helps communication so much that you have choices on how you want to talk to someone. Third, it helps people with school and sometimes work. It helps people because they could @CAPS2 projects. This can be helpful to learn about places you didn't even know existed. One time I was wondering what people from @LOCATION1 did to live and survive. Being @CAPS5, I just had to know. I went on the computer and in about a half hour I knew exactly what and how @CAPS5 people did to live and survive. This could also help at work because it your boss is counting on you to have work done, you can use the @CAPS7. As you can see this is my third and final reason as to why I believe computers are positive. In conclusion, I believe that computers are positive for three main reasons. First, they can help to improve hand-eye coordination. Second, they help people communicate with people from other areas. Third, it helps with school and work. So now that you have read this I hope I have shown you that computers aren't bad for us at all. In fact the are the best bet for a better future."	4	4		8																					
1230	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you ever wonder who really invented the ice cream cone while standing there licking one? Well why don't you just rip out your blackberry and find out? That is that great thing about technology. You can talk to friends or family get help, and it is there. Whenever you need it. Have you ever had to move so far away from your best friend that you cried so much someone thought it was raining? Well this is not nessesary because you can now have a webcam in your computer and talk as much as possible. Of course, its out the same as being there with the person, but its pretty close. You can talk whenever, wherever, with the great invention of computers. One other way that a computer benifits talking in other people @MONTH1 be you and your friends can chat. If your parents are out and won't let you get out you can still talk to your friends. Lastly if you are older you can use facebook to find friends you have not seen in a long amount at time. Another reason that the computer and technology are great is because you can get information you need it. Schools practicaly live on computers. Not only the students but teachers too. The teachers assign projects that include going on the computers and finding information all about your topic. Also if you just that you have never heard of before you can go and find out about it. It is great to those all you have to @CAPS2 is clik a buttom and every bit of information is at you fingertips. This can coms in handy when you are in a fight with your friend about who is a better @PERSON1. You can just look up who has gotten more home runs and there you go. You've got a winner! Have you ever been at dinner and someone ask if you have the hockey game score and you friends, husband brothers out his phone and then says @NUM1 to @NUM2 about @NUM3 minutes after you asked? Well that must mean they have internet on their phone. Phones such as blackberrys, @CAPS3, and iPhone all have internet built in. This means when they are in the airport waiting for their plane, they can just play a game or watch some television. To me that is a pretty cool invention. Also people in business and industry have phones with internet built in because they can just look something up at anytime. So this is why I think having technology is good in our society. Ecspecially because they can talk to far away friends and whatever. Kind of information you need you can already have it with a touch of a button. Also, you can have it in stuff such as you phone or in another technology related thing."	5	5		10																					
1236	1	"In my own opinion, computers are great addition to our world. Computers can help people with schoolwork, communication and entertain you in a safe way. Those are the reasons why computers have effects on people around the world. First of all, computers help with a child's schoolwork. For instance, if a student is doing a research paper, the world-wide-web is a helpful place to easily get information from that you can't find in books. In addition if a student forgets, losses, or is missing homework, they can log on the school website and print the paper out. Also, most teachers expect an essay to be @CAPS1 neat @CAPS1 possible. That is hard for some students,  typing it is neat, and everyone can do it. @CAPS1 you can see, computers are very much needed when it comes to school work. Second, computers are a great way to communicate and keep-in-touch with other people. For example, if an employee wanted to speak with a boss, or send some thing to him, he could easily e-mail it to him. Also, if friends wanted to talk with one another, the could instant message each other. If a teacher and a parent of a student had to set up an conference, the teacher could e-mail the parent a time and date. That is why computers are great can easy communication. Lastley, computers provide a safe, fun way or entertainment. Many companies make kid-friendly websites that  go on. For instance, my six year old sister goes on a website that teaches you things in a fun way. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of kindergardeners who go on these websites, do better in first grade compared to those who don't computers are a great way to spend your time. In conclusion, I believe that computers have a great effect on people around the planet. They help with school work, provide east communication, and provide safe educational activities, @CAPS1 you can see, computers are a great addition to our world."	5	5		10																					
1247	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on computers is that I think they are the most helpful thing in our society and it benefits us greatly. Lets say if I wanted to see what across the world looks like, or even what the surface of the moon, mars, venus, jupiter, ect. I could just go onto a computer open or download a program a there it is. Computers also help people express there creativity by here a program that aloose you to draw or biuld. I bet the even help young children became smarter by biulding things on the computer. Another things computers do is open lots of jobs and in a bad econimy people need all the help they can get. With a computer you can keep people alive and bretheing you can find broken bones or tomors, you can biuld briges, homes by making blue prints. The last thing computers help us do is the most importen and that is helps people learn. By making simulation of the titanic a space ships or the floor. They help find information even if its about people you can see people on a computer with a camra for or save a life by fing were they crased on there plane or. Thats why computers are the most helpful thing we have @DATE1 and we should keep learning and progressing to make us more advance and smarter."	4	4		8																					
1254	1	"I do not agree that computers benefits society. There are threes big reason why computers are bad, people are getting to attached and arent spending time with there families. Others are gaining weight because they stay on the computer, and not exercising. Also some people arent getting fresh air not getting out for a walk in a park. Computers are making people shut out their families. When a girl wants to play with her big sister the big sister will just shut out the little sister and continue emailing her friends on the computer. Families need to stick together but when a member of the family from doing a family picnic or other family activities. Computers have addictive games that a person will play and ignore everyone and sometimes a family member can go into depression because he or she is being ignored. Another reason computers are bad is because of health issues. People will get to addicted and be lazy. They will just sit in the computer chair and eat drink bad stuff all day. People would gain weight might ever get dabetes from the weight. If people don't get the exercise they need to stay healthy then they might have heart problems, and many more serious conditions. If your weights gets to extreme then you might not be able to lose weight because your body has gotten tov used to all the weight your heart @MONTH1 not be able to take it. At last but not least people will stop going outside and not go and walk or talk, with friends. People should al least go outside once a day to see nature get air. They should go to the beach relax and relieve all the stress from computer games. Having to much stress is bad for your health you might go into depression. Being on the computer way to much can be bad if you sit in the dark not getting sunlight it can be bad for your eyes. So as you can see there is alot of bad things about computer. Most of the problems or issues all have to do something with someones health. So this is why I think this is bad for the societys benefits. I hope that you will take these reasons to heart. Thank you!"	4	4		8																					
1255	1	"Dear Newspaper, I read an article in the paper @DATE1 debating whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Even though, I love my computer, I know that computers can have a bad effect on people. Computers can cause people to have a lack of exercise, lack of family and friend time, and lack of enjoying nature. Although, computers can help people in so many ways, they can also make things worse for people. In @LOCATION1 the obesity rate has reached an all time high of @PERCENT1. A computer is a non active activity, so if you do use it you get no exersise. One time I played on the computer for two whole hours and gained two pounds. Your health is also very important. When you become overweight you get the risk of diabettes, high colestral, heart failure, liver failure, and more. My uncle is overweight and was just diagnosed with diabettes and now he regrets all the time he gave to his computer. Lastly, people @MONTH1 say that computers create great hand-eye coordination. Computers might do that but is the hand-eye coordination ever used? No, because that person is too busy playing on the computer can you see how computers can effect your health? Eighty eight percent of @CAPS1 voted that the most important thing in their life was their family and friends. The other twelve percent said that their computer or cell phone is their most important thing in life because they cannot live without it. Not spending time with your Family and friends is an awful thing to do. When my mom lost contact with one of new friends, @CAPS2 regretted not spending so much time with them. Also, if you do not spend time with people it could lead to socializing problems. If the only thing you do is talk to people on the computer you develope speech problems. My neibor, who I have never talked too never really came out of his house he always seemed to be on his computer, and no one over. One day someone came over and they started talking outside. When I overheard a little of their conversation I could the words he had trouble saying and he did not have a good vocabulary. Lastly, you can also develope relationship problems. Not being able to see a real relationship. That is why computers can have a negative effect on not only you, but your family and friends too. In our daily lives we observe nature, and it's beauty. Spending time on the computer instead of enjoying nature is awful. For example, if I was to not go outside for a whole day, and I got to spend my time on the computer I would be miserable. Nature is a gift that should be given to everybody. Also the @CAPS3 air is good for your body. Without @CAPS3 air you would be taking in chemically changed air, which is not good for your body. Lastly, everyone reads on the internet about @CAPS4 warming but why do we not take action! If you spend your time on the computer you would not be able to help nature. I remember when I read about @CAPS4 warming on the computer. So I took action and cleaned our lakes. That is why computers have a negative effect on people. Computers can be great in so many ways but it is how much time you give to your computer that is bad.That is why computers have a negative effect on our society."	6	5		11																					
1257	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know computers are a major part of our society. Ever since the first computer they have been improved so much, that now you dont even need a keyboard. Having computers benifits our society because it allows us to learn about technology, and how to memorize when we start to type a lot. You have an opportunity to learn about things you like. And @CAPS2 a plus you can communicate with people from all over the world. Every day you learn something new! Learn a lot now, and you will be better off down the road! That's all teachers say. We'll computers do just that. Computers can teach us! The more you use a computer the more you know about it. You can learn about how it's made and the vireses it can have. The computers can also teach you in a way you might never have thought of. When you sit at a computer and type you start to memorize where certin letters, numbers and punctuation are. Now you @MONTH1 ask what about the little kids? How do they learn from computers? They sell millions of games for kids to help them learn even before pre-school. In fact @PERCENT1 of all kids who start off playing educational games before entering pre-school are ahead. How great is that? Kids and adults both go on computers. For kids when they go on computers they are doing things they enjoy. For example my brother is really into parcore. Parcore is when a bunch of people do flips, off of buildings, walls, or anything they can find. When he goes on the computer he looks up different parcore tricks he can do or learn to do. For adults they use it for work. They to, might have to look up things for a meeting they might have, or a buisness that they might have to work with. Using computers could be fun for some and work for others. But eather way they are using computers ina way that can help them down the road. Communication is one of the main reasons people use computers. There is e-mail, @CAPS3, twitter, facebook, myspace, and so much more.If you were to ask ten randum people on the street and asked them if they have a facebook @PERCENT2 of them will say yes. Communication is key when it comes to buisnesses and relationships. For relationships like family and friends having a computer to talk from if they are far away is great. Even for buisnesess using those internet communications you can communicate to people if your going to be late. Computers have been and always will be a huge part in our society. The computers help us in ways like learning communication, and work, knowing that this technology can help us suesede is great."	5	4		9																					
1262	1	"Dear local newspaper, Have you ever noticed how a lot of people are always on their laptop or their computer? Well, when they're on the web they don't get exercise at all. I have three seasons why people should spend less time on their computers. People could get sick, probably forget a lot of stuff, and never have the future that they have always wanted. My first reason why people should spend less time on their computer is people could get sick. For example, their are a lot of people who just eat and eat and only use their computers. Some people get obese by doing this. When they do they go on the internet to find out how to lose weight, but they never do it. Some people go on the internet so they can have a surgery because they're so fat. They think their is a cure for obese on the internet, but the truth is that the only cure their is by doing. Some exercise because that is the only cure they will get if their not on their computer. When people are surfing the web they forget a lot of stuff. Some people almost spend their whole day or even life on their computer that they don't know what else to do, but surf the web. What I have seen happen is that some people forget where they're at or who the even are. They also forget who their family is and never contact each other at all. This isn't good people. My third and final reason is no future. Sure some people apply for jobs at home from the computer, but the only problem their is that they don't get enough exercise and paid as well as the people who work outside their house. Some people wanted to do something about their life's and how they can't because they are addicted to their computers. Some people have to go to thearapy so they can stop going on the internet. Do you want that? Getting sick, loss of memory, and no good future are three reasons why people should stop using computers and start getting some exercise. If I were addicted to my pc I wouldn't get on education and I wouldn't be writing this letter right now. Get some exercise. Together we can make a change or find a cure."	4	4		8																					
1269	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that several people are concerned with the technology boom and computer overuse. I can assure you that technocal upgrades only harm our people. Email and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 have only given us a decrease in our already terrible communication skills. Furthermore, we spend less and less time exercising outside because we are trapped in a technology revolution filled with inaccurate information. Why are we hurting ourselves instead of helping? @CAPS2 is very clear that our teens are growing up with no communication skills. I remember reading a persuasive essay and realizing that they used @CAPS3 @CAPS4 based language. @CAPS2 is ridiculous that we are forgetting how to use the proper grammar of the @CAPS7 language. Furthermore, I have also observed that when my friends talk they use slang terms like ""@CAPS8"" and ""@CAPS9"". I understant that computers after a faster and much easier way to communicate but we definetley can't forget the work of @CAPS10 . With the , people who should hope that they don't become a biggest loser contestant say @CAPS2, but, if they continue to mind on their then they will join the millions of obese. Americans I think that when people at their computer they tend to bring junk food with them and for! contrast to this from spending these hours with @ORGANIZATION2 instead of Exercising and let you creative wild would citizen rather pay for a computer or the vast, free, and gorgeous? Furthermore, people are wasting their important attention. A fact that over three of the information in isnt reliable therefore. Also, statistics show that nearly @PERCENT1 of students use to. These statistics also display that when students use these sites they clearly will score lower than a student who did the seemingly ""daunting"" task of looking for the reasearch in a textbook. What is so daunting about @CAPS2? Obviously, nothing is overwhelming. @CAPS2 is only pleasure when the student will get a phenomenal grade and their surronding classmates won't. Furthermore, I ask you why are people flooding their brains with unrealiable information? In conclusion, the effects computers have on people are very negative. Due to this, many people have no communication skills. They are also more likely to become less obese and if that's not enough they are hurting themselves because they are obsessed with inaccurate information. I urge people to dump @PERSON1 and @CAPS11. PC and start seeing @ORGANIZATION2 Nature! She's beautiful!"	5	6		11																					
1271	1	"The computer is a great achivement of man. It is very useful for finding information fast, and has many other capabilities. Even though computers are every useful tool in the modern world. It has negatively afect to people. People aren't getting enough exercise because they are always on the computer. Along with that they are being socialy active. The lost and probably most negative effect is the exesive amount of freedom people get on the internet. Exercise is probably are one of the most important thing to live along and healthy life. People should be atleast taking along walk everyday. If people are sitting infront of a all day there will be much moreover people. People shold be for healthy life style, not with computers around every corner. People are also losing the ability to interact. Life is becoming dull. Every one is either texting someone. The biggest surprise is that there is online dating. This is horrible because you might be dating some crazy person. If someone think there inlove and when the cople meets the dont know how to interact, then there is a real problems. Even when you are just on the computer. You could use that time to socialize with friends and family. Last is the emerce amount of freedom that any are has with computers. There are lots of bullies people who want to sell you stuff, and people who want your personal info. Many kids sign up for something like facebook, but they're not cairful. They put staff like there adress and don't pay attention who how is sending them friend request. Computers have way to much negative effectson people. It would be great if some how the system could be improved, and people need to be more responsible. People should wont to get out and interact. Take a walk. Just dont let computers control your life."	4	4		8																					
1272	1	"Have you ever had a computer? I'm sure if you was around my age you know how fun it is to explore the internet. It's a brain tht gives you information about everything. But, it’s not good for you to just drop everything and go to your computer. Things like exercise, socializing and homework matter. If you don't exercise you begin to gain weight, if you don't socialize you'll be an lonely person. Homework is the most important, because it'll help you really well through life. It's fine to go on the computer time to time, but not for hours. Exercising will keep you in shape and if you plan on playing sports, you should jog a couple times of day. Some people make you feel bad if your bigger than they are. For example, I knew someone who was a little big for his age, but people didn't like him and they always made fun of him. I would suggest that you should keep your mind on more important things than a computer. Do you have ant friends? Or did all of them leave you because you wouldn't stop surfinh the web on your computer. As a teenager you should be socializing with your friend at the movies, arcaded and parties. Not in the house on the computer. Especially with your family, because you never know if they're going shopping for you ask me that's selfishness. Every since you got your computer have you been receiving bad grades? Education is the most important thing you need in your life. Without it you can't be or do anthing, because you wouldn't have a degree to get a job. If you don't have a job how can you pay for electrity bill for your computer? Education can get anywhere, if you want it. If not you can be a homeless guy in the street holding a computer that doesn't work. Do you still think this has a positive effect on people? You should talk to parents about getting their child an computer. For example, tell the parent to put a password that only she/he knows, that way he has to ask you to sign onto it everytime we needs it. Blocks off things that you think is important for your child., especially if your child is into sex. That is why I don't think it gives people the right kind effect they might need."	4	5		9																					
1276	1	"Dear editor I agree that people do spend to much time on their computers. An if you read this you would see my reasons why. One of them will be about exercising. The two others will be about your friends and family. So read my reasons and by the end I hope I made my point. All right like I said first we will talk about what the lack of exercise because of always being on the computer. Did you know that from being on the computer all the time you lose focus on exercising anymore? Of you eating an @CAPS1 not exercising, because your worried about the computer. The weight that you put on you know just doesn't burn off by themselves. So by you not burning off that fat you just keep gaining and gaining. By the time you know it you'll be over weigh and wish you didn't spend all that time on that computer. How that I'm explaining about your of exercise. Where going to talk about your you bring on the computer all you would with your family. For example your family would want to go out but you say no because of that computer @CAPS1 parents would @CAPS1 they would because your lack of communication with the family. I've got my two reasons across let me get my third. Of you bing on that computer you have been adicted, but you just don't lose contact with family, but also with friends. You loving that computer so much you probably quite all your like the basketball, softball, and more teams because you thought it took to much of your computer time. In the end you would lose probably alot of frienships. @CAPS1 your boyfriend or girlfriend would dump you. So now that you read this I hope I got my point out to you, about what a computer can do to you in the end."	4	4		8																					
1278	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, my opinion on the effects computers have on people is that I think the computer is good for people not great but its good for many reasons, for now I have three reason why its good, my reasons are, search new places meet new people, when people have nothing to do, and teenagers that cant be without the computer. My first reason is about searching new places and meeting new people. People that have computers can go on google and search for a place they want to go and there they meet new people and that way they dont have to be on the computer that much they will be too busy with their new friends. My second reason is when people have nothing to do. If people have nothing to do they can always invite friends over and on the computer they watch movies without going to the movie theater and they dont have to pay. All you could do is download it. And also thre are many websites of movies. My last reasong is about how teenagers cants be without the computer. teenagers are teenagers they must have technology. If yu take the computer away from them they went do enything else. That will be even worse because if you tell them to go outside they wont do it same will. Maybe what you can do is let them use the computer but they can use it outside only if its a laptop. This is my opion on the effects computers have on people."	4	4		8																					
1287	1	"To begin with, The learning ability people get from it has improved. The @CAPS1 source is very helpful to many people. The communication is much easier than talking on the phone. I believe that computers benefit the society in many different ways. First of all, children and people at home and at school use computers for learning purposes. In some grades at school there is a special typing program that helps improve typing skills. There are also hard drive discs that you can play with to help you enhance on your reading skills. It is just a way to make learning fun for young kids. Another great way to learn online is going to websites that have sample math problem and print the sheet out to practice. They are great ways to help learning. Secondly, the computer has many more ways to benifit someone. They are helpful for getting your local weather. In the winter you can see if your school has cancelled in seconds. Often I get projects where it calls for me to do research on a specific topic and it is very easy to look up simple information. The computer also has different links that are helpful for writing a paper, making a power point presentation, and excel spread sheet. All of those resources can either help graphing results for science class or even typing up a paper for @CAPS2. They are useful ways to make life easier. Lastly, computers tend to make communication a little easier. For me, when I'm out sick from school I like to tell my teachers by emailing them and even asking if I can make up any work using facebook, aim, myspace, and skype are all fun and fast ways to communicate with friends. All of the websites pretty much do the same thing but different people like diffrent sites that their friends are on you can email friends and family who live far away and even close. It's a way to get back and forth to eachother. In conclusion, you have heard the different ideas and I consider computers as a benifit. It helps learn, communicate, and most of all do the important things that we need."	5	5		10																					
1288	1	"I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. The three reasons I think this, is because computers enhance our hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find out information about a certain topic. They also allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. Computers, in fact, increase our hand-eye coordination. The usage of both the screen and the keyboard allow us to look only at tha sceen while typing on the keyboard. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill to have when excersising by playing sports or working out, which is also important and very good for our bodies. If you want in to apply for a job in, for example, an office, and you started stumbling and acting clumsy, then you @MONTH1 be looked at differently if you were organized and knew what your doing. This is why hand-eye coordination is important to people. Computers also have the amazing ability to search the world wide web. This gives us the ability to make millions of searches for any given topic. For example, In fifth grade I did a research project on @LOCATION2. Without all the useful information I found on the computer. I would have never been able to learn evrything I did. As most of the world already knows, there was a devestating earthquake in the small country of @LOCATION4. Computers was one of the ways that helped spread the word and get everyone to start helping and sending supplies and food to the victims. Also, if a family is thinking about going somewhere for a vacation, they can take care of most of the help on the computer. They could buy flight tickets, book a room at the hotel, and even get a rental car for when they land. This is what my family did on our vacation to @LOCATION1 and everything turned out perfectly all thanks to the computer and being able to do everything online. This is how the computer can help you research any topic. Lastly, you can use the computer to communicate with people that live far away and you rareley ever see. For example, my grandparents live in @LOCATION3, so I use video chat to talk to them since I only get the chance to see them one every two or three years. Also when my dad goes on buisness trips to other states or even something out of the country, we use instant messaging or video chat to keep in touch. Lastly, if you have friends or family who are fighting for america in @LOCATION5 right now, you can also use a video chat to communicate with them. So these are all my reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They help with hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find information on any topic through the internet, and lastly, the allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. These are my reasons and I hope you agree with me that computers have a positive effect on people today."	5	5		10																					
1291	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of my local news paper: @CAPS2 you believe this garbage that the so called expert are saying about computers? I sure hope you don't! They are saying that computers are health risks because to many people are on them and not exercising, well if you risk me the users should know when to stop. And well when it comes to interacting with family the parents should set limits. Also computers are very convient, if you need information on a topic right away. So there far I think computers are not the one's at, in this perdevment. Exercising is somthing a perosn should have the ambition to do. @MONTH1 people don't have this they spend their day on the computer. they claim its not their faut. the computer is a you to play it. I read just last week that someone actolly told her press they it is not fault her over weight. Thats ! So the only person at full. for not getting the the gamer. As us family interaction goes, all up to the parents the use the parents are in control over they child and if they are that their kid doesn't spend enough time. The operator should have the will power to know when enough is enough and lay down the and set limits!. If we didn't have computers at home it would be a. Kids relie on computer them quick, accurate information. With not them the parents should their child to and from the library, and the time. And lets not forget the internet easy. So in conclusion computers are the way to go they are not the cause or however luck of exrcising at fault. Its not the computers fault familys. And they are just so convenit so clearly computer are good to have! I truly hope by the letter you agree with my oppinion."	4	4		8																					
1292	1	"Dear local newspaper, I have some arguments to tell you how computers aren't all bad. One you can use them to get information for a project, talk to your friends, or learn about something you have never known before. My first argument is that most people use there computer to get information for a project they have to do for class. For example, they could need information for a country like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. There are many way you can get this information. So if you didn't have a computer where could you get all this information. If you get it from a it might not have what you are looking for your project. Had the computer here a bigger range of knowledge then a have. My second example, is you can talk to your friends you haven't seen or talked to in a long time. There are many ways you can do this On @CAPS1, @CAPS2, twitter, yahoo. You could always because it is always better to make new friends. Even better to a family member. I know it is alot better to talk to a family because they already know you. Finally, it is always better out something you never knew before or something you have been wondering about. But you could always go on google, ask or wikipedia. They can all help you you have been looking for. But that doesn't mean you can't find it in a book either. They are chalk full of answer and ideas that can help you. My conclusion, is that you can always find ways to get the answer you need. But that also doesn't mean that you should be sitting on the computer when you could be going outside, or playing with our friends. And nothing is better then spending your time outside. So use the time on the computer better. Then go out side and enjoy the outdoors."	4	4		8																					
1295	1	"More and more people use computers, they love computers for place that are far or the news. Computers are good for everyone in this world. Know one can live with out computers. There's others dat don't like computer for nothing. I know that there's family or friends that be having computers they write each others like in myspace u could have friend from everywhere or family's. But computers are spending to many times on their computers."	2	2		4																					
1298	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently discovered that you are debating the computeres have on people. In my opinion I would think they have a neutral effect on people. In this day and age computers are used for many things. Research, communication act. maybe the reason young people so much time in the computure is because they have a lot of home work on the computer, ""@CAPS2 this"", ""@CAPS2 that"", people don't relize to pass we have to go on the computure. And for adults when you work with big companies you work with people all around the world. Instead of fixing to all these meetings you can simply do it over webcam. Yes, I see your concern that people spend too much time inside on their computure but what about people who love to read or play music, they could spend hours upon hours practicing or reading. What is the difference? And you never know maybe being on the computure for someone is lik a sport for another. Computoras are just about anywhere houses, schools and even crime & medical labs. Computure or a prime source of the data base, of @CAPS4, criminal records and so much more. With out computures how could catch the bad guy or catch the cancer before it's too late. Computure are key in many things. in the end you could go all day about the pros & cons of computures. But there so key in major aspects today, the pros out weigh the cons."	3	4		7																					
1306	1	"Dear editor, I think that computers are a good thing to have in the house. They're very helpful and entertaining. For example, they make @CAPS1 easier to keep in touch with far away friends and family, they help you learn things or know the important news, and their also very entertaining to people of all ages. This is why computers are one of the most valuable things to have in your home. One of the many things a computer can help you with is keeping in touch with family members of friends that live far away. Computers can serve that purpose because someone can use facebook, twitter, or skype when using one. ""I love facebook, because I can keep in touch with my family members in the @LOCATION1,"" says @PERSON2. Also, researchers say that people who have facebook, skype, or twitter accounts become closer to their families than people who don't. A computer can be used for educational purposes also. Many people like to use educational computer games to prepare their elementary - schoolers for school. ""@CAPS1's fun and gets my son prepared!"" says a local mother as she talks about a computer game. Studies show that computer games are @PERCENT1 better at preparing a child for school than textbooks and worksheets. One of everyone's favorite reasons for keeping a computer in the house is for entertainment. When on a computer, anyone can play cards, chess, pinball or game websites like addictinggames.com, go on youtube.com to watch videos, or much much more. ""I like to spend some of my free time on addictinggames.com,"" says @PERSON1. Also, after taking a poll. I found out that @PERCENT2 of kids and teens prefer online games to board games. As you can see, there are many reasons why having a computer in the house is important. There are also many more than what I listed. However, I think the main ones are to keep in touch with friends and family, to use the computer for educational purposes, and for entertainment. I'm very grateful for the computer in my house because I use @CAPS1 everyday for those purposes, and so does everyone else in my family. A computer is one of the most important things in the average home."	4	4		8																					
1314	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever trully marveles at the computers in our generation today? Have you seen all the interesting and amazing things that computers allow us to explore? Computers have been thought to advance our society because of its abiliyt to show websites containing rast and diverse research. However, let me ask you this - have you ever wondered if computers actually ruin the life someonehas? Well, people who use computers are drown into them, and they ignore the necessary physical activities one can get from being outside. Also, people who spend their time infront of a computer screen don't inteact as much with friends and family as they nirmally would. Also, one major threat that teens and children face while on the internet are people who try to talk to them online and could become a dnager to the children. In order to help the wee-being of people, we need to realize the negative effects of computers! If oyu were to talk in the park or even visit a field, you would most likely someone enjoying the outdoorss. When I say that @CAPS1 mean like playing soccer or fotbol, or playing frisbee, @CAPS2 who do this rather than sit inside staring ata computer, help their body stay healthy. When you are on the computer, no healthy activity is involved. Would you rather see yourself healthy and active or lazy and sluggish? Well. when the summertime comes, my friends and I usually go to the feild to play a game of soccer. Also, we sometimes go to the beach and enjoy the cool, freshing water in the pool. Not to mentio, we even find activities to do in the cold, freezing winter such as sledding nad snowboarding. @CAPS2 need tog et out and chair, pry their eyes from the computer screen and go out and smell the fresh air. The feeling of being outside will raise your spirits and sgift you from a person in a trance to a person that feels alive! Also . ahve you ever gone gone home and just retreat to your room for some quite? Then you decide to go on the computer to get away from your troubles. ""@CAPS3 is ready, a family member informs you; however, you don't respond because you enjoy the computer so much. Computers interfer with your connection to family members and friends. In addition, many people sit in a tence like state while at the computer, blocking out any outside communication. Computers do not help families come toigether they separate them. This vcreates and unhealthy family, which is bad because people need to have a strong connection with family. Studies show that the average time a person spends on the computer is five hours! This pretty much takes up a lot of time, so families can't spend time with one another. One important problem that children and teens face are @CAPS2 oover the intenet are people known as ""child predators."" @CAPS4 people usually seek to hurt a child by getting information out of them and meeting them. Research shows that @PERCENT1 of children encounter @CAPS4 ""child predators; would you want to see your child be hurt by @CAPS4 horrible people? Computers are the reason, a with the internet for @CAPS4 accurances. Children and teens need to be protected from this major threat! In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people and thier lives. First, they don't allow people to be active and go outside. "	5	5		10																					
1318	1	"Dear editor, I agree with having computers in our homes. I think that computers are good because of these reason. The computer has a-lot of information that you can look up. Also the computer can save a-lot of important things you need. Then you can comunicate with people far away. I think that a computer is a really good thing becouse you can look up varius things like something about someones life that way important. You can look up a website that tells you about a word or a car that you need to learn about for school or work. You can look up something that happed a long time ago @NUM1 or @DATE1 that was a. Then you could look up a your family tree and send out who you are routed to one how was or family in the past time, you could look up your book account or your e-mail on the computer to. So this is one reason that I think a computer is good for. Another reason why I would think that a computer is a good thing for anyone it can save a-lot of important things. Some you could save important from your past. Also you need save your reports for your school or work. Then you can save pictures from when you you on occation. You could favorite websites to your favorites so you can go to it any time you want to. This is another reason why I think computers are a good thing. One last reason why I think that computers are a good thing is because you can comunicate with people far away. You can have family that just went on and you can keep in touch with them through your e-mail, myspace, facebok, ect. You could vidio chat with your friends or family that lives in a diffrent place. You could go in chats with your co-workers or your boss for a meeting. This is anothe reason why I think computers are a good thing. So as you can see this is why I think computers are a good thing because of you can look up things, how you can save important things also because you can go and comunicate with your friends. So this is why I think computers are a good thing."	4	4		8																					
1319	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effect of computers are that, it depends on how much you use the computer. But I think the computer has a possitive effect on people. Why because it has made us kids homework easier to do, and fun sites you can check out. Even for adults when they need to look up something important they can automatically find it in the computer. First reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is because it makes @CAPS1 homework easier, instead of getting it from a book I can get it from @CAPS1 computer. Trust me it's much easier than reading all those types of books when you have a computer. Then you can just type in what you want and it would automatically pop up for you. For example, when you have an essay to right about @PERSON1 @LOCATION1. All you have to to is go to @CAPS2.com and all types of past @CAPS2 would show up. Then you go to search and put in @LOCATION1 then all this @CAPS2 of him comes out. So you get the right information that's an easy A+ for you. Second reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is all the sites you can go on and play games or go on youtube, or myspace. It's alot of things you can do on a computer to have some fun. For, example, say you don'@CAPS3 want to play your game or watch @CAPS3.V, or go outside. What do you do, get on your computer. So you can check your myspace page or watch funny videos or maybe talk to some of your friends online. Think about it, you can'@CAPS3 do none of those things on your @CAPS3.V or your game and especially not outside so that's why I think a computer has a positive effect on people. Lastly, I think the computer has a positive effect on people because even adults like to get on computers. Half of every adults job has an computer that they have to use either to cash a check on a computer or teachers to put in grades and scientist to look up different experiments. For example a teacher alway's have to use their computer to put in grades or see what us kids need help on or how far we got and how far behind we are. So it makes it easy on adults as well. In conclusion, those were the reasons why I think computers has a positive effect on people."	5	4		9																					
1322	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 do you feel about the advantages and disadvantages of owning a computer? I think that computer help in many different ways. Computers teach hand-eye cordination, helps us learn, and we can even talk online with friends and family. Do you ever think about @CAPS1 you computer can help you phisicly? Many parents state that, ""@CAPS2 spend to much time on the computer!"" but what they don't know is that the computer is teaching them hand-eye cordination. Parents argue that kids wagh more because they sit inside on the computer, but if they do sertain things to limit the @CAPS2 like only goind on sertain games, limiting there time on the computer, or making them play outside the same amount of time they were on the computer the kids could be learning while still staying fit. This is why a computer could be a way important part of a childs life if used properly. What is you method of learning? Maybe you read books, go to school or even watch @CAPS3. But what if you arn't at school, or have any books around? What if your @CAPS3 isn't telling you what yo need to know? Well, with a computer you can look up almost anything with just few clicks of a button. If you don't have time to take a trip to you local library to a book, @CAPS1 would you learn? As teen who attends school I know that I would not be able to do a lot of my school work and projects without my computer. A lot of the at home jobs today require computers, and without the computers the job would not be getting done. This is why I think computers benifit our society and knowledge. Does everyone you know live in one are? Probably not this is why websites like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are getting more and more members each day. Ther internet helps us keep intuch with relatives friends and ever helps us meet new people. I know that the internet helps me heep in tuch with old friends."	5	4		9																					
1323	1	"Dear, @CAPS1-@ORGANIZATION1 Computers... they are sometimes bad and sometimes good they're like people. Computers are helpful on finding information, making your work less difficult. But at the same time there not so healthy to you and your family. Computers have so much information that the news paper in the future will no longer be known. Newspaper will no longer be thrown at your front porch. Because of computers instead of getting info of what happen yesterday in what area you live with the computer you can find out what intersting things happen yesterday in the whole world. But thanks to computers life is one step easier if someone had a science project. About as an example cells and with that computer it will help a lot more than you think no need to write all slopy just type of cell's were you can find in the internet, print done it just makes life way easier than just writing drawing finding info of cells in book that waste good time to go outside and play with friends and family. Computer like I said are sometimes bad like people and it also like a drug. Because look at computers when people go on website like, myspace, twitter, facebook, communicating website or game website, theres whay to much to name. Its a drug cause you to stay on it day to night you'll get stuck to it and can't get enough of it and some people won't stop and it hurts there family, friend and especially health, like drugs they cause all the same thing. I think I proved my point of why computers are sometimes bad and sometimes good like people."	4	4		8																					
1327	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to express my opinion on computers benefit to society. I believe that computers are very useful tools for learning and communication, but people today over use that power. You know what I mean @NUM1 gamers, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 addicts. Or those who will do anything just to spend time on the computer. People like the @CAPS4 do not spend much time with family members, or friends, or even just outside. They do not get enough exercise, and frankly, abusing computers is not good for your life, physically or socially. Some people are working all day, leaving early in the morning and getting back late, so that they rarely spend time with those they love. But if you are hooked on the computer, as so many of us are, you @MONTH1 just not spend enough time with family and friends. Using a computer isn't exactly a social thing. One person with a mouse, a keyboard, and a monitor. You @MONTH1 say ""@CAPS5, but there are also online social networks."" @CAPS5, but how often do you even see those people in real life? Computers can take precious time away from you that you could be sharing with your family and friends. That certainly does not benefit society. A major fault in computers is that you have to be indoors. So you cannot be online chatting, or playing a game, or checking your email, outside while enjoying the beauty of the outdoors. Sure you could use a laptop outside but are you really enjoying the outdoors? Computers and outdoors go together like chocolate milk and fillet mignon - not well. That is the reason why pine tree's don't have outlets (although now you never know what they'll do next). Another side effect - that goes allong with the aforementioned statement about computers and outdoors - of computers is the lack of exercise. Once again, it is rather difficult to use a computer and jump rope at the same time. When you live as a computer vegetable, your not getting enough exercise as you could or would be. Another reason computers could lower your quality of life. Now, really, if you use the computer sparingly, and only when you needed to, or when it is nessecary you would really have none at these ""side effects."" But face it, the ruth is, computers can be addicting. Wether it's waiting for a friend to come online or your trying to get to level @NUM2 of ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8"", they can get you hooked. The idea of this article is not to prevent you from using computers, but to make sure you use them like you eat double fudge brownies with walnuts and cream cheese frosting-springly. So, now you know, computers when used to much, at obsesive amounts, are similar to drugs in the way that they are so addicting. As long as you use them correctly, they are a very, very valuable tool to be used, but over used, can be problem causing, and even prevent you from spending time with family and friends, getting exercise and even spending time outdoors. I know you certainly will agree."	5	6		11																					
1328	1	"I believe computers are a good thing for several reasons. Three reasons why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. You can also use them to meet new people. Finally you can also use them for planning. My first reason why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. My parents use e-mail all the time. They taly to my grandparents, then friends, and even use it to arrange events with other people. My use it when people are hurt and I know some people use it to learn about magazine subscription and other thing to buy. My favorite thing is that my parents use e-mail to talk with my grandparents about my birthday presents. My second reason why computers are a good thing to have is that you can use them to meet new people. I know there are alot of websites that match you with someone based on what you like and do. You can also use e-mail to talk to friends and they @MONTH1 want to see you again and you can meet people that way. Therea are thousands of ways to meet new people. You can use chat websites or you can use sites like facebook or myspace. My third and final reason why computers are good is that you can use them to plan a vacation or move dining reservations. For example me and my family went on vacation to @LOCATION1, and my mom made all the reservations from our computer at home. My parents aren't the only ones. Many people travel dening vacation, and propbably @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people use a computer to reserve hotels. I also wanted to take you to the other side without computers. If we don't have computers we would have do send mail through the post office and by the time that gets to your house someone could have new baby could have been born. Plus we would also find up doing bills and taxes without computer software. My parents life and my life would be very hectic if we didn't have computers. Once again I believe computers are good and that more than half of america use them. I believe this because you can use them to talk to other family that @MONTH1 be far away. You can meet new people through online dating services. Then theres the always helpful panning part, so you go online and reserve a hotel on dinner at a resturaunt. Plus if we didn't have computers we would have to do bills and taxes the old fashioned. My where you add up and subtract and divide. It's alot less words if you use a computer."	4	4		8																					
1340	1	"Computers are an incredibly important part of many peoples lifestyles. They can give us wonderful facts and news that would otherwise be hard to obtain. Computers also allow people an easy way to communicate with friends and family without using a phone. Lastly computers are an incredibly useful tool for writing. One of the most beneficial parts of computers is that you can find out whats happening anywhere in the world. For instance, I could do a search engine on recent disaters and find hundreds of articles on @CAPS1 and other recent news. However you could also find out interesting facts like how many have chosen to sail around the world in the past ten years. But this is just one of the many uses a computer has. Critics @MONTH1 think that the use of computers interferes with spending time with your friends and family. But computers can actually do the opposite. There are many websites that allow you to talk safely to people. Some of those websites are facebook and chatme.com. Did you know that you can even video chat with people. It's just like youre right there with you. Incredibly, unlike calling people and using a phone using these websites is free and open to anyone. This brings me to the last point. Computers are great writing tools. They allow you to write efficiently and neatly. Also, programs liek microsoft word allow you to spell check your work. However one of the most usefull qualitus of a program like word is that it allows you to change your work and add sentences or words wherever you want. Its you can see computers are a usefull and beneficial part of society. They allow people to easily stay informed on world news. Secondly computers allow easy and safe communication between people and lastly they are usefull for writing papers such as writing prompts. I hope that by reading this, you can now see some of the many uses of computers."	4	4		8																					
1346	1	"Dear local newspaper from my point of view, computers are good to society and to the people because they help you communicate with people in other places or with your family or friends or meet with people from other country and you can become frinds. They are also good because they help to develop cordination on your hand with your eye, and they are helpful because you can buy things online. First of all I think that people who know how to use a computer can communicate with their family in other county or meet new people who then become friends with you and you can even meet them after you know them very well. You can even talk with your family through the computers and you won't spend that much money on expensive international phone calls. Secondly the computers are helpful because they help you cordinate your hand and your eye. This helps you because if you are a kid you have a big project; You will be able to finish it on time. From your point of view you can actually se were I'm going because after you finish the project you can go play with your friends and family on the patio or backyard. The hand cordination can help you develop mentally sight. Thirdly using computers is good because it helps you buy things online, the computer can help you buy thing like a clothes, shoes, cars, house and, many others, anything you need you can buy it online. In conclusion I think people should think about using computers more often either to buy things, to meet people or to cordinate body parts don't you agree with me?"	4	4		8																					
1349	1	"To the Newspaper, Computers are obviously needed in society. They can be used as a valuable learning tool, help communication, and teach skills that will be used for life. Students like myself of often use computers for many reasons. Our teacher also encourage us to use computers. All projects require research. For example, last week in social students I researched the amendments to the constitution. I went to @ORGANIZATION1- on the and sound a storage of information on the @NUM1 for my project on wehter capital punishment is and unusual. I found from this database that not onlt is it all lawed for that reason but the @LOCATION1 got from the international council of human rights for allowing it. Without the internet, which is instanly to carry the newest. most recent information I would have now to go find banks published recently enough carry this significant fact. It would mre costly taken over two houses just to find the same information that five minutes using a computer. The internet can millions websites and photo on a wide variety of toys and faster than any other method. As well as for research, school use computers to type papers. This moves than easier to road the teacher and provides useful tools like spell check. Also, using the internet you can access all of the communicate benefits of using computers. E-mail, @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are just @NUM2 of the commnly used websites on computers they make talking to friends and family easier and faster then ever. Last @DATE1 my friend on a business trip the was for @NUM3 weeks she missed him a lot @CAPS4 mom let @CAPS4 she was able to would have a telephone call. It consoled @CAPS4 for the @NUM4 days wasn't able to see @CAPS4 while still being amazing quick. Computers allow people to interact with other people at once even when they can't be with that person for whatever reason. This communication element is very important just like how they will help for the future. Many jobs involve the usage of a computer mastering how to use the computer before. It is needed has many advantages. If we already know how to use them we don't need to worry about learning in life. Also in the closer future computer will be used in high school and college for helping paper researching and morw it will be faster and easier for us it we have knowledge of how to do these things. Eventualy if can read the benefits are counters. As you can see, computers and the internet can any benefits iur society school can use them for many projects and learning People can talk to others virtually when it is not possible face to face finally, it can help run the future. In conclusion compare use be encouraged."	6	5		11

In my opinion, computers have a positive effect on people. The first reason is computers teach hand eye coordination. Without this coordination, people would not survive. The users be over very quickly. The computer makes us use these muscles so we can live happily. @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 recently took a survey at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, agree computers are the main source of hand eye coordination. Dr. @DR1 expert in relationship to humans said, ""People without computers cant do what others can. They are unable to have fast reaction time."" To sum it up computers help with hand eye coordination. The second reason is computers allow us to learn about far away places. when you can't look up and learn about places, you are not about them. You're lucky if you know when in the world they are. Computers allow you to look up those places. You can look into going there for vacation or doing a report. @PERCENT2 of the adults who surveyed at the public library said the computers help. They are full of so much more information than books. To sum it up, computers allow you to learn about far away places. The third reason is computers allow you to talk online to people. This extends your friend ships with people. You can talk on the computer, not just at school. It also allows you meet new and different people. You can talk to people in @LOCATION1 that you couldn't talk to without computers. Computers allow you to open up the to all people. @PERCENT1 of parents who took a poll in @ORGANIZATION1 say they want their children to learn about different cultures. They need the computer for that task. To sum it up, computers allow you to talk online to people. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons are to teach hand eye coordination, learn about faraway places, and talk to people online. I strongly urge you to look at any point of view closely. This decision is now up to you.

1362	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1't you agree that computers should be limited or often not used? Recently, it has been brought to my attention that computers have a negative effect on society. Without a doubt, I firmly believe that computers should be a hobby not an addiction. People spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising and interacting with family and friends. Most teenagers are involved with cyber-bullying which takes place on computers. People spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising. I can remember when my step mom @PERSON1 was a size six in the waist. @PERSON1 would exercise everyday after work for two hours. This all changed when my dad bought her a lime green, @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 laptop for her birthday. @PERSON1 quickly became addicted to @CAPS3 (computer game) and began to cut down on her exercising routines. Six months later, when she went to a doctor's appointment she found out that she gained more than ten pounds. @PERSON1 is now a size fourteen in waist. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people gain weight because they cut down on exercising so they can have more computer time. Most people spend to much time on their computers and less time interacting with family and friends. This reminds me of my step dad @PERSON4. When @PERSON4 gets home from work he usually goes straight to the computer instead of having a conversation with the rest of the family. He gets angry when @PERSON2 (@NUM1 years old) bothers him because he wants to play. @PERSON4 is usually online. From three o'clock till ten o'clock playing chess with strangers from all over. What he doesn't know is that while he is building relationships with strangers he is breaking the bond between him and his loved ones. @PERCENT2 of teenagers are involved with cyber bullying. This reminds me of my cousin @PERSON3. Last @DATE1, @PERSON3 became a member of @CAPS4 @CAPS2, iTrouble quickly began to find her. In other words, girls from ages thirteen to twenty began to send her threatening messangers. No later than a day when @PERSON3 was walking down the street a gang of girls jumped her. However, she survived the brutal attack and deleted her @CAPS4 account. In conclusion, without a doubt, I firmly believe that people shouldn't spend to much time on computers. My three arguments are cyber-bullying, less exercise and less interaction with family and friends, @CAPS7 take my suggestion seriously and bann computers."	5	4		9																					
1366	1	"Dear Local newspaper, I think that computers have a bad effect on people because they will have no time to exercise, less time with friends and family, and it could give a younger child a bad influence. Here are my detailed reasons. The most important reason why computers have a bad effect on people is that the time they spend on the computer they could be exercising to stay healthy. For example my mom runs @NUM1 miles everyday and still has time to go on the computer. If you use the computer @NUM2 its bad, but if you use it in moderation then its a little better. For instance my mom lets me go me go on the computer, but she @CAPS1 makes me go outside and run around @CAPS1 people are always talking about obesity, and computers are one way its happening to kids and adults. They just sit their on the computer and do nothing while on the other hand they could be outside. Here is my second reason. The next most important thing is that kids and adults won't have time to spend time with their families and share memories with them. My mom always tells me the best part of your childhood is making memories with the people you love. My friends and I love to be outside and go to playgrounds and act like little kids, but it makes us laugh and people say that laughing keeps you happy and healthy. Here is my last reason. The last most important reason is it can give a younger chilld the wrong ideas. For example I have @NUM1 younger sisters and they love to go on the computer and some websites are not good for younger kids. One website could be @CAPS2 because bad peole post videos and the little children could see then and get the wrong idea. Here is my conclusion. In conclusion I think computers have a bad effect on people because they spend less time staying healthy, less time and with friends and family and it gives kids the wrong idea. I hope I got my point across that they are bad."	4	4		8																					
1375	1	"New @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 computers is a benefit to society. Most people not think so but there are many reasons why they are. People will always have something to do when they are bored, there is plenty to learn, and it keeps you organized. After reading this paper, you will agree with me that computers are a benefit. Do you ever get bored and have nothing to do ? Well if you have a computer around, there are endless things to keep you busy. People can talk to their friends and keep in teach with them. No matter how far away they go. There are many websites that have games you can play. Any type of game they are all on the computer. You @MONTH1 be thinking, "" I might get addicted to a game and never want to take my eys off the screen. Well, in that case, you can always set a timer on it to give you a certain amount of time, but don't worry, it warns you before it shuts down on you. The computer isnt' all fun and games though. It is filled with knowledge, it's like the brain of @NUM1 scientists and mathematicans put together. If you have a school assignment in write a paper on someone famous, you can research them on the computer for a quick way to get information. There will be plety of websites about that person. Also, everyday there are news updates about what is going on in the world. You never have to worry about not knowing whats going on. Do you like to stay organizes I personally, think it's easier to get through life and everyday, knowing where things are and staying organized. The computer is a great, easy way to keep organized. There are many programs that you can use to write documents, make graphs and whatever you need to do. About <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of working people need the computer to do their job and keep track of everything. @PERCENT1 of the working humans is a larger amount. So, thing about it, if computers weren't made, that <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of people would not have, jobs, or they would have to keep everything down on paper which @MONTH1 be a catastrophe. After a while, you @MONTH1 want to back everything up by copying all of your photos, files, music ect. to a @CAPS4 so you dont loose everything if your computer shuts down. After reading this, don't you agree with me, that computers are a benefit to society? There are many more reasons but this paper had alot. I hope you have realized that without computers, the world wouldn't be as it is today. Thank you for your time. "	5	5		10																					
1378	1	"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer? Of course you @CAPS1, that's where you get all the information you need. Computers are good and everyone should have one. The computers let you learn new things and you can search anything you want to know. It also lets you communicate with your family, friends, or other people you need to communicate with. It can also let you see disasters in other countries and teach you about the world. Computers are good and benefit a lot of people in these ways. Computers can allow you to learn new things and search up anything you want to know. If you're in school and you need to @CAPS1 research, well there you go, you have a computer to help you. This is also good for jobs. Any one can use them and learn new things at the same time. It let's you @CAPS1 work, learn new things, and it's fast and easy to @CAPS1. You don't have to @CAPS1 all that hard work of looking for a book and spending so much time looking for the information you need. Computers are great and you should use it. Another great thing about them is that you can communicate with them. If you have family or friends that live far away or in another country, then you can communicate them by computers. You can easily webcam with them or e-mail. This is very easy and this way you can stay close to them. This is also good if you @CAPS1 business online. You can @CAPS1 your job and talk to the people you need to talk to. If you ever have to arrange on emergency meeting and don't have time to call the people you need to, then simply send them an e-mail and your set for the meeting the next day and so are they. This is a perfect way for communication and business. My final reason for computers is that they are perfect to learn about disasters in other countries. If you ever miss the news and you really wanted to see them, then you can go on your computer and see the news and learn new things and see what bad things have happened. Also if you live some where that isn't your home town, then you can go online and see what is going on at your hometown and visit for any special occassions. You can learn a lot of new things about other countries. Also you can learn about new places if you ever want to move to another country. You can see hotels or anything you want to if you want to go on vacation. This is a perfect way for transportation and learn new things about other places. In conclusion to all of my facts, computers are good. It lets you learn new things and @CAPS1 research. Also, it lets you communicate with family, of friends in case of emergencies. Computers are also great if you want to go on vacation or learn new things about other countries. If you have a computer, then that is great. If you don't then you better go out and get one because these computers are awesome and can @CAPS1 just about anything you need. Stop waiting and get online or go out and buy one."	5	4		9																					
1384	1	"Dear @CAPS1, In my own opinion, computers do not have a positive effect on people. Online, you can go on any website and talk to people. Most of the time, you @MONTH1 not even know who it is your speaking with. Plus not all information you @MONTH1 find is true. Computers also take time away from doing something productive, like playing outside. In the next few pragraphs, I'll show you my point. First off, online websites have many different ways to contact people (chat rooms, blogs, email etc.) @CAPS2, do you really know if the people you're talking to are who they say they are? Back then, it was rare someone got caught when trying to kidnap a child by pretending to be someone online; @CAPS3 a days more and more people are getting caught. You @MONTH1 think this won't happen to your child, but my friend was being stalked online by someone what they haven't caught. We never thought something like that would happen, @CAPS2 it did. Also, once it's online it never goes away. So watch what you put online, there is always some way to find what you had posted even once deleted. Plus not every bit of information found online is ture. I professionals say that @PERCENT1 of kids have researched a project online then used a print source and found that information to be false. On websites like wikipedia any one has the ability to change what is written on the page. Most websites @PERCENT2 give the ability for anyone to do so. Also post and pictures on the internet @MONTH1 not always be appropriate. There's certain criteria we keep children from seeing for a reson. Lastly, computers keep you from doing anything productive. It @MONTH1 teach hand-eye coordination however it does not keep you fit and healthy. Already, @PERCENT3 of @CAPS4 alone are over weight and that's alot of people. Dr. @DR1 says that online games keep kids from getting much needed exsersize and fresh air, that every growing child needs. In conclusion the internet keeps children from going outside to play. Also, not everything found is what is true or right. Lastly, not everyone you find is the person they portray themselves. This is why I think that comperters aren't positive in society."	5	5		10																					
1390	1	"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a negative impact on society. I say this because it alows kids to be bullied at all hours of the day, it takes away from their exercise, and it gives then less time to study and do school work. Overall, i think that talking is the main use for computer. But, some times it is used in the wrong way, @CAPS1. Experts say that @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 kids have thing to use to talk on line, but the also say that @NUM3 in @NUM4 of thoes kids are bullyed on line. Also every year you hear someone or them, well most of the time it is because of @CAPS1. In fact I heard on the news that half of their kids were bullyed online. And because you can go on at all hours of the day, kids can get bullied at any time. Some child say that kids are happy when they go ho,e because they cant be buuyed but @CAPS3 be bullyed at their safe place, their home. Another bad thing about the computer is that it replace exercise. A text A and @CAPS2 football scout said ""every year their are less less people who play sports because of video game or computers."" @CAPS3 the obesity rate of kids has gone up in america and many agree that the cause computers taking place of exercise. Also people think that you get better hand eye coordination but most leaders agree that you don't because it is not your hand that is moving it is your mouse. Lastly, noe grades are lower then ever for students. Most teachers say that @NUM3 in @NUM6 students get good grades and they say that all @NUM7 that don't spend to much time all the computer. I was waching discovery chanel and it said that @CAPS3 most kids are spending @NUM4 hours on the computer and less than @NUM3 hour on studying or homework. The computer made for storing information and learning. How did we let it go from that to a tool wed for @CAPS1, making lazy kids, and for anti-learning!"	4	4		8																					
1391	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of the newspaper, I understand you think computers don’t have an effect on people. Computers do have an effect on people. For one reason the computer helps people find out information about anything. Also, it helps people do work. Plus, you can comunicate with anyone you want. Dont make any decitions before thinking about these effects on people. First of all, computers helps people find information quicly. To find information everybody uses either google or ask and many more. The information that people find would probably help them find were a store is or a number for a restaurant. Not just that but, you can find at how much something is at a store and if it is on sale or not. These are just some of the great effects computers have on people. However, work is a really large effect computers have on people. For example, computers would really help someone if they are looking for a job because their are many stores you get to choose from. To go along with that, adults and children use the computer to type something on word if its for a report for work or an essay in school. Maybe you have used the computer to type information for your newspaper. Yet, one thing kids love to do on the computer is comunicate with their friends. Most kids either use facebook, @CAPS2, or oovoo to comunicate. Having these programs helps kids stay in touch with friends that moved away. Plus, one thing good about these programs are if you have family that live very far away from you, you can always talk to them at any time. I understand why you think computer dont have an effect on people. Computers do have many effects on people. Thats not all, computers help people find what their looking for. It also helps you with your work. Never the less computers are a great way to comunicate with friends or family. Think long and hard about what decition that you want to make."	4	4		8																					
1392	1	"I think that computers have a good effect on people. When people are on the computer they are not on for very long. I also think computers have a good effect on people because of the new technology. Computers are positive and they can help you when you are stuck or need to look something up. To me computers are positive. When people go on the computer ther are not on for @NUM1 hours straight. Sure they might be on @NUM1 hours in a day but they do other stuff in between like school, meals and activities. Some people need computers for their @CAPS1. News @CAPS2 companies need computers for editing and printing out the papaer. They also put the news on there website. What would most people do without a computer? Computers are positive because of the new technology! The new technology is helping people interact over the. if you have a long distance friend or family member, there are how many ways to talk to them. You could use @CAPS3, skype, oovoo, @CAPS4 or even email. When I go on the computer I dont just sit and watch @CAPS5 @CAPS6 or @CAPS7 online. I interact with my friends @PERCENT1 of us population between the ages @NUM3 have a @CAPS3. @PERCENT2 have skype or oovoo and talk to people that are too far away to visit.

If there is a word you want to know and isn't i the dictionary look it up and it will be online. Computers have a positive effect on people. Nobody spends so much time on the computer that they can't go outside or hang out with there friends. People actually need the computer for their @CAPS1 the new technology that is coming out is letting people interact with people across the world.

I go on the computer to to my friends and check email and stuff and then i go outside to play. You should only be on the computer for @NUM1 minutes a day then go get some exercise. If you stay on the computer all day you will smell, get fat, get lazy, and no one wents these things. These are the things you should have. You can play basketball, go on a bike ride, with some friends, go swimming, I do this type of stuff every day and I am in good shape because of it. I stay healthy and fit I dont sit on the computer all day on a sunny day. You become more if you go more it gives you a chance to hang out with some neighborhood kids.

Computers deal with all sorts of things, from hand-eye cordination, learning about faraway places and people, to talking online with anyone. Come on in to the wonderful world of computers. Computers have a super positive effect on people. They help teach hand eye cordination. You can look at the screen without having to look down at your hand to move the mouse.

Everyone thinks computers are so wonderful and can only positively affect you. But do they really consider both sides? Most likely not.. That is why I am here. Computers discourage exercise cut down the number @ORGANIZATION1 hours spent bonding with your family and are a waste @ORGANIZATION1 money and space. I believe computers should be re-examined and peole should stop depending on them so much. Which country has more than @NUM1 million fast food, restaurants currently functioning?

1424	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I belive that computers benefits the people of today. The invention of the computer had helped people to send messages and information to each other, helped students with school and allows children to have something to do when they can't go outside. Let me explain. The computer had created easier way for people to send messages and information to one and other. Before the invention of the computer, the only way to pass on information was by mail or phone. The computer sped up this process. In fact, people had recived information about @PERCENT1 faster with the invention of the computer. I was once able to send my friend an email about getting the homework faster than writing him a letter. Clearly, computers made it easier for people to comunicate with each other. Also, computers help students with school. Before the computer, a student had to use a type writer to type their papers. Using a typewriter, when they made mistakes which was on, they had to start all over. It;s a completely different story now. In fact, a study done by the board of ed. shows students write papers so faster and better with a computer rather than a typewriter. I remeber my grandfather told me about how he typed papers. It took him about an hour he typed papers. It took him about an hour and a half to write a paper on a typewriter, while the longest it took him was a half an hour on a computer. As you can see computers have helped students all across the . Lastly, computers supply kids with things to do while they can't go out side to enjoy nature. Many people would that kids would go on their computer when they were able to go outside. A study done by the @CAPS2-obesity shows that @PERCENT2 of kids would rather be outside playing and excersising than in their house on their computer. But sometimes, during certain weather conditions, kids aren't able to go outside, so they myt entertain themselves indeers. A study done by @ORGANIZATION1 shows that mere the @PERCENT3 of kids go on their computer when they can't be outside. If suddenly those kids lost their computer privleges, many of them will have little to entertain themselves with. Clearly, the computer occupies the time of kids who can't go outside. In conclusion, the computer has enormouse benifits on society. It allows people to send messages and information faster, helps students whith school, and gives kids something to do when they can't be outside.

1427	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students in @NUM3 grade go on the computer each night to complete homework and to connect with friends and family? I think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one. A computer can be used for communication, education, and for accessing important information quickly, such as the local news. Now, let me tell you why computers are good for communication. When I was in elementary school, I had a friend who I was very close to and a part of his life. Unfortunately, he had to move away. But I still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while. A convenient way to do this was by using a computer. The computer allows you to easily contact an old friend so that you can @CAPS5 stay in touch. Different types of communication on the computer can be e-mail, instant-messaging, video chat, online chat groups...etc. This helps people stay connected. That's why I think communication is the biggest effect on people due to the use of a computer. But, a computer can also be used for learning. At school or work, both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects, vacation spots, learning about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes things as complicated as scientific chemicals. For example when my class researched different things about the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, our main source of infromation was the internet on our computers. We researched the customs, the foods, the way of dressing, the traditional holidays, and their way of entertainment. Also, kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it. This is teaching them hand-eye coordiantion, and how to type. The computer is not @CAPS5 used for just communication. It's a good way to educate everyone although the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information. ""@CAPS6 and adults often check their e-mail and homepage everyday for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy, ""says expert @PERSON1. I think that the internet gives citizens a fast and easy way to access information about what's going on in our town, state, country, and world. For example, it can tell us about the series of shootings goiong on throughout @LOCATION1 or the many house robberies in our town. Us, @CAPS7 citizens, wnt to know everything... for us to stay safe and notified on the latest. Another example is that I logged on the computer three dats ago and it notified me about the earthquake in @LOCATION2. But there are so many benefits of a computer. The effects computers have on people are beneficial. It allows people to stay in touch, learn about places and people, and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news. I think you should take my ideas into consideration and publish them for everyone."	6	5		11																					
1428	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think computers do benefit society because computers can do alot of things like teach you. Computers are very helpful now, mostly every thing gets done on it. The computer teaches good eye cordination, how to focus, and show you stuff you don't know about. Without an computer you really can't get any thing done or reddy. A computer can be helpful for lots of things like job aplications of taxe's, or at a grocry store register, typeing and being on the computer is exercising but not for your body. When your on a computer exercise your hand's and your brains. With out computers you really cant do any thing. Mostly everything you do in life have to deal with some type of computer. I think that the people that said they shouldnt be on the computer is wrong because they can interact with there family that's far away thats also on the. You can enjoy nature by just takeing a look old you don't have to walkt out. Thats why I think computers are positive and helpful."	3	3		6																					
1449	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers! Computers have a great effect on people. The advances in technology with computers benefits the society. Computers give people a place to chat with others, learn on school websites, and it teaches people hand-eye coordination. Computers are changing the world throughout everywhere. Computers give people a place to interact with others. There are thousands of websites that have chat places and are online chat rooms. That gives you a place to talk to others and even see what might be going on throughout the world. Also, chat rooms on the computer can help friends always keep in touch. Studies show that ninety percent of @CAPS1 that have a chat room to go to with friends often have more friends than none. Obviously, the interactions with others on the computer have a great effect on people. School websites also give people benefits in our society. It gives us the ability to learn more about what we are learning in school and maybe the ability to learn new things too. When almost every school in the @LOCATION1 has a school website, that helps students who are having trouble in school I know that from my experiences that having a computer helps me in school whenever I forgot what my homework was or I need to study in a quiz or test, I can always go on my computer and find what I need for school. When the computer know that it benefits our society. Computers teach hand-eye coordination too. When you use the computer for games or anything you do it teaches you how to move the mouse quickly and keep your eyes to used on the screen. Whenever I have the ability to use the computer, I always do. That's because with all the and websites it will teach us hand-eye coordination with I'm just having fun. Ninety-five percent of people who use the computer enjoy to use it. That's ninety-five percent of people who are learning more hand-eye coordination. If that doesn't benefit the society, than nothing does. As I have shown, computers deffinitly do benefit society. I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. That is because it gives people a place to interact with others, to learn things on school websites, and they teach hand-eye coordination. In conclusion, computers have a strong effect on people today."	4	5		9																					
1450	1	"Click click, another information page opens up on your handy @LOCATION4 these trusty, smart, and easy to use divices are always a object to have. Although, people are now starting that these handy desktops are bad for your well-being oposing that people strongly think that we dont get enough exercise or outdoor activitys in. Well computers are such a great entertainment system also, have a vast information supplie, and even allow socialization with friends/ family. I don't understand why they say this. So let me express my love for computers to you. Televisions, radios, and @NUM1 payers are no match for the internet and it's great wide spread entertainment system. The computer has all of the faimly fun movies, itunes tracks, and even websites where you could make your own movies. Posting pictures on the @CAPS1 and sending them via email only by a click of your mouse. The internet is the obvious best reason for a faimly movie night. One of the greatest pro about the internet is the vividsorce of information. Google, wikipedia, or even dictionary.com are the greatest information sites of the @DATE1. As much as nature watching and exercise is healthy and fun I would rather learn about a sunny beach of @CAPS2 or the great landscape of @LOCATION1. If your looking up how to tie a tie or even info about your history report the @CAPS3 is a sure easy thing. How could you talk to your friend who is across the world in @LOCATION2 or germany. The answer is simple, skype, fiacebook, myspace and more are all available on your handy @CAPS3. Many sites have a no fee polocy so they cant charge them money for social living with friends. As a personal experience I could now talk to my cousins wqho live in @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION1 due to the great interaction site of facebook. And why would you take the time to run across town to be unsure that thier even there. Obviously internet is a great socializing activity. Now that I have stated my opinion about the wonderful effect of the internet such as the entertainment system, information about the history of the world, and even the socializing with friends. I'm people will open thier eyes see the great uses of the computer."	5	5		10																					
1452	1	"Dear @PERSON4, I strongly believe that use of computer is beneficial to the community. One reason I feel this way is that computers can improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. These computers provide access to games helpful in @ORGANIZATION2 training. In fact, @ORGANIZATION2, in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, just began using these games as part of their training this @DATE1. Instructors report that @ORGANIZATION2 skills in trainees and students are far better than in years past. Additionally, computer games can improve reflexes. Two years ago, a man named @PERSON3, @NUM1 years old, fell onto the train tracks just as a train was coming by. Through extra-ordinary reflexes he managed to leap out of the way, saving his life. When asked how he did @CAPS5, he said he had been playing computer games since he was @NUM2 years old. These games also make you more intelligent. The @ORGANIZATION1's @DATE2 study reports that brains were @PERCENT1 more active after use of computers. The researchers achieved this data by attaching electrolytes to the patient's brain both before and after using the computer. @CAPS5 is for these reasons that computers improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. Another reason for why computers are beneficial is that they allow you to talk online. They even allow you to communicate with your family who live far away, strengthening your relationships. I recently got back in touch with my cousin who moved to @LOCATION3. Letters were too expensive and took too long, but email and skype provide us with a great alternative. These computers also improve social skills. @PERSON1, resident here in town, says, ""I love using computers because I can talk to my friends whenever I want, and I feel like @CAPS5 really helps us communicate."" Who wouldn't love a machine that provides a service like that? These computers can even improve your mood. In a test done by @ORGANIZATION3 in @DATE3, @NUM3 people were put in seperate rooms with personal computers for @NUM4 hour. Afterwards, @PERCENT2 said they felt an improvement in their mood. Computers are great because they allow you to talk online. Finally, computers allow you to learn about other places. Virtual tours are becoming more and more common today. Infact, at @CAPS2.org, you can take virtual tours of over @NUM5 different countries, including @LOCATION5, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION6. You can also learn about other cultures and their traditions through online videos at youtube.com and articles at wikipedia.org, the free encyclopedia. You can even learn new recipes. Celebrity chef extraordinare @PERSON2 not only posts all her recipes online at mstewart.com, but she even finds some of them! In a recent interview by @CAPS3 magazine, when asked where she's found some of her best recipes, including her famous @CAPS4 chocolate cake, @PERSON2 admits she found most of them online, saying, ""@CAPS5's a powerful resource that more people should use. Al @CAPS6 currently owns the world's best cookbook!"" @CAPS5 is because of this that computers allow you to learn about other place. Thank you for your time, and I hope you take what I have said into consideration. @CAPS5 is for all of these reasons I strongly believe computers are beneficial to the community."	6	6		12																					
1454	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1's small world after all - and growing smaller as computer usage becomes more and more widespread. Thousands upon thousands of sites and applications are now at your fingertips. I firmly believe that the effects of computers are overwhelming positive. For one thing, they increase hand-eye coordination.For another, they are a great means of communication.Finally they are a very powerful research tool. Some @MONTH1 say that computers are lessening time with family and friends, but I don't agree. Computers help us stay more conected than ever! The computer is not evil - quite the opposite! First of all, computers are great for increasing hand-eye coordination. In recent study by @PERSON1, he noticed a significant increase in motor skills of children aged @NUM1 to @NUM2 when they used educational computer programs such as @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for just half an hour, once a day. Children who did not use the program were seen to develop motor skills at a much lower rate. Hand-eye coordination is a skill needed from birth to death, and should be encouraged as uch as possible. I know that @CAPS1 greatly helps me in my daily life - and probably you in yours as well - from the mos basic tasks of eating and brushing my teeth to typing, drawing, and playing piano. As you can see, hand-eye coordination is very important. Second in my reasoning is that computers are brilliant communication aids. People can't always be reached by phone. An email could be waiting for them online whenever - and whereever - they check @CAPS1. Also, documents can be sent over email that would be near impossible for a home phone and difficult for most cells to process. Revolutionary video-conferencing programs like @ORGANIZATION2 can even allow us to talk to people around the world, practically eye to eye. I use @CAPS1 to keep in touch with family on the @LOCATION2. How about you? Last - but (at the risk of sounding cliched) definitely not the least - computers are very powerful research tools. Everything from the schedule of the local zoo (thus preventing toddler meltdowns when one arrives only to find @CAPS1 closed) to the average life span of the @CAPS4 elephant (@NUM3 years). Rather than skimming book after books for a single piece of information, plug your query into any of many search engines, from @ORGANIZATION1 to @CAPS5., and find answers instantly. Find about @LOCATION3 without the expense of a plane ticket. See photos of @LOCATION1 - a sight most people would never get to see without the internet. The computer can take us anywhere. In conclusion, computers are a great resource that are often wrongly portrayed in a bad light. Computers teach and improve valuable hand-eye coordination. Also, they help greatly with communication. And finally, they are a powerful research device. Computers are oftern shown as the bane of society. This is simply untrue. They are an excellent tool for all ages. Technology is not our enemy. Don't treat @CAPS1 like one."	5	6		11																					
1458	1	"Due to an on going debattle about weither or not computers benefit society I am writing to you to inform you of my opinion on this mater. I believe that computers have more of a benefit than they do a draw back. I believe this because. First of all, computer bring about online communication. Also computers advance and enhance learning, had to mention that computers advance emloyment. As I mentioned, computers bring about online communications. Now after reading this there must be one side running thru your head define this well online communication, include social networkinjg sites litre facebook and twitter and not to forget my space. This also includes email and blogs and some chat sites. Okay enough of that But how do these things inventions iprove our lives. These inventions allow long distance communication bringing people ""closer together."" @CAPS1 example, my uncle lives in @LOCATION1. And thru facebook, my mother can speak with him any time she wishes and over from their relatives. So online communication @MONTH1 be very nessary @CAPS1 same. Also you could use email to communicate with others although it travels slower than other of electronic communication. Besides, I mentioned learinig. Computers can improve learning in a variety of ways. Computers improve learning because they speed the flow of information to the students can go to such places and a school websites to findout more on a particular occuring at the school. @CAPS1 example, I go on my school's website to retreve nightly homewrok assignments and read the next day's daily annocments. Teachers might post helpfel hints on homework and @MONTH1 a detailed explanation of the assignment. Also computers can improve learning by assiting with research projects @CAPS1 example a couple of weeks ago my health class was information car our illegal drug project. So with the information, made of wide variety of brouchers from it."	4	5		9																					
1459	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Some people @MONTH1 thingk that computers are helping our society, but I disagree. People who are sitting on the computer are not getting exercise or seeing beautiful nature. Do you want to get fat sitting next to a metal box? People are also not visiting friends and family and those are the most important. People in your life. Do you want to be the one sitting on a coputer all day getting fat or do you wan't to be physically fit while getting exercise. The only workout your getting on the computer is your fingers. So you should be getiting off your lazy bum, bum and getting some good old exercise. Yes computers teach you things, but exercise teaches you you things while you are getting fit. Who wouldn't want to see the beauty of nature. Yes you can see pictures of nature on the computer, but those are just a bunch of pixels mushed together. In the real world it is all natural and sometimes more beautiful than on the computer. How doesn't that sound better than the computer. All of the cool, fit people are outside enjoying nature, so be one of the cool people and go outside and have yourself a ban looking at exotic plants and beautiful animals. You can do both of those with your friends and family while sitting on your computer you don't see them as much @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 love their family and friends and I bet you are one of them. Friends and family can also help you get through hard times without them whi knows wgere you would be in life. So do yourself a favor get off the computer, and go visit some really great people. Its now or neve to get off that computer or your family and friends are going to leave you and you are going to get fat on top of that. Do you want to be that person? You are also going to miss out on the beauty of nature. So go, go, go, have yourself some fun."	4	4		8																					
1461	1	"I would agree because computers do help people with other things like vacations sights, jobs, presents and shoping. So many uses for the computer. But creators of the computer are worried that people are spending to much time on the computer. Mainly its about conserners and users, most of those people complain that their having no time with their family and friends. You never know if the users are looking up vacation trips for both friends and familys. The things that conserners dont get is that the computer can teach you alot of things, history, mathmatics, science experiments and many more. Computers are also used in schools to help students with their work, even teachers use the computer for grades. It is true about people not going outside geting some fresh air or even taking a walk in the park. They cant keep themselfs on the computer for like @NUM1 hours, its just crazy. So i would go with both sides. Its just better to enjoy life then just look up things that you dont really need to. You should only need to go on like paying bills, and furneture for your house. Thats why the computer was invented."	3	3		6																					
1462	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 a world where the uneployment rate rises sinificgently, people can't communicate or learn as fast, and everyone is stressed out. That's what the world would be like if computers just discapeared. I think computers are more benefical to society then some people relize. They teach us new things and help us with hand-eye coordination. Many jobs are involved with computers, such as an acountend. Computer games and @CAPS2 help take the edge off after a hard day. Schools are the backbone of society. They teach kids and teen how to become sucessful adults. Computers have helped greatly in speeding up the teaching process. Teachers can now acess grades in a heartbeat. My computer helps me."	4	3		7																					
1463	1	"Dear Newspaper: I have just read your recsent article on a weather computers are helping, or recking society.

If you do this the wrong way it could blow out of the bold and potentially you. There are many other uses is you just can't find your family is counting on you. You can do two things, you can panic and let everyone down, you can go or the internet and save. But all I have wasn't to the real. The computer does effect how people exercise I know what you are. but you have. Clear enough. The internet does effect how you exercise. It's pros how to better and more affective ways to healthy. There is also cons; some of the con sinclude hot. All of these can lead to different things like going or. it isn't, its only a bad thing when your.

With computers you can contact people in different parts of the @CAPS1. You can search up different information over the internet. Computers also benifit other electronic inventions. What do @LOCATION5, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION6 and @LOCATION7 all have in common? you can contact the people there with computers! while talking to people around the @CAPS1, you can learn something about a culture or lifestyle that you didn't know before.

1472	1	"Dear @CAPS1, The computers that are being used, do have a positive effect on people. For example, there's better communication with friends and family, you get instant news on any topic, and you get advanced education. Imagine if no important business was trying to be in contact with you by cell phone, but you missed the call. No worries the person no contact you by a simple email. Computers are also a positive effect because if you have a facebook, or other interacting werbsites, you know what's going on in your friends life all the time without having the to by reaching them all the to see how they are doing. Every adult watching the news at night before they go to bed to see what has @CAPS2, what if you went to bed early. How would you know what happened? That's when you would go online and check what you missed, you could've missed out on what happened in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3, or missed out on the wars to the @LOCATION1, or even tragedies that happened right near you.

1476	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I am awair that more people use computers everyday. I think that computers does have a positive effect on adults and their children. Computes help us by giving information about things in othe contries, states, and towns. It also can help children with school homework. Last thing is that it helps you communicate with friends and family members that live to far of a distance where you cant see them. Computers gives information about the latest and most recient things that happen in other towns contries, and states. If you needed to find out something that happened about @NUM1 years ago or more you wouldn'@CAPS1 see it on @CAPS1.V., you would be able to find it on the internet. Without the internet you wouldn'@CAPS1 find the things you was looking for. Another thing that computers is very useful for is helping kids with homework and school work. If your work is typed then your work is neater and more understandable. I can understand why some parents wouldnt want their kids on the computer doing homework. They might start doing something else or get answers for something they can do without the computer. But using the computer with homework and school work will make it where you can make sure your work is correct. Last, computers can help you correct with friends and family members. If you have friends and family that you want to reconnect with the computer can help you find information about where they are located. That @MONTH1 not be good for people who are trying to stalk or abuse someone. But in other cases like be unite with family can be very helpful. This can make families keep in touch and friend close. What are some of your feelings about computers. Some people @MONTH1 dislike them but they have good reasons why.

If you were working on a homework assingment and you needed some help you can just go on the computor. It is also very benifial because student can have lots of fun playing games on the comput say like it's a cold rainy day and there is nothing to do, a kid can get some entertainment by going on the computer.

Doctors show that @PERCENT2 of people that spend time more than @NUM1 hours a day on a computer have glasses or have a very poor vision. All those people didn't want poor vision but beacuse of the computer they got that wich really stinks. Now as you can you see computers really can change your life. So that's your discision. Pick wrong from right, all up to YOU. Now make it."	4	4		8																					
1494	1	"Dear editor, Computers are one of the best things that have ever happened to the human race. They benefit society in every way imaginable, and have numerous positive affects on people. Computers improve hand eye coordination, allow people to learn about many subjects that books do not give them acess to, and allow millions of people every day to talk and communicate with friends and family. The most important use for computers is learning. Using computers, billions of people gain knowledge that they never would have been able to learn before. Many people like myself check the weather on the computer daily, making sure we are prepared or dressed appropriatly for the weather. Without computers, I would not be able to do this. Also, on days when it snows during the night, I always check the school's website when I wake up in order to ensure that school is still on. This is a helpful resource and I don't know what I'd do without it. Another thing computers allow us to do is check the news. With the click of your mouse, you can check to see who won the presidency, or what shows are on tonight. Another amazing aspect of computers is that they improve eye-hand coordination greatly. This not only benifits my mom who checks her email five times every minute, but my little three year old sister who loves to move the mouse around, and type in random letters on documents. It could entertain her for days, but most importantly, it helps improve her eye-hand coordination every second she sits in that chair. This improved skill will help her enourmously in her future when she soon begins to play sports, and ride bikes. Finally, computers allow millions of friends and family to communicate daily at no cost. If classmates forgot to write down homework they can email the teacher instantly, and know exactly what the homework is and even open the sheet that the teacher attached, and print it out. A couple of weeks ago, my dad went to @LOCATION1 for thirteen days, and it was outragously expensive to talk to him on his phone. So, every couple days, he video chatted with me instead so I could talk to him. hear what he was doing, and even see the view of @LOCATION2 from his window. This was very special to me and could not have been done without computers. As it is so plainly clear, computers help us in so many ways that we forget about like educating us, improving our eye hand coordination, and allowing us to communicate with friends and family. These are just a couple of the positive affects and benifits that computers provide us with."	5	5		10																					
1496	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 that humanity has, has it's up and down's and it's positives and negatives. the something with technology. It has it's ups's and downs but because of it our society grows increasingly advanced. It gives us the oppertunity to grow more sophisticated to set our goals beyond reach. We make the start of great things with these. Computers teach us and sometimes can guide you. You can click on a link and give you an amazing oppertunity or click on the wrong one and give you d virus. Computers can get you away from all the stress in your life and take you to a beautiful place it can give you the chance to let you learn something that you didn't even know existed."	3	3		6																					
1498	1	"Dear Newspaper editor I would like to make @CAPS3 about the benifits of owning a computer. For example you can learn many thing you would of never of been able too, you can also go in chat rooms and talk with friends or other people and it can even make teaching esyer too. Computers in many countres are standard and we use then to learn many things but if you bring one to the tribes in @LOCATION1 it will look like a alein object but once they know how to use it it can open there eyes for ever many people in remote ribes and areas dont even know theres been a man on the meon. Another great thing about the computer is you can pay bills such as taxes, insurance, credit cards and othe payments which is good so if you cant get of your house or the place is closed you wont get late fees and it can even help you save large amounts of money too. Many people use the computer to socialize by joining online website such as @CAPS1, twitter and myspace were you can talk veiw pictures and see what friends are up to. Also on @CAPS2 you can message friends too. Further more many people play games on the computer some are single player and some are online and have millions of players on at a time. you can also hook other gaming system up to your computer to play with other people and even yet hints and cheats too. The biggest reasons that computers are benifit though is that they revolutionized school now for homework instead of doing a work sheet you go on the computer and do it and print it out or email it to your teacher. Another reason the computer is amazing is that it makes research for projects and home work much more easyer, redrable and it ean give you a much more broader view of the topic. By far the best thing ahead the computer is the fact that many teachers use them to teach with and show videos. Therefore it is much easier to learn and under stand thing wich will help us in the future be successful. Also many kids pay less attention when a teaches is giving a lecture but when there is a computer playing a video it will grasp the students attention much better. These are all the reasons why I think the computer is a excellant invention and every family and school should own one I hope you will find my @CAPS3 very persuading and puplish it."	4	4		8																					
1504	1	"When people think about computers the first thing they think of is games. Thats not all they are good for. For most people they are very usefull. Computers are great for @ORGANIZATION1. At @ORGANIZATION1 they help with homework and projects. When we are assigned a project we need to do research on a topic and the fastest and easier way is by computer. The students at @ORGANIZATION2, especially @NUM1 graded, are able to type up easys because it's faster and alot easier. If we are at home and we forgot our homework we could look it up online. This can be really helpful and convient to students and teachers. Sometimes it's not @ORGANIZATION1 but its finding things. Technology and computers have came a long way. Now we can look up directions to places we dont or cant find. People can also finding names, numbers, or address useing websites like yellow pages can be a relieable resource for that. Say your going for vaction and your try to find somewhere to stay it could be tough but there are websites you can go on were if you want something fast or mabye a nice hotel for a low price you can find it. The computer can be very fan and intersting when you go places like the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and you want to show picture of the great time you had so you can post them online. Say you havent talked to and old friend in a while, you can look for them on @CAPS3 or another website and start talking agian you can also play games and connect with friends or play games with friends while online. Weather its @ORGANIZATION1, finding things, or connecting with frends the computer has what ever you need. Maybe it will at one point get damged but they have people who can fix it. Plus if you think about it computers have very reliable resourses that are more updated then books."	4	4		8																					
1506	1	"Computers can affect people in many ways. Most people use computers too much and it can affect their health and the peole around them. People need to get out side and get more active. America is becoming obese and not getting any real useful information out of the computer. Some people are just sitting, mind lessly infront of their computer and eating at the same time! That makes things worse as not only are they not getting exercise, but now they are gaining weight as well as not losing any. This is the exact opposite of what a human should be doing. True people exercise every day. Being on the computer is not a bad thing, sometimes. Sometimes you need to find something about nature but wouldn't it be easier to go outside and find new think I dont live by the but you can to one all the woods cannot be just gone. Even your front yard is full of nature, and you will be getting some (not all) exercise at the same time. Familys are constantly having problems about family members who never have time to talk and funch holes in walls for losing a video game. Dr. @PERSON1 or ""The studies of the human mind"" says ""I found out technology and online gaming increases anger in most people."" That goes to show it can cause problems in familys everywhere because of a video game! So please make sure you try to spend time with your family. So that shows that the computer can be fun, but also dangerous."	4	4		8																					
1508	1	"Computers. Theres fun. But there's also a down side. People spent more time on it than outside or exersizing or even getting together with friends and family. But on ther hand, they're also fun, help kids, and even help get together from dating sites. It makes them happy. It's fun! Computers are fun. They provide a wide arrow of games, educational can just plain fun. You can play role playing games (which and fun because I play a few myself), or you could play educational games like the games on islands, or other downlodabal education games that are, @CAPS1 not fun but essential for the growth and development of a learning child. They also can help kids learn how to and other things at a very early age. Some very adults have and various other things that I cannot the life of me think of @CAPS2 thing computer get them together and they are happy. They do this hundreds of a day. Take away computers and people will die alone and sad. so in conclusion my ideas where! fun help kids and help older people get together. Read this and @CAPS3 sure you'll see it my way."	4	4		8																					
1509	1	"Hi my name is @CAPS1 and I'm writing to the local news paper to say that computers are good for people and helps alot like how to get one place two another, how to learn about black history or famous people that did something to the world, and how to find out the news and weather from home or at work, how to keep your besnness going without computers their jobs would be hopless, and like of your family or you tyring to make it in life and the only way to get in contact would be the computers there are computers every where even doctors use them at a hospital to keep people alive to see what wrong with them and where they came from, and one more jobs need computers to, to see if the person is capable for the job so they might look for background information with out it even you would not have a good job so hee are some resons why computers are important. One of them is we need computers for so that we can get around, if your planing to ge some where for the @DATE1 you would look on the computer for that perfect place. Second if you don't know how to get there of corse you can use a @CAPS2 but the computer is the best because it shows the miles and how long would it take to get there so thats one of them. And second to help learn about black history month and famous people, we all know that black history month is in books but not lot of boosks have alot of info in them thats why the computer comes in handy because like on google it gives you more info and shows the image of that person so that you know who they aare, like a famous singer or raper you @MONTH1 like but knows nothing about them you would use the computer, @CAPS3 because thats the best thing to do. Third would be how to find out the news and weather, I if you did not watch the news because you missed it what could you do is go on a news site and watch the news that have been aired on tv, or a favirote show to if you want. Foruth would be besnness, with out computers there busnness would be hopless it would not last that long. @NUM1. They would not knwo there profits @NUM2. how would they monege anything, that would happen if they did not have any type of computers. There lots of more stuff that coulf have said that prove computers are good and why we need them but i just had to cut it short and schools need computers the most to take test on the computers of they have to, so thats all the resons why we need computer and why they are good bye."	4	4		8																					
1513	1	"Dear local newspaper, I am writing to tell you I think that computers are a good thing because they let people communicate, tons of people haves jobs because of computers and People have help with homework because of computers. People communicate by email and aim and facebook and everything else. People have jobs on computers like cortreporters and tax-retelers and sales people. Lastley kids do homework on the computer and look up stuff ""@CAPS1 related"" on the computer and the other stuff like that. lastley I think computers are good for people, they help with education, work and comunication with friends and family."	3	2		5																					
1514	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, In my opinion I support the advances in technology. Advances in technology helps us get information on things we need to get information on, we can chat with friends and family online and it can help our reading and hand-eye coordination skills. One of the reasons why I support advances in technology is because computers/phones can help us get information on things we need to get information on. We need to know what is going on around us, all the time. We need to know what is happening and what is happening with other people in our lives. We need to know the weather/traffic conditions if you have children you need to know if the school is open and if you work in places that use computers for information, you need to check if your boss or co-worker sent you anything important that you need to know about. The second reason why I support advances in technology is because we can chat with friends and family online. We can chat with our family and friends on the other side of the world who have computer. Most of us want to know if our family and friends are ok and healthy, even though we can't see them in person. I, for one, knows this is fact because my family and friends touch each other online. Staying communicated with our family and friends keeps our boats strong. The last reason why I support advances in technology is because computers can help us with our reading and hand-eye coordination skills. Computers can help our reading skills because if we don't have time to go to the bookstore to get a book, we can read the book online for free. It can help our hand-eye coordination because it can help our fingers move faster and help us do things faster. I stated all of my reasons why I support advances in technology. Computers can help us get information on things we need to get information on, we can chat with friends / family online and it can help our reading and hand-eye coordination skills."	4	4		8																					
1516	1	"Dear local news, @CAPS2 more and more people use computers people ask if computers actually benifit society. In my opinion I think computers do. They provide entertainment, acess to daily uses, and have many websites for social interactions. I think computers really do benefit society here in why. Computers provide entertainment to people. Many people will want to watch funny videos or thier favorite @CAPS1 show on the internet. of the most popular website for watching videos on you tube. Another great source of entertainment are video games. People buy video games at their or play them on websites like @CAPS2 you can see entertainment on the computer has a much more compared to the @CAPS1 were @CAPS2 program is shown at a certain time instead of when ever you want. Another benefit computers bring to society is acess to dailt uses, the internet provids that can tell you your local weather. Instead or local news imidiatly acess it on you @CAPS4 you can acess encyclopedia and distionarys like at the websites @CAPS5 provide an easy imidiats fools for daily uses. One least example towards the of computers Their are many websites that you can. One of @CAPS5 websites is called , @CAPS6 lets you upload picture of pople or family events for people in you @MONTH1 video chat with people over a and see the other persons face. You can't do that on a telephone or with texting or a cell phone. Many experts believe that computers are taking away time with family and friends but with websites like @CAPS6 it is actually adding time. In conclution, @CAPS5 reasons support my opinion that computers benefit society, They provide entertainment, easy acess to and have many websites for social interactions, @CAPS7 society would be alot harder and this is why I think computers benifit society. "	4	4		8																					
1520	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 have many debated on whether computers are good or bad. @CAPS6, I believe that computers aren't as good as many people think. Ever since computers were invented people haven't been exercising. Also less kids are reading. Lastly computers are taking away family time. When was the last time you saw a kid outside doing something active such as running or playing a sport? If you haven't it's probably because they are inside with their eyes glued to a computer screen. Exercise is a big part in staying healthy and fit. More kids are becoming over weight everyday. Computer are just another reason why. I had a friend who used to spend all her time on the computer. She became very lazy. She never wanted to exercise or doing anything active. Little by little she started gaining weight. This is happening all around the world and it need to @CAPS4! What's your reading level? @CAPS3 are students in @NUM1 grade with a @NUM2 grade reading level. Part of the reason is because they rather use their free time on the computer instead of picking up a book. Schools now do program called @CAPS5 @NUM3. This program is designed to help students improve their reading levels. I believe that if students would turn off the computers long enough and @CAPS5 we wouldn't need this program. My mom makes sure I @CAPS5 for at least @NUM4 mins everyday. Every student do the same. I remember a saying ""family time is golden time"" @CAPS6, now a days no one spends time with their family. Once again computers have played a part in this too. It's not just kids who have droped family time for computer time. It's adults too. I think the last time I spent some time with my family was about @NUM5 weeks ago when my grandparents came to visit. After that everyone went right back to staring at computer screens. In conclusion, the computers"	4	5		9																					
1522	1	"Dear editor of the @PERSON1, I heard you are writing a section in your newspaper about computers and I just thought I would voice my opinion. Personally, I think computers have a positive effect on people. First, I think computers are swell because you are able to learn things about faraway places, like countries on the other side of the world, from the comfort of your home. Also, the information on the internet can help with students' schoolworks. Finally, you are able to talk with other people on-line. These are just a few points why computers are very importent, that you should include in your article. First off, editor of the @PERSON1, I think computers are good for mankind becasue you are able to learn about places on the other side of the world, while sitting at home drinking hot cocoa. This is so very convinient. There are websites containing the geography, languages, and traditions of countries waiting for you to learn. For example, once my friend, @PERSON3, was planning on going to @LOCATION1 for a business trip, but had no idea how to speak the language. I recommended the website, www.Indianow.com and in two weeks she was speaking like an expert. Another time, my sister, @PERSON4, was visiting her in-laws for the first time. They were full @CAPS1 and she wanted to bake something traditional for them. She looked up a recipe on the web and everyone was satisfied with the scrumptious ravioli she made. This is just one reason the internet is so useful. Second, computers are an amazing invention because you can find help for schoolwork easily. My brother, @PERSON5, was having problems with learning about the seasons, but with one click, he was full of knowledge. Also, now-a-days they even have on-line tutors and on-line colleges! Professor @PERSON2 states that @PERCENT1 of passing college students are earning their degree online. This is a fabulous point on why computers are so important. Lastly, computers are really significant to society because you are able to talk with other people online. With videochat, chatrooms, facebook and @CAPS2, you are bound to make a friend who would last a lifetime. I know I did! There are even on-line dating sites and matchmakers. For instance, after mu uncle divoriced my aunt, she was devastated and couldn't date again for the longest time. I told her to try one of those on-line dating sites, she took my advice and found a lovely man. They have been dating for @NUM1 months. Last @DATE1 he proposed. They are now happily engaged. This is my last reason how computers can change someone's life in a positive way. In conclusion, I think computers are a fantastic inevntion because you are able to learn about faraway places while staying at home. recieve help with your schoolwork, and talk with other people on-line. I really hope you will consider my opinion for your article, editor of the @ORGANIZATION1. Thank you for your time."	5	5		10																					
1524	1	"Many people have been talking about computers in the @ORGANIZATION1. Networks like @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS2 have be saying that the computers are turning the people in lazy goodd for notings. But I say different! I think the advances in technology is a good thing. Way? I'll give you @NUM1 reasons. My first reason is they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Next reason is makes life better. And my last reson is it give you hand-eye coordination @CAPS3't you sick of haveng to go to the book stor and find a book to do a project? well now with the computers you don't have to. You just go online and look up the info that you need to learn about almost anything form the use to @LOCATION1. Next reason is computers make life better."	3	3		6																					
1529	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I rencently started researching the effects that computers have on people an have found some shocking facts. I do not belive computers benefit society at all. Three reasons why I believe this is because it makes people lack exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends @CAPS1 is a rising problem in @LOCATION1 and a major factor towards @CAPS1 is computers. In fact statics so that people who spend more time exercising than looking at electronics all day actully live longer lives. So my first reason about why computers do not benfit society is that it lets people lack exercise. People need exercise to live and with computers it is becoming more lacking than ever. Also, exercise give you interfines a not more that makes you happy if you live your life exercising instead of watching or doing violant things on the web that will lead to a less violant future. My second reason is that computers cause a lack of enjoying nature. Nature is a beautiful thing filled with simmering lakes, the beautiful scent of balsam fine, and thosands of creatures. With computers thoshands of kids are missing out on the fresh air and adventures that nature has in store. My parents didn't have computers when they were little and they say that they enjoyed running around their neighborhoods playing sports and other fun activities. Finally, computers lack in interacting with friends. Remember when you were little and you called up your friend to hang out and sleepover, well now computers have caused people not to have to call or hang out with friends. Instead you can just @CAPS2 or email them and @CAPS3 you can have a conversation without even looking at a person! In closing, computers cause a lack in exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends. Please help and encourage others to help me put a stop to computers! Thank you for your time and I hope you learned some shocking and interesting facts from this letter. "	4	4		8																					
1538	1	"A lot of people use computers today. But not everybody thinks they benifit society. But computers can do anything! You can do reaserch, you can play games, and most of all, be free. Were you ever given a school project to do, but no book has the information you want? Well the internet does. A lot of computers are connected to the interact where you can find anything! Are you trying to find facts for your science project? Just go on your favorite search engine and search your topic. You'll find endless pages on anything. Even if your not doing school work, you can find anything on the internet. Did you forget the number of your favorite football player? Search his name and it'll tell you right on your screen. Are you wondering why the @CAPS1 won the @CAPS2 @CAPS3? Your choices are endless! Even if your computer doesn't have internet, you can play games. Playing games on your computer is a great hobbie! And if you are connected to the internet, you can play games with other people around the world. Playing games on your computer is a great hobbie, but you cant play all the time, you need to find other things to do to. There are a variety of computer games. Adventure games, shooting games multiple player games, and more! You can even play poker on your computer. I think the best part of any computer is your freeness while on one. You can do almost anything. You can go on the internet, play games and even talk with people. You can also customize your computer to your liking. Do you have a picture of your cat? You can put it as your background on the desktop. Want a different curser, you can change that to! You can change anything you want with just a click on your mouse. There you go, there are endless possibilities with computers. You can learn, play, and be free. But the most important part of using a computer is to enjoy it, and have fun!"	4	5		9

Im going to explane why within the most few paragraphs. First I would like to start off by saying its good that people are into computers and working with them because that books their learning activities and they learn new thinngs and it will help them be sucessfull in life, people play games, cross word puzzles, riddles, and many more. Same use the internet for ingredence, car parts, ect. Next, useing computers is very helpful to the human race because it will effect students school, parents/guardians/teens. It will effect and lots of schools are useing computers now and exspecialy students to do their. It effects parents, beca use it will sucess them in life and help them find jobs, with their jobs. Finally their getting enuff exercise because their going to bed, their eating, they go to school, work, or do something for the day that involves walking. Nobody just sits home and does nothing those days. Theirs always something to do or a place to go. Well I hope you think about what I told you and take it into consideration.

1550	1	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 people use computers but not every one agress that it benefits society. In my opinion, computers benefit society. There are @CAPS1 websites that can help you find information. Computers also allow people to work easily. A third reason is @CAPS1 companies are able to use them to gain business. If you are doing a project or need to look up information about something, the internet is one of the easiest ways to find that information. Google.com has so much information about almost any topic you can think of. If you are a teenager that doesn't have a drivers license and there is no one to take you to the library, computers allow you to be able to hand in the report/project on time. There are also websites that find you direction, to where you need to go. Mapquest.com is a quick and easy way to help you figure out which way to go. Computers allow people to easily. If your family member lives far away and you don't have enough money for the phone bill, computers help you to not loose touch. There are websites that can help you keep in contact with old friends that you don't see anymore. Computers are one of the only ways that people fighting in the wars can talk to their relatives. They are not able to have phones and sending a letter can take a long time. Companies use computers for easy access to the public. If you are a new company, you can put a little ad on the sicle of the screen on yahoo.com and millions of people will see it. They of so use computers to make flyers easily and quickly. Making a hundred flyers by hand can take hours. But on the computers all you have to do is make one and then you can print out one-hundred. Using computers helps society. you can easily find what you are looking for and you are able talk to anyone you want. Also, it is easy for companies to attract business. Those are only a few of the @CAPS1 reasons why computers are good for society."	4	4		8																					
1553	1	"Dear local newpaper: @CAPS1 you being the local newspaper, you have the power to say how you feel about the effects computers give to people. I believe that computers give great effects to people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it allows you to talk to people. In all, @PERCENT1 of people agree with my idea about computers. Firstly, using computers teaches people about hand-eye coordination. For example, my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer. This is because she types and researches information all day long. In all, computers are designed to help your eyes and hands to focus more. Secondly, computers have a lot of interesting information on faraway places. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 quotes, ""I always use computers for my work because it helps me learn about many new things. @CAPS2, it lets my wife and I search details about a trip we want to go on."" @CAPS2, the people agree with what @PERSON1 stated. However, people @MONTH1 say that computers give the wrong information many times, but if you find a wonderful website, it will never lie to you. Thirly, if you use computers it will let you talk online or video chat with friends or family all over the world. How this benefits you is because if you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them, then video chat. It has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way. @CAPS2, instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes, go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat. Lastly, taking to people and being active in other peoples life is important. In conclusion, you will have great eye coordination, you will be able to research faraway places, and you will always be allowed to video chat or talk to family online. @CAPS2, I want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful and people use them everyday without a problem. Lastly, you will have the best feeling ever if you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot!"	3	4		7																					
1554	1	"Computers? Have you ever thought of how a computer is made or how every small part of a computer is installed? Well, unfortunately I don't have the answers to these questions but I do have another quistion for you to think about. Are computer's bad for you? Well, I think that they arn't because first of all, they teach us hand-eye coordination, give people the chance to learn about places and people that they have never seen or even heard of, and lastly the allow people to talk to faraway relatives or friends without ever having to go to them. As I was say in before, the computer gives people good eye-coordination. For example people usually are not very good catching a ball at first but of course if you keep on practicing you will get better. Same thing with the computer, at first you arnt very good or fast at typing but if you keep practicing you will gradually get quicker at it. Then this good habit will help you while your at school or at work. Second the computer gives people the ability to learn about places or people that they have never seen or heard about. For example some people might have yet not heard the warter falls, trails, or food's from @ORGANIZATION1. Another example is that mabey some people might not know about the belly dance came from @LOCATION1. or the big dragon came from @LOCATION2. The excelant source to find out all these things in a quick amount of time without having to . The computer is also excellent for elderly people are in weel chairs and can't take too much . Lastly, it let's people talk to far away relatives or family members online. This is better because then mabey a father went on a busines trip to another country and talking on the phone is really satisfying also you can forget about sending letters. It is always nice to greet a father, a mother, or even distant cousin online were you can see how much they have grown. I hope you you have taken my side on this judgement for it is very important to me. Please remember my three reasons and don't forget that this includes you to."	4	4		8

It help us communicate better get imformation quicker and entertain us. Computer have a very positive effect on us.

For instance, say @CAPS1 you wanted to talk to a friend in @LOCATION1, all you have to do is go on a social networking site and talk with them. Also, @CAPS1 you have relatives who live across the country, you could use webcam to talk with them. When you can talk to people from around the world. You can learn alot more about other countries culture and other cities way of life. Finally, @CAPS1 a relative is away, you can still talk to your uncle or grandma, the relationship just gets better. The internet and computers are a wealth of information. With all of the search engines on the internet you can findout how tall a maple tree is or , how to lose weight. Others @MONTH1 say that sitting down and not moving while learning is bad, but you could search about family activities nature walks and new and exciting excersises. When students need information on a school project, they can go on and search it instead of going over to the library. As a result of the internet, people are smarter. Because of the internet there is basically no more boredom. Kids and adults alike are not bored. Boredom is bad, because kids will do anything to stop it. When the computer came, people could plaly games, watch @CAPS2.V. and movies, and do business. @CAPS1 you missed you favorite @CAPS2.V. Show you can go online and watch them. @CAPS1 you need to mail a letter to @LOCATION2, e-mail comes into place, and you mail will never be slow. And finally, you can play many, many games on the internet to keep up that eye hand coordination. With all of these exceptionally great things, we can all live in a happier, better world. Theres information quicker, communication better, and entertainment better. All of the search were in a very good world."	4	4		8																					
1560	1	"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you want people to be so memorized by a computer that they miss out in the world around them? @CAPS1 you want the kids in @LOCATION1 to spend hours each day on the computers playing games while they could be outside getting fresh air? The question then is, @CAPS1 computers have good effects or bad effects on people. The obvious answer is bad effect. People constantly use the computers teach them bad habbits and can search inappropriate things. IF people are always playing games the computers then when @CAPS1 they go out for a jag. The answer is never. People who are constantly on the computer don't get enough exercise. One reason why a lot of people in @LOCATION1 are obese is because they aren't getting enough exercise. Computers aren't helping this situation at all. Some people say, ""@CAPS2 I'll just spend an hour on the computer and then I will go work out."" But, the one hour on the computer turns into two hours, and then two hours turns into three, you know it you've wasted the wrote day on the computer and didn't exercise at all. Also, there are so many games on the computer now that can be really and you don't to stop playing them. Yes some games can be really entertaining, but you don't have to spend all day playing them. You can play a fun game for fifteen minutes and then go get air. As you can computer can mesmorised a lot so they don't get enough exercise. Second, people go on bad habbits. For example, kids are always. On the website you can talk to your friends. On the computer the problem is that people dont use the. Too much and get too used writing like that. Then, kids @MONTH1 start doing that on writing in school and most even know it. Also, there are new websites where you can put personal information about yourself. This makes it easy for strangers to. learn your. Lastly is very easy for people, even to search inappropriate things. Everything is on the internet and little kids are going to be very curious about it. They can search inappropriate words ad pictures and no one would ever know. people can past inappropriate information on their own for others to see that can be impossible to take. And, if parents don't know that their children are searching inappropriate things, then the kids are going to keep doing it because they know they wont get caught. So, as you can see computers have a very negative effect on people. It causes individuals to no easy to inappiopriate things. So go and limit the time you on computer."	5	4		9																					
1570	1	"Yes, I believe that computers benefits society because you can talk to other people, it helps you learn and lastly compoters are apart of todays technology. First of all, computers have really progressed from the old type writer we used to have. Computers have helped todays life for a few different reasons. With computers, they help us learn or find things we didnt know. For example, if you have a project due on the @LOCATION1, then most likley you're probably not going to know much about it. If you go to the internet then you can find tons of things about it like who and what needs the @ORGANIZATION1 for water, how long the @LOCATION1 is, where its located or anything else abot it. Also, another reason why computers help us learn is that, say your going to a new job interview and you have no idea where it is or how even to get there. If you type in the adress and the internet will give you directions. Even if you dont know when your favorite to show is on tonight just type that in and the answer will be right in front of you. Secondly, why I believe that computers do benefits society is you can talk to other people from across the state, country, or world, or even just down the street. Facebook and @CAPS1 are very helpful as well, because one of my best friends moved away in second grade. Just before about christmas i found her on facebook and now we talk and catch up because we havent seen each other in years, @CAPS2 alone tak to her. Another reason why is that if someones mon or dad is away at war or oversea's then the kids and parents could talk to them by using email, skype, yahoo instant messenger, with the webcam or the telephone just @CAPS2 alone just typing back and fourth. You could also just use it for a job buisness to talk to your co-worker or one of your workers on webcam to see things are going with profit, stores, etc. Lastly, why I think computers actually do help us is technollogy has come a long way. For example if you had to type something up you would of have to used a type writer and those things are hard to use. Today you just have to go onto @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and type it out. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 also has spell check, you could email it to someone, or even change the font, color, size of the font and much more. Another reason why is with iphones or i touches now you dont have to be at home you could take out either one and just use the internet for whatever you want to. To find an app, find how long the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 is, or even just to order a pizza but technollogy has come a long way. So this is why I agree with that computers help benefit our society because you can talk to other people, it helps you learn new things you didnt knew before and finally computers have changed a lot and they are apart of our technology. "	6	5		11																					
1582	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I @CAPS3't you agree that computers benefit society? I sure do. I find my computer benefits the society because you can interact with others online. Its easy to find entertainment and @CAPS4 is extremely helpful and profitable. Now you @MONTH1 not beleive computers are "" Society friendly"" but I am here to argue that statement. Now, one thing I love about computers is now easily you can interact with people whether they're miles away or right in your neighborhood, you could chat with them in the push of a button. For instance, my friends all have the infamous? Facebook account. All I have to do is go online, click my chat box and click their name and then @CAPS5! were talking. And the better part is you @CAPS3't have to share any personal details ( @CAPS6 @CAPS7, phone number etc..) to chat on facebook. Wow wasn''t that easy? Did you ever turned on your @CAPS8. scanned through channels and say ""@CAPS9 goods on @CAPS8?"" @CAPS11, with a computer. theres always something to watch. Whethe @CAPS4 old a new, fake a real, live or not, the computer has many things tool/ watch. You could pull up your @CAPS12 browser and go on @CAPS13 (A video site) and watch their wonderful variety of filling. There are atleast @NUM1 million videos on @CAPS13 and @NUM2 being watched/uploded per day. Infact the ""@CAPS14"" views @NUM3+ video a day without noticing @CAPS4. If your looking for stand up, you could type in ""@CAPS15 @CAPS16! If you're looking to action, you type in chan . Basically, the computer and the bad wide web things to do. Now, @CAPS17 stating those two things, @CAPS4 has come to my attention that the computer is also extremely helpful. Say if you have an extremely big test/report due tomorrow, you can study for @CAPS4 online. You can go on google and type in your projects subject and get over @NUM4 results in a fraction of a second depending on your bandwidth. Now, the computer is also profitable. Did you know the two people who made google are dirt rich? They made more than the @ORGANIZATION1 and the company @ORGANIZATION1 makes the mostly used computer system. So once again, the computer is extremely helpful and profitable. This is exactly why I beleive the computer benefits the society. The computer lets you interact with other, keeps you entertained and is very helpful and profitable. So quite frankly, you should beleive that the computer is society benefitcial. Thank you for your time."	5	5		10																					
1593	1	"As the people of the world are starting to use the computer more and more, I think it has a extremely positive effect on people. Computers are not all fun and games they help with other things as well. For example, some of the amazing things the computer are; teach hand-eye coordination. give people all over the world a chance to learn about the places, people and culture from far away places, and last hit not least, it is another way to allow people to talk online with their friends. Now let me explaine more about what a positve effect the computer is for the millions of people that use one. The computer today is such a great thing to have in your house. It is not for just ga off and playing video games on, it is also very helpful in the education of young children, teens, parents, and even grandparents. when you use the computer there os so much you can learn. For instance lets say you have a in your socical or history about the country or and you don't know a thing about it. What do you do? You should log onto you computer find a reliable website and boom you are learning facts about @LOCATION1 that you would have never know until you logged onto the computer. The computer is also a great way to practice and get better using your hand-eye coordination. First you need to learn about the of the keys and where they are positioned on the keyboard. After you have that skills, you should try to look at the computer screan. and not be working down at you finger keys. Not only is that not helping you hand-eye coordination, but it is causing you to type much slower than you would if you were looking at the screen. The computer truely is unbelievable. Are you one of those people who's parents don't you get a phone because use of how much it costs without even the cost of texting? Well if you are, the computer help you out with that problem aswell!! There are bunches of different ways to talk to your friends and family on the computer. For example, you could use @CAPS1 to instant your friends or facebook to learn more and more about somebody. The comp. is so hanndy! So lets recap on what we learned! The computer helps people learn about different places all over the world helps w/ hand-eye coordination, and lets you talk to your friends! I think the comp is a in every household."	5	5		10																					
1594	1	"Dear @CAPS1, many people say that computers can have an bad effect on people. I came to disagree computers make our lives so much easier. We can talk to people that we have not seen in a while, we can read/see other places we thought we would never know about; And insted of having to hand write that book we can typr it up. I find these are resons that show that computers don't have a bad effect on people. Imagin you are on facebook and you type in your best friend from high schools name she pops up and you a on net. The next day she is on happy you are connected. Thats she kind of thing that happens everday people reconnect, this not only happens on facebook, not all over the internet! Reconecting with friends and family, talking to your boss on next door you can even send a picture of your new born baby to your mother who lives in @CAPS2. Having computers really allows us to reconect to these we have lost. Other are very inportant. But what if we know nothing about other cultures then what would life be like with computers we can instantly learn about other unlike having to go to the ad you have to do is type in the place and pick the size you want to look at all with using computers. @LOCATION1 ago people would have to write our everthing word by word letter by letter. Not with computers. So dont worry that @NUM1 page paper, you can just type it and with some softwear, you can even your paper edited right on the spot. This is great for not only school, children but adult to. That dissnes proposle can be done quickly and easily with computers. Many people say that computers can have a bad effect on people. But with advancing technology site gets easier, and the gives more time other things. There is no bad effect of computers. The effects is just helpful ness."	4	4		8																					
1596	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I agree that computers had a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination give the ability to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk online with other people. More people should see computers as a positive effect on people. Spending time on a computer is a great way to enhance your hand-eye coordination. It also teaches you how to type fast. Typing is an important skill that you need for most jobs. It is so important that have throuhout school teaching us how to type. we also use hand-eye coordination is loaded and. You have to keep your eye on the and move your arms and hands to hit the. Computers are helpful in many ways. Have you ever about what looks like or what would be found on it? With a computer you can. Comuputers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. You can get pictures some important cities and places, and some knowledge on the people who lies there. Yes, you would do this in a social studies look buts is much easier and faster online. Computers save time and make your life easier. Computers are learning more and more advanced everyday. They give you the oppurtunity to talk with people online whether the world the street. In order to do this you need a web. They are sold in computer stores and some are already installed into the computer. Being able to talk with people online is a really great thing. Its a fast way to learn about that person and maybe about them if they one from a different country. Its almost like a pen pal last your in a computer. People are saying that computers have a negative effect on people. They say people are spanding to much time an computer and not on exercise. They also say that they are not interacting with family and friends. All of these things should be. All you have to do is manage your time. Or not all day on the computer. If you do this thinks everyone will say that computer your positive effect and are one of the last invention created. I would like to thanks all f the reader for there time and hope hat you all support me and my ideas."	4	5		9																					
1599	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are not necessary. Some believe that they help us learn, but I just say so do books. Some people believe @CAPS2 can help to be more hand eye coordinated, so does playing catch. Most believe that internet teaches about people in faraway places, I say why not visit those places then you'll know more than what was typed in a computer. @CAPS2 it was computers against books I definetly would conqure with whomever roots for books. A good book is healthy. To me, reading a book on the computer is one of two things, unhealthy and unethnical! You can't read a book on the computer and even @CAPS2 you could it is not as fun as turning the pages of a beautiful paperback or hard-covered book. I Believe that you can learn so much from what you read in a book, (A real book)! When you type on a computer, do all that, ""clickety, clickety""!, you say that it's learning because you learn to type without looking, hand-eye coordination. I say no! that is not natural. Why not go out side and throw a ball to one another? That's a real way to show hand-eye coordination. It's a fun game and it's easy, plus it teaches hand-eye coordination. When you want to surf the web to find a nice vacation spot, you should really just visit that place. Flip a coin heads @LOCATION3 tails @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 you pick heads, stop surfing the web to get info on that place!. go fly there and surf the totaly radical waves. Surf the real waves next the artificial ones dudes! So as I restate, computers might seem okay and i guess they aren't all bad, but they are not my cup of coffee. So take time away from that computer and go read a book or play a game of catch. You know what hows about a trip to @LOCATION4 or @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION3. Who knows, it will definetly be an experience, for sure."	4	5		9																					
1602	1	"Dear editor, Computers have a good effect on humans. The reason is because you can interact with friends and family that they know, the computer @MONTH1 be portable so you can still get outside, and lastely people can research places where they want to go on vacation. These reasons are how computers have a good effect on humans. To begin with, seeing people in person is not the only way to communicate, on the computer there is many ways. There are chat rooms, that have typing to eachother. Take my friend @PERSON5 for example, he used to live in @LOCATION2 with all his friends and family until buisiness came along. His buisiness transfered @PERSON5 all the way to @LOCATION1. Thank god he had a computer, because other wise he would not have able to communicate with his friends. @PERSON5 is not the only person in which he is transfered far away from home. In fact, @PERSON4 showed @PERCENT1 of people with a computer tend to talk to friends and family more often because they can do it whenever they need. Gene a phsychyatrist states that when someone in a family has to leave to go on buisiness, then that family will start relying on a computer to communicate. Do you want to lose a friend or family member? Moreover, computers @MONTH1 be portable. If a computer is portable then you can see nature and still use the computer to get the job done. Take my cousin @PERSON2 is a teacher and always has to do his students grades during the weekend. He was bummed out because he could never get outside. So for his birthday, he got a portable computer, this allowed him to go outside and do his job while getting fresh air and seeing nature. @PERSON2 is one of many lucky people that has had this happen to them. @PERSON6 has shown that @PERCENT2 of teachers buy portable computers so they can see nature and get fresh-air while doing their job. @PERSON1, proved that if a teacher doesn't get any fresh air while doing their job then they can make a valuable mistake or even get sick. Would you, a teacher, want to get sick with no fresh air or be healthy working out doors? Lastly, there is more to do on computers than doing work and communicating with friends and family. You can research places for vaction. My aunt @PERSON3 had always dreamed of going on vacation but couldn't find any information on fun, outdoor places. Until, she got her hands on a computer. This way she found a fun place and left the country for week. @PERSON3 is not the only person this has happened to. In fact, @ORGANIZATION1 shows that @PERCENT3 of people hesitate to go on vaction because they don't know about the country or place."	5	5		10																					
1616	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1, Computers have advanced our world so far into the future that practically everything is just a click away. Experts are awed that over the years, computers have helped billions of people get jobs done foster and smoother than ever before. Technology has helped doctors find new cures for patients, and diagnose their sicknesses in a more advanced way. Thousands of professions require the limitless knowledge of the internet, and computers continue to advance and redefine our way of living. Furthermore, kids of all ages benefit from modern computers. As technology becomes more user-friendly, children have adapted to computers giving them answers to all of their questions. As a student at @ORGANIZATION1, I have found that computers are vital in everyday assignments. Essays are now typed and not handwritten and projects are displayed on flash drives, not posterboard. Those advances have shaped our lives, and made everything much easier. Also, foreign places become closer to home, when computers allow you to virtually visit hundreds of different countries. With modern technology, the world is better connected and united. In addition to students, doctors also greatly benefit from computers. Technology has re-shaped the medical world dramatically with x-rays, @CAPS2's, surgeries and medicines. Amazingly, computers allow doctors and nurses to look at patients in a whole new way. Hospitals organize all records digitally to help give the right treatments patients. @PERSON1, the head surgean at @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""@CAPS3 technology, our @ORGANIZATION2 would be useless. We wouldn't be able to do anything."" @CAPS4 @PERSON1 is well-spoken, he makes a very important point. Computers are the building blocks of our medical world. Scientific studies have shown that the internet has brought people closer than ever before. Families separated by thousands of miles now have the ability to email, chat or even video chat with far away relatives and friends. Email has especially played a huge roll in our society, so as to help millions of people communicate when needed. Infact, over @NUM1 million jobs rely on email to communicate important business information. @CAPS3 the aid of technology, our economy would rapidly as communication countries failed to exist. Computers are essential to our culture. I strongly urge you to consider my opinion on the benefits of modern technology and think of all the people computers have helped. Our culture is now bigger, better, faster and stronger, thanks to the help of technology today. Knowing this, I vehimently suggest you educate others in the benefit of technology and play your part in advancing our way of living."	4	5		9																					
1621	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you belive that the advances in our technology are not good for our society you must be misunderstanding computers have a positive affect on the people in our community by giving us well hand and eye coordination and giving us the ability to seek and find information to learn. It can also allow people to communicate online with others. Hand and eye coordination is an important thing that helps us everyday. @CAPS2 new technology such as computers, can help us with that skill, we should use it. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""Computers do help us a lot; almost @PERCENT1 of active computer users do improve their hand and eye coordination just by using the computers for a small amount of time everyday."" @CAPS3 and education are essential, especially now; the more you learn, the better salary you get. With this new technology, you can earn degrees and learn in a short period of time. My aunt got her @CAPS4 online about six months ago, and just because of that, got promoted at her job. Gaining valuable @CAPS3 online doesn't just go for adults but children as well. @CAPS2 they have a report on @CAPS5 or need some help on their homework, these new technologies are one of the most effective, fastest ways to learn and find information. @PERSON2, a doctor that specializes in @CAPS6 emotions/feelings says in the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 last month that, ""in this new millenium, preteens and teenagers simply love the new advances in technology, and @CAPS2 we want them to learn, then we can take this tool and have them use it."" Computers are also a great way to communciate it's fast and easy. I have an uncle who lives in @LOCATION1, and we rarely get to see each other due to the distance, som we catch up by messaging each other by social netwroks or emails. It's even free, unlike the costly long distance calls. The communication is also great for businesses. A company can reach out and contact their customers to reschedule an appointment, give receipts, advertist and many other things. Computers are essential and effective techorlogy that are use by people around the country and world. They improve hand-eye coordination, allow people to gain @CAPS3 and education, and gives people opportunity to communicate with others. this is another great and useful step in our communities around the world."	5	5		10																					
1628	1	"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are great for our society. Computers have a positive effect on people. They teach to people hand-eye cordination, and about places all over the world. Computers are also great for talking online to family and friends. Computers teach people hand-eye cordination. They help people to get familiar with looking at a screen and typing letters to form words. Computers are excellent for students that play the piano, like me. It helps you to be able to look at the music and have your fingers know where to play. The computers helps with the piano because they both involve you looking at a screen, or music. While your fingers know what to do. So I think computers helps children and teens to have better hand-eye cordination. Computers are also very helpful to everyone because it is great for researching facts, or even just looking for somewhere to go on vacation. Say you just got home from school, and your teacher had assigned you to write a two page paper on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You would not be able to do it by memory, you would need facts. So you should go to the library, but no one can take you. Well if you have a computer, it is a great way to research a topic for school. You don't have to leave your home, you can even stay in your pajamas. Computers give you the information that you need. Or if your planning a vacation in @LOCATION1, and don't know where to stay, then the internet will get you right there and give you great opptions. Another thing computers are great for is talking. How so you say, well you can got to A.I.M. online. You can have conversations with all your friends and family. This year my brother, and my closest cousin to me, went to college. Now I only see them about twice a year, it is so quiet without them, especially at my house. If I want to ever talk with my brother, it is great like he is in my home again. He sends me pictures of his college, friends, and any fun places that he goes. So without computers I would practically never see my brother, or talk to him. Local newspaper please consider my opinion, I feel that computers benefit are society. They leave a positive effect on people in the community and world. Computers teach teens, and children excellent hand-eye cordination, and helps people like me to play the piano more smoothly and exact. Computers are also great for looking up facts for school when the library is not available. The internet also keeps me closer to my brother, whose in college, because we can chat and send pictures to each other. So please take my opinion into consideration. Thank you."	5	5		10																					
1630	1	"Has a computer helped you ever answerd hard question or type up an essay for school for work? I know a computer has helped me far years so why would I teminate it or want it gone. Heres the controversy, many experts believe computers don't benefit society but people, such as myself, believe the exact oppositte. Their are many benefits to oconing a computer such as they're always a source of information, allow you to talk online with others, and they can help people with their school and job loans. No matter what the problem, don't you believe a computer is always a source of information that could help? A computer has endless information on any topic unlike books. This is because everyone, from the most to the least intelligent people, have their opinions, ideas, and hard facts in a computer on the web. I once watched a movie of a man who despised computers and new technology. Thus, for most of his life he wondered the world with no hint or clue as where to @CAPS4 in search of a rare artifact called the @CAPS1 diamon. He never found the diamond but his son who searched it on the internet found out the root geo from @CAPS1 meant underground in ancient @CAPS2 culture. due to a computer he found the diamond underground, beneath the ancient @CAPS2 temples. Therefore, I believe if people would embrace technology such as computers they would find many things that they never thought of. also, computers give you the ability to chat online with family and friends. Many people use computers to stay in touch when they have no available phones, with a computer you could chat with your friend down the street or your family member on vacation in another country. No matter where you are a compute can always be on available form of communication. for example, the only way many of our soldiers fighting wars stay in touch with their loved ones back home is by talking to them online with a computer. One thing I know is no matter how old to probably about @NUM1, if you have a job or go to school you have used a computer to help you with @CAPS4. Whether it was getting an answer to a homework question or researching a person for a project, we all use computers. Computers even have the ability to help you make brochures or pamphlets. This can greatly help you advertise if that is something you do at work. Also, many people don't have the neatest handwriting so they type their essay or letter to their boss, you can even choose what type of handwriting it types. No matter the case, with work a computer always helps. Yes, I do believe computers benefit the society. Althourgh, some experts do disagree with me and believe they can become an addition. Still take my suggestions seriously and continue to use your computer. Remember, it is always a source of info., you can chat online, and it helps with work."	5	5		10

And it is also a great way to learn information on topics and places very far off. Being able to talk to relatives from far away places is very important. @PERCENT1 of experts say that having a close knit family will give kids a greater chance of going to college. I understand why some people think ""well why doesn't the "" I grew up in a big family and just the whole day the phone was getting used. The computer has a lot of fun games that you can play. I see why you might think that the computer is why kids are over-weight But isn't the hour on the computer. Its eating habbits. Studies show that computers are use in the winter two time as much then. Going on the internet to learn new information is a great way to useing your souce. Just imagine this you straight A student comes home for the weekend about to do the biggest project lige forgets to bring home the most important book. She is flipping out looking all over the place and hyperventalating. But if you had a computer your daughter would be able to get the proect done and go to the college of her dreams. But since you didn't buy a computer she is going to fail her class not accepted to harvard and settle for the local community college where maybe one day she will be able to transfer. So I've gave you reasons to go out and but a computer you just lost to go do it. Do you want your kids to interact with aunt sally who lives @NUM1 miles away. Also it is a great way to play games.

1633	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I think that computers affect our country in a positive way. Three reasons why I think so are comunication, @CAPS2, entertainment and, @CAPS3. One of my favorite things to do is talk and when on of my best friends moved away and I lost his phone number I thought we had no way of doing it. One day he requested me on facebook and from there on we have been comunicating on web sites like facebook, myspace and, skype. My second reason why computer's benifit our society is @CAPS2. At my dad's house I do not have a television so I rely on the internet to keep me informed on what is going on in the world. A website called @CAPS4.com was the frist to anounce @PERSON1's death befor anyone even suspected it. Stories like that often break rest on the internet. The third reason why computers benefit our society is entertainment. You can watch videos, play games, listen to music, comunicate with friends. The last reason why computers benefit our society is @CAPS3. Many @CAPS3 in our comunity require computer skills such as a acountant, a manager, software designner, and a computer programer. The computer make @CAPS3 and more eficient by correcting mistakes, providing a visual and typeing.

I believe that people should be more aware of the time they are in the computers. Instead of ruining your eyes you should be exercising, enjoying, and being with family and friends. Exercising is a major part of every persons life and if you don't get enough of it you could become obeise. Obeisity @MONTH1 cause people to not like you or think that you are a slob. Although you might say that you don't care what others think, but in the long run it might be a mistake if you think this way. exercise will most likely rid you of almost any type of discrimination because you will look no different or even better than the average person. If you ever get the chance get a telescope and set it up in a spot where you can see the stars at night. Instead of keeping your eyes glued to the computer on a nice, sunny joy, go for a walk in the woods. As you can see, nature is much more beautiful than hundreds of tiny tots of colors forming an image of nature. If you find an image of a beautiful plant, why not go and see or feel the plant 'in person? Many programs are now available on computers that let you see people, but wouldn't you rather talk to him or her in real life? I sure would and I think most other people would as well. @PERCENT1 of the population of @LOCATION1 said that they would much rather talk to friends or relatives in person than on a computer screen. I feel that however possible, you should always talk to people in person and not through cameras and wires. I hope I have made myself clear that exercising, nature, and people in real life are all much better options than being in front of a computer for the rest of your life."	4	4		8

It supply's an easy access to information along with preparing skills for future generations. And giving from lifes sometimes to cruel days through gamming.

1641	1	"People the computer is something good and cool. Why is cool? is cool because the computer help you in everything. I have reasons. The first reasons is when in your school you have homework, work, project or something like that the computer help you a lot. Because in the computer you can sign in internet and you go to google or other web side. The second reason is the computer help you in your house for example: You have the big problem with your car or something like that. You can go in the computer in @LOCATION1 and the you see the pieces of your car. The thrid reason for the computer is so cool is because in this time you can make the everything thing. We can go the web and facilitate our life. Now you can realize the work, homework, project, ideas, writting book, chat, information, print picture, and ect... And that you are architect you can make your proper work or house you see the computer is so cool. But some people use the computer for bad thing for example: for pornography or something bad this is not cool and is not appropiate for people. The computer is something fabolous and super genius. My opinion is that the computer help a lot is something like need in our life. No for live but for our life or something @CAPS1. Something you can see your family for webcam. This is fabolous but don't used the webcam for something bad you can learn thing that you don't know. I think that for this reason you used the computer for good thing. Appraise the computer. Please."	4	4		8																					
1647	1	"Dear newspaper, Technology is a very useful thing But is also a bad thing, it makes people lazy on . A computer is a multi-use tool. Along with this people cango on any website . Anything, as in research or personal reasons. First off, let me point out that computers are useful multi-purpose tools. Computers can also, @CAPS1 people slugish bor lazy. i feel this way because, to many people sit infront of computer instead of getting up & being active. Being acive gad and important for people. A lot of people are not active because they on the computer harms on end. Students sometimes go home and strayht oor tug computer instead of doing homework. Moreover, computers can help you pay bills. Do research, or maybe just for fun play games. There is an ulimeted number of websites & to cp on through to hep you with many of needs. Uploading family pictures from your last vacation? its simple with most computer soft . Finally, computers is kind of like one . They can even become a blank just waiting for a pinest of insparation."	3	3		6																					
1650	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 would a person do with out a computer? Well I think nothing because @CAPS1 if you are like me that have their family far away in another country well whith a computer you can see them throught a camara and talk to them just like if you where there. Computers just don't take your time they help you understand the menning of a family.These are many reasons why I think computers should be very important. My first reason is that they give you information about a place that you might be interested to see or know their culture. There are many people that like to explore and see new places, but they can't because maybe they just don't have time or they might have to much work. There is no exception for someone to not put their oportunities out, just because they don't have the time or a computer. My second reason is work. People like you that work in a office need information about a place that a disaster happened. You might need somenthing to see how it happen and @CAPS1 was the condition it happend. People that work in a important place need a computer because they are saving their work so they don't lose it and get fired. My third and last reason is to be organized. Being organized is very important it helps you keep a job or having everything on hand. Well computers are not just a pass of time it also makes your life easier. Many people say that they don't @CAPS1 to have to much papers; with a computer you can have all those paper in just one page that is saved by you, and only you can see it. As you @MONTH1 see many people that have computers use it in a productive way. It's not just a pass of time like people say it is. It also helps you do many stuff for your own future: not just to play around with some new friends. Well as you @MONTH1 see this are my three main reasons for keeping a computer in your house and using it in a good and productive way. "	4	4		8																					
1661	1	"I remember when computer wernt so popular. Back then I had to write my essays and listen to music on the radio. Now computers are very popular. I believe that computers have positive effect on people @DATE1 because students need them for school, you can use them for other things, and lastly it is easy to acess them. You will know that computers are good for our society! Most students use the computers to type college essays, project etc. Which is good because its much easier. For example im a student that can't draw so printed some pictures of the computer so I can paste them on my post board. So in the other words the computer is useful for students. I know @NUM1 out of @NUM2 colleges expect students to turn in there assignements threw the computers or its a zero. In this society theres no time for zeros because when you are in college your still paying for the class even if your failing or not. So basically its a waste of money. So the computer can save us from failing! People these days use computers for pleasure. Usually messaging people on myspace, facebook, twitter, and other social networks. Which is kind of intersting because you can up with friend that you haven't seen in years. As you can see the internet has its advantaes because you would have nvever thought you will see your friend doing. Another thing about computers that you can fint stuff cheaper than everyday lif say if you want to a trip and you call @ORGANIZATION1 for your ticket. The ticket came up to . But you go on the computer and you on @ORGANIZATION1 website and find your ticket to florida the price will most likely be a couple hundred dollars less. Since we are in a restion we will need those couple hundred dollars for savings. Computers are everywhere You can find one at school, home, a cafe or even on your cell phone. Which is good because you can use them at your own convince. At home if my labtop is free I can go on it and be on it for hours playing games. Also, I remember when my computer broke and I wanted to go on the computer so badly. So I realized that I can go on the computer at the library. I was so happy because it was no cost to me. To sum up computers have a positive effect on people. I seriously don't know what to do if I didn't have one because students need them, you can do other things on it, and lastly its easy to acess one! In this generation everybody is rushing and computers."	5	5		10																					
1664	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I have been using my computer for a long time now. I didn't have one growing up, but I got one last year. Ther has been people saying tht the computer is good and it helps you stay in contact with friends and family it helps you learn about everything and you can look up the news. I totally agree with this. But some people don't like the computer because they spend more time on it then going outside. Here are ny thoughts on the computer. First of all, teh computer is a great way to look up the news. You can find more news and weather faster then you can on teh television. if you want to find the news, just got to awebsite that you think has news. I am find out what weather is today, what happens throughout the day that @MONTH1 be shocking to everyone, and find out about celebrities. All this at a push of a button, and a click of the mouse. Secondly, the computer is like a tutor. Either your having trouble on homework, or you just want to knoe a simple fact, the computer is for you. Just search up soemthing you want to know on a search engine and you will have your answer. This amy not seen that important, but it is when you are anxious to learn. Lastly, the computer is the famous way of communicating around the globe. Whether it's facebook, myspace, aim, you can tlak to your distant or close family and friends. You might think, ""oh tha's what a phone is for""? Well all of these websites are free. Yeah, I said it free. There is also skype. Skype is where you can actually see the person you are talking to. Yes, the wonderful world of technology. So now you know that a computer can teach you things. it can find you news, and it can help you communicate across the globe. Now your thinking, ""People spend too much time on the computers right""? This is where independnece comes in. Get off or it. it's your decision to stay on it, not the computers. Limit your time to a half hour a day. Go ourside, enjoy nature. AMybe do a little excercise. "	4	4		8																					
1665	1	"Dear @CAPS1, Advances in computer technology have positively affected the society we live in today. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, help kids learn inside and outside of school, and connect the world socially. These amazing devices have done nothing to harm the new generation. In fact, they have done quite the opposite. Computers are an excellent way of teaching hand-eye coordination. People who are opposed to using computers believe that all they do is make kids lazy and ignorant. This is not the case. The coordination gained from using the mouse games over to sports like baseball and lacross. Players have to look at an incoming ball, and guide their stick or mitt to catch the ball. As you can see, coordination is essential to sports. It is also needed for simple every day tasks around the house. These could be as plain as just taking out the trash or cooking meals. We overlook the fact they easy jobs like these still require coordination. A misplaced pot could pour boiling water on the floor and cause a huge mess. W are lucky that we live in a world with such a good teacher of hand-ey coordination. Computers are the worlds most knowledgeable teachers. No matter how hard you try if you are using a computer, you will learn something. The internet is a best cache of information. In the current day and age, the environment is a growing concern. Paper no made from trees, so must be cut down. It takes forty years for a tree to grow, and seconds to cut one down. Schools everywhere should use computer and keyboards for work instead of paper and pencil. Since most students are familiar with computers, they enjoy working with them more than writing. The average kid could learn more in an hour with a computer than they would whole day at school. The transiton needs to be made. Computers are also a massive social network. Instant messaging and @CAPS2 are now primary sources of communication. If it hasn't for computers, I wouldn't be able to talk to my friend that moved to @LOCATION2 two years ago. This is just one example of how social networks are helpful. They help people stay connected with old friends, and work. All major corporations use computers to invest, sell products, and store information. Computers are the ultimate way communicate. Obviously, computers are growing exponentially in popularity. The @LOCATION1 should put this to use. Imagine a more eco-friendly country where we don't have to cut down a million acres of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 rainforest every year. The benifits of computers are endless. Three of these are hand-eye coordination, knowledge and communication."	4	5		9																					
1668	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1; Technology seems to have a positive effect on people. But could it be a bad thing. The computer is one of the top uses by @CAPS2, but I think we spend a little to much time on it. My reasons are, kids and adults spend to much time on it, cant interact with friends or family and you cant enjoy nature. Dont get me wrong, its nice to meet new people on the internet and learn about other places. But when are you going to get your exercis of your on it for @NUM1 hours? Sometimes you can never get up because your eyes are stuck to the screen. As for food, you sit and eat junk food. You cant get a healthy meal if you eat chips & candy for hours. Instead up being blinded by the screen, you can get blinded from the sun outside by riding a bike. Its a great way to get fit, rather than typing and clicking away at your @CAPS3. Another way of getting fit, (than to sit) is going out for a run. Kids need about @NUM2 mins of cardio, so why not run your legs than your newest download? You work out your arms & your legs! My next reason why spending time on the computer too much is bad is because you wont have time for your friends or family. Are kids just going to sit at the computer all day while your family is having fun? Also, when you have chores to do, what will happen to them? The dishies will be dirty and your room will be a mess. Most of all wont you miss your friends? At this age kids/teens should be partying with friends and not gossiping online. No one would ever want to invite you anywhere because they will know you will be on the computer. Lastly, my final reason is the most simplest; enjoy nature explore the outside instead of living on the inside. Its good to go out once in a while and get a breathe of fresh air. If you havent visted the park in a while it would be great. Hear all the birds chirping and see the trees and flowers bloom! Then take a nice walk or stroll in the park. Your getting exercise & exploring nature too. While your at it, plant some flowers in your garden. This shows instead of buying games online, your buying seeds to help the environment. In conclusion, spending time on the computer is not bad, just dont spend hours-upon-hours on it. Kids will be kids, as well, adults will be adults. So take the considerations in hand. So try to get exercise, hang out with your friends & family, and enjoy nature!"	5	4		9																					
1669	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that the aspect of computers and their influence on people has been brought up. I personally feel that computers are a marvelous tool to help mankind advance. They provide infinite knowledge, entertainment, and dispite what the opposing side says, allow social interactions for those who don'@CAPS4 like to meet face to face. My first reason why computers benefit humans rather than hurt them is the knowledge they provide. Computers give access to the internet, which has near-infinitr amounte of knowledge stored inside @CAPS2. With a simple click of a button you have thousands of websites dedicated to answering your question. They can provide tons of information normally unobtainable. Take for example two students, one with a conputer are without. Both are given an assignment to write a report on a famous person. The one with the computer logs any searches for the reason, and in seconds has enough information to write numerous reports. He aces the reports, and continues to use this method. He graduates top of the class, goes through college and gets a high paying job right out of the gate. The one without the computer needs to go to the library. After spending an hour walking there, he learns that all the books on thet person are checkedout. He finds a book with a short bit on that person and writes about thet. He fails the test, fails the grade, drops out of school, and works ot a @ORGANIZATION1 his entire life. See how much of a different a computer can make? My second reason is that, even though computers are often thought of as destroying @CAPS2, @CAPS3 can build social lives. Millions of people use the internet everytime and there are places on the web built so that they can talk. Some people @MONTH1 that this is and leads to , but anyone who has basic knowledge knows not to information. The internet also has and those still unsure can use specially sites to talk to people they know in life onlt. @CAPS2 also allows for people to ask questions. Having differently finding specific information? Just post a question on a public site use people with first hand experience will answer @CAPS2 with all the detail you need and more. Say that somebody wants to be a writter, but needs to know how the writing system works, how to set a job in @CAPS2, what the pay is, etc. He searches the internet, but only finds job applications and college ady so he asks the questions on a public site. Someone who has been a write their whole lives checks out the question, and answers @CAPS2 ion great detail. Problem solvely and @CAPS2 someone on the internet. My final reason is the entertainment computer provide you can play games, watch movies or homemade videos, and even talk to friends. Computers allow you to access thousands of free services to benefit you. Sitting in your room, bored? Why not play a game on your computer. Tired of @CAPS4.V movies? Go to the computer and have an infinite wideo library? Go to the computer and have an infinite video library at your dipasle. Lonely? Go to a social website and strike up a conversation. @CAPS2 has infinite entertainment, right at your finger-tips. In conclusion, I believe that compkuters is no limit to what you can do with a computer, as long as you have the imagination. Computers were invented to benefit mankind, not hurting and they are doing a great job."	5	5		10																					
1676	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 glad to see that you have a debate if computers are good or bad for human society. Well I would like to state my opinion if that is good with you. In my letter @CAPS2 going to tell the bad stuff about computer and why there not good for society. Well I dont think computer are good for society because you dont work-out as much as you use to. I can say that a fact because I use to work-out then a computer games came out and I spent @NUM1 hours a day playing it I had no time to spend with my family, I had no outside commaction it was like it topic over my life. Plus I know a lot people who feel the same way. The computer is like a addiction. I say this because once you hit the power button you cant get off. All the commution website are hard to get off because there starting to put games on so you wont log off as fast. THe have different website that play video of things that are funny. Like once you find it you click and a of things so when you look you on same thing else. Dont get me wrong you can see and talk to family members you dont see but you dont have ime to go to the park and have fun and enjoy nature it like you looked up. I dont think we should get rede of computers but we should spend least tine as we do know. I know people are going to be upset by waht I say but we as a society are addicted to the computer. Every were you look theres a computer. I going to leave on one not would you pick computers or life? "	4	4		8																					
1677	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The use of advanced computers have increased. You don't see kids outside as often. On the news, you hear about obesity. And you hear the crime rates go up. This does not benefit the socierty. Computers has a negative effect on people. Does your neighborhood seem to be locking children? It's not because their dead! They are now always inside on their computer. I know a thirteen year old named @ORGANIZATION1. She even admits that being on a computer is better than being outside with friends. Meeting people over technology, especially for miners, is a huge risk. You don't know the person. Soon, you would have no friends when it comes to being in the social life. You'd be the outsider. For @PERSON3, her family doesn't even know who she is anymore. Do you want your child to be the outsider? Being on a computer all the time is like being at a fastfood restaurant. You don't exercise, all you do is eat andt talk, but now all you do is eat and on the computer. I have met a obese child. @PERSON2. He weighs three-hundred pounds at the age fourteen. An eight grader, can you believe that? He tells me he has his laptop on his lap, surrounder by junk food. He never exercises or take a break. His report card is unbelievable. He used to be A @CAPS3 student. Now he's in a dump. @PERSON2 does not listen to his mom at all. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION2's, mom says ""he locks himself in his room, goes straight to his laptop, and starts eating. You can even hear him munching the junkfood."" And we wonder why our kids are getting obese there days. It used to be about jobs, but now it's about who you meet on a computer. Myspace, facebook, twitter, you name it, is how the crime rates are increasing now. The people behind these pictures and profiles @MONTH1 not be who you think they are. Especially, miners who lie about their age. They're the ones who fall for those perverted old men. That is one way our sex offenders get a way around. They can use someone's name and be underover. They tell these young girls to meet them places and that's how our young girls, and boys, gets kidnapped, rapped, and end-up killed. A computer holds millions of ways criminals can commit a crime. Do you want your child to be next? Computers these days, are used in the wrong ways, by the wrong people. Kids are never outside again. They are getting obese. And it's a way they get kidnapped. Don't allow this. Get your child(ren) away from their laptops now! Go on a family vacation, somewhere fun. And don't let these sick-minded people get to you or your kids. Take action now!"	5	5		10																					
1690	1	"My opinion on the effects of computers is that most people in the world spend most of their time sitting on the computer day in and day out. If someone I knew spent all day long on the computer I would tell him or her head on that he or she sould go out side and get some fresh air and get some exrcise. Some times the only way to make contact with them is by talking to them on the computer. Although the computer can be quit helpful by looking up important artifacts or important information about medical plans, tutorials of how to fix, make, or biuld things, and to meet new people, But, the computer can be a dangerous place as well you can meet someone who is lieing about their age that person might rape or miurder/kill you. If you spend twenty-four seven on the computer you could be paralized from lack of exercise or get lumf ophemia thats when your body a pears and will not be a to exercise and would need special treatments. Like masogise. Computers can also be good because it can give you hand eye coordination by useing the still looking sometimes some people for useing the computer: videos, video, and websites. You can get your computer uloaded for for quality. Some systems howe computers in them or can be connected to the computer like the, and the @CAPS1 @NUM1 @CAPS2. There are games called p.c. games some p.c. games comeucicate with childern to teach them how to write, read, spell, and pronounce words. There are also spiecal computers and/or web-sites you can search for tutorial for speaking different langueges. There are also sites you can search for tutorials for playing instroments. Some people use the computer to fill their emptynis inside of them inistead of eating. Some people obeuse the compeuter as a dug like they're addictied to it. Imagine someone addictied to computers every where he/she goes they would take their laptop with them. Many people have died useing the computer but thats because they obeused it. Everyday people buy computers this invention is very helpful as time goes on sciantists are makeing new things to save llives."	4	5		9																					
1696	1	"Wouldn't you agree that computers are needed in our life. I would, we need computer for many things, for example we need computer for communications, we also need them to educate yourself and others. Next this is good for buyers and sellers. My first reason why I agree that computers benifits society is because of the communications. Now in our present day with all of our new technology many people use computers to communicate with friends or family. For example if you had a loved one in the military you could use the computer to communicate with him with a webcam. Computer could be a good way to talk and ask friends about homework assignments you @MONTH1 have missed as if you was absent. Also you could use computers to communicate with somebody selling something you @MONTH1 be or, you could get more detail about that product by talking to the owner of it through maybe email. My second reason would be education. Now a days many college students with work going on @MONTH1 not have time to attend schools so with the help of a computer they can take online classes. For some students instead of study in classroom all day they could be learning from computers and it could be more to the students so maybe they would understand topics better. like science for example when doing a lab you could research and do it on a computer. With computers students could learn more because they would have textbooks or maybe nothing and if they were interested in a topic they could research it and educate themselves. My third reason would be buying and selling products. Many people all over the world go on the internet to buy or sell products. Like ebay that is a website many people items on to make money and other people can buy them. So computers could be a good solution to making money and to also saving gas because people can order products online and have them shipped to there house instead of driving @CAPS1 from the I have told you like communications, education, and buying and selling products I hope you agree with me that computers do benifit society"	4	5		9																					
1699	1	"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on peoples' lives. You can do alot of stuff on the internet that costs too much to do without it. You can study different foods and cultures around the world. If you play games online you can get better hand-eye coordination skills. There are also things you can buy to video chat with family or friends. The computer is very convinient and useful. If you are interested in a place in the world you can type in the name of the place and get facts about cultures, foods, and more. Instead of buying an airline ticket to see @LOCATION1, you can go online to learn @CAPS1 language. You can also study food s that people eat and the clothes they wear. You can also learn sports and games. If you play games on the computer you can get a better hand-eye coordination. Most games you can daunloads and are free. There are puzzle games that challenge you, action that are fun and take rapid button pressing, and adventure that let you explore new lands. And in alot of these games you can talk to people and make friends. There are otherways to talk instead of games. There is email, chat rooms, facebook, twitter, and video chat. With any of these things you can talks to friends or family around the world or in your state/country. All of these you can either download, go on the internet for, or buy them. You can talk to old friends or you can talk to family you havent seen in a while. Video chat you can see eacho ther, face book you can share pictures and chat rooms you can talk with multiple people. In conclusion computers are very convinient for our society today. Whether it's studying the world, having fun, or talking to people you know, the computer has many wonderous things for people"	4	4		8																					
1701	1	"The computer is able to do so many things. It think computers have posotive effects on people. But some experts believe they don’t which is why I'm writing this paper so that I can explain the positions from both sides. Did you know most everyone who his a house their chances of having a computer is just as lucky as having a telephone. Computers believe it they help us in life wether @CAPS1 to keep information, talk online, find a good recipe or what ever it is @CAPS1 there. That is why computers are so positive. It we did not have computers there would not be any technological advances that we have @DATE1, @CAPS1 one of the most important devices. Let me share my expierence okay. I had a job interview right well I could not find that street so I went on my computer and it gave me the directions I made it to my interview. Thats why I think computers have posotive effects. Now the opposite side says people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with fiends and family. Well I have some people spend to much time on their computer @CAPS1 completely choice. And those are people who usually don't have alot of self control. And exercising who said that everyone need exercise in the persons already skinny what does need to exercise. For the interacting with friends and family you can do that I mean how long can a person look at a computer screen. So in conclusion you can see that computers are good but with self control they can be enjoyed with no bad side effects. So next time on the computer enjoy it but remember your friends, family and your health is more important."	4	4		8																					
1705	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, walking into a room seeing people interacting with their computer screen I earning new and exciting, information they can everyday. The question is what effects do computers have on people? I certainly think computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and peapre, and even allow people to talk online with others. Computers can definetly have a positive on soriety. Computers have tought a very valueable to every user; hand-eye coordination! Whetver it's clicking a link to a site that you found on @ORGANIZATION2, or playing the matching same of bejeweled, you are learing hand-eye coordination. A cording to recent studies, over @PERCENT1 of people interviewed said they had excellent hand-eye coordination and @PERCENT2 said it was on the computer. Sure we all need to get exercise outside, but the computer can be helpful as long as we don't let it overwelm us. Smart people would agree that coordination is a very helpful skill. These brilliant inventions also helps us learn a bout different places and people. Picture this scenario if you will; A student at @ORGANIZATION1 has to do a project on the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the @LOCATION1. He goes to the library to check out the encyclopedias but... they are out of date. He then goes to the computer lab and finds it on @ORGANIZATION2 like that! This scenario shows that the computer is one of the fastect ways to get information on any subject or topic. Certainly text sources can give the same accurate information, but the computer is fast and easy. When you need information on the line. But why stop there? not only can you get information on certain people and places on these machines, you can also learn what's the newest fads, what's carrently happening in @LOCATION2, and the latest @CAPS6 gossip. The computer is definetly a easy sources for information on different areas and people. This amazing device can also let you talk to people online! There are many ways to do this. You can use the old-fashioned @CAPS7-mail, you can use a device in the @CAPS8 called someone. You of course need a @CAPS9 to do thank one. I remenber a time when I was bored so I decided to do my homework. The problem was I forgot what it was! I quickly grabbed the phone and called my class mate but he didn't answer. I then sprinted to my computer and to see if he was online. Sure enough he was! I got the home work and got an A all thanks to the computers ability to interact with others."	6	6		12																					
1707	1	"Dear whom it @CAPS1, Have you ever wondered what it be like to spend all your time in front of computers? Well, if you are, I believe that should not be in front of that computer all day. As my mom says only an hour aa day is good. One reason why it is important is because you need to enjoy what life has to offer. You could do stuff like play catch with the dogs walk the dog, and (or) play over a friends house. Yes, playing on computer is fun, but you have to execise to. (you know) @CAPS2 reason why is because you can end up somewhere where you did not even need to go to. You could also make lots of new friends by going out doors. Like that's how I met trees, animals, beautiful senery. You could feel like you were having the time or your. The last and final reason why this is you can get a lot out that you could use. you could make snowmen in the winter or if it's raining you could watch a movie. you could build a lot. In conclusion building, playing and jumping (the list could go on) You can enjoy the outdoors. Just rember the three good reason why are you could use the wonderful and lovly outdoors. Go walk you dog, have friends ober or even just having out with your family and friends."	4	3		7

If we don’t use computers why we even have computers? Computers can help you to learn faraway places like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, @PERSON1, and other faraway places. If we don't know what is going on faraway places then we don't know what kind flag they have and what do they eat, what do they have, are what they do, and what do they speak. You can even talking online with your friends on computer! You dont have to call you friend, you can just talk to you frien on online, if you need help with your homework are you left your math text book at school you frient can tell you the questions by talking online. If your friend is in @LOCATION2 are other faraway places your friend can bring there computer with him or her so your friend can just talking to you by talking online, you dont have to call your friend in @LOCATION2 or other places. You can also learn how to type, when you know how to type you can type faster and faster. You can type storys, poem, and notes are something you have to do at school, so you don't have to write on a pace of peaper you can just type on computer. That is why we should have computers and use more. I hope you agree with me."	3	3		6																					
1720	1	"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 in your newspaper, I read an article that sparked my interest. The article was about the negative effects computers have on the community. I couldn't help but disagree with the article, @PERSON1 because, in my opinion, computers are a step in the right direction for modern technology. I believe computers are a benefit to society because they premote hand-eye coordination, you can learn about almost anything, and you can talk online to other people. How do computers help with hand-eye coordination, you ask? When you are typing on the computer your eyes are on the screen while your hands are typing and strengthening at an incredible rate! A study made by students at @ORGANIZATION1 shows that the chances of developing arthritis by the time you are @NUM1 dropped almost @PERCENT1 in people that use computers often. Also, the hand-eye coordination you get from typing, goes a long way in sports such as tennis and baseball. So if someone needs to build up their hand eye coordination I suggest that they take a computer class, like the ones that are offered in many schools all over the country. Secondly, using the internet on computers makes finding information on a variety of subjects much easier. Say you wanted to go on vacation with your family. Instead of calling a number, why not go online and plan your entire trip from your computer. There are so many websites that make it fast and easy. In addition, sites can teaching people how to clothings are always nearby. If you wanted to learn how to knit, just type in ""how to knit"" in your favorite search engine and there are over @NUM2 sites to help you, making it easy to learn to make a great or fix a bike. In addition to learning about new things the internet allows you to friends. After camp, I would always say ""oh we will keep in touch,"" but I never would be able to keep any promise. Once I found an instant messager or webcam application on the internet, it was very easy to talk to my friends. Every once in a while I talk to my friend who now lives in @LOCATION1! Also, my dad is always stressed about meetings with other countries, but now that he can use webcams to talk to his other international bosses, he is so excited about his meetings. He always says that the computers nowadays are very easy to use for talking to people. In conclusion, I believe that computers are a benefit to the world because they help with hand-eye coordination, make it easy to get information, and talk to people."	5	6		11

Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of familys dont talk because they are to preocupied with computar games. The issue to grapple with is @CAPS1 computars have an affect on people. Yes, I think that computars have a negitive affect on people based on the following reasons. People spent to much time on the computar and dont get enought exersize, they dont enjoy the nature that we have, and they dont inter act with there family and friends. People spent to much time on the computar and dont get enough exersize. Statistics show that @PERCENT3 of people that are over weight spend more time on the computar than on the track. I remember a time when I was over weight be cause I spent to much time on the computar. One day my mom took the computar ant threw it out the window and I had no chioce but to go outside and get some exersize. @CAPS1 you want kids to be over weight like I was? Many people dont get to enjoy the great out doors because they are to preocupied with the computar. Lisa, a volentere worker in @LOCATION1, says "This feild used to be a vast array of plants and animal life, but now it is a waste land because of computars. No one had the time to worry of the natural wonder because they were to @CAPS2 with there computar animated jobs and didnt care what came of it. @CAPS1 you want this to happen to our country? @PERCENT4 of high technological places are dirty with very little plant life because the workers need to tend to the computars rather than the bushes. Some familys have a hard time talking about their dayly lifes becuse they spendin to much time on the computar and dont spend the time to talk and get to know each other. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 ofdevorces are related to not being able to have aconversation and with more technoligy on the way that number will grow. I remember that my parents got devorced because my dad spent more time on the computar than talking to me or my mom. Most people think that computars are good for research. Yes, but you are still cooped up in the house insted of in a big library with all the information you need. I think that computars have a negitive impact on people."	5	5		10																					
1737	1	"I agree with the computers helping people. To start with, computers have a possitive affect on us. They also give us the ability to learn. Also it allows people to talk online from far away places. So, yes, computers are good for people. First of all, computers do have a possitive affect. The computer @MONTH1 give some one motivation. Or it will help someone find their lost pet. Also it could help you get a job. Plus you can find a safe home with it. So, ya computers do have a possitive effect. You can also gain the ability to learn. This is by helping deth people with sites on sighn language. Also you can get information on places you will visit. This will help learn about diffrent contrays. Most importantly it will help kids an adults on school work or work. This concluds that you can learn things on the computers. The computer also allows you to talk with people far away. This will come in handy for familys. Also people who have hospitilized family. Plus fathers or moms in the military can talk with their kids. Most of all though is adopted kids could talk to their birth parents online. Here is another reason why computers are good. This is why I agree with computers. They have a possitive affect on people. They given us ability to learn! Lastly it allows you to talk to people you love that are far away. So, in conclution, it is a benifit for people to use the computers!"	4	4		8																					
1739	1	"Dear State legistator, @CAPS1 you live back a long time ago when there were no computers. The only diffrence now is the technology is there but you are not allowed to use it. Do you think your job would be harder. I deffidently think that computers are making your job and everyone elses lifes easier. With the computer it teaches hand-eye cordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it gives people the ability to talk to each other. I belive the @CAPS4 technology of the computer is defidently helping out society. To start, computers are helping many people with their hand eye coordination. As you know hand eye coordination is necsicarry for a good driver. The @CAPS4 statistics that came out from “@CAPS2 drivers.com” the rate of accidents has decreased over the past ten years. In fact it decraced over @PERCENT1. With all the computer games that they have for young kids it is improving kids hand eye coordination. Starting at a young age. With the games like “@CAPS3” a majority of kids are ridding bikes skiing or snow boarding by five years old. All of these activities require very good hand eye coordination. Lastly , the resources that help with hand eye coordination are being used to help special-ed students get better at simple tasks at a faster pase. Secondly the world wide web is teaching people of all ages about places that are located thousands of miles away from their homes. Something that I personaly use my computer for is to research a location and find history on it before I go on vacation to that place. The computers in our school has helped our classes in social studies. My teacher @PERSON1 said that he has been grading more strictly often and the grades are still up by @PERCENT2 on computer and internet research projects. I should also add in that using the computers our school is in communication with a school in @LOCATION1. Once a week we email our pen-pa. the computers have deffidently helped my schools curriculum. Finally, computers are letting people of all ages talk to buisness partners, friends etc. The social networking sites have kept @PERCENT3 of friends in touch found in “@CAPS4-tech” magazine. I should also add in it has reconected @PERCENT4 of friends from high school all due to the computer. Another form of online talking is vidio chatting which many people are now using for buissness meetings instead of spending the money to fly to the location of their meeting. Now, for one day you should track how many hours you are on the computer for your job. I can bet the number is going to be about @PERCENT5 of the time you are in you office. The computers have with hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about places far away from home, and lets people talk to each other online. So do me a favor state legislator relize and come to terms how much society needs the computer."	4	6		10

The computer is the smartest thing youll ever see. All the facts of life and the world are put into it. Think of all the knowledge you would have from reading articles you find on google.com and all the other search engines. Wondering what is the best way to get somewhere? You can also look at maps of the whole world and zoom all the way to birds eye view. There's your map with just a click of the cursor. Does your child have a question from school that even you can't answer? There are help sites that can show and explain how to do your homework. Or if your child doesn't know what the homework and their friends are busy and can't tell them, most schools have websites with information about everything in school. There's your child's grades with just a click of the cursor. Your late for a party and you don't have a cell phone, but your family has one computer and you know your friend will be on. You can just log on to your facebook, twitter, or myspace and tell them your running late. It's @DATE1, no one writes letters anymore; there's e-mail and instant messaging. Letters take forever to write and if you mess up you have to start over. When you type, all you do is hit ""backspace"" and you write over only your mistake. Letters also take forever to recieve, while instant messeges come, well, instantly! Haven't seen your cousin or just want to see them? Computers are being made with webcams, or you can simply buy a detached one. You could be talking with your friend and seeing them right on your computer just with a click of the cursor. Don't think that's enough? If you explored the computer, then you'd find it can help you with a lot more than just learning and interaction."	5	5		10

The children also put their self in danger by joining a few different websites. Don’t waste your time in a boring computer screen! I am almost @PERCENT1 positive that the students who are doing poorly in school, are the students who go home, throw their back packs in the hallway, and start playing silly games online. My mom use to go on and on about how my dad spents to much time on @CAPS1, when he would only go one @NUM1 minutes a day to talk to family members. Now, my mom created a @CAPS1, that @CAPS2 said @CAPS2 was gona only go on to with the family, but @CAPS2 plays all the pointless applications, such as, ""cafe world."" @CAPS2 waste her time on @CAPS1 whenever @CAPS2 is home, when @CAPS2 could be going out and spending quality time with the family or out with friends. Something I havent mentioned is, I use to be one of those students who come home, throw their stuff in the hallways, and turn on the computer, the only difference is I didnt go online to play games, I would go on to talk to my friends I just saw! I relized after I got my report card that my gades were horifyingly terrible. My dad then disconected my @CAPS4, and I beleive my grades have gone up. At first I hated my dad for disconecting the @CAPS4, but now I want to thank him for breaking a disapointing hoby of being online whenever @CAPS3 home. He also mentioned to my sister how much exersize @CAPS2 was loosing all because @CAPS2 wanted to play online. In alot of ways, computers are pointless! Do you know how dangerous some websites can be? I once watched a television show at my aunts house, and an old creepy guy started a website were the teens had to video tape themselfs choking themselfs and who ever did it the longest won. About a hundred students died from playing the deadly game. There's also a website, ""blogtv.com."" were teens go online and go live on a webcam were anyone can watch them. I remember their was a week when my cousin, denise, and her best friend wanted to see who can get more veiwers. The two girls did unaproprient things on the webshows such as, flashing, dirty dancing, and showing body parts. The two girls were then banned from the website, but this was after people had screen shoted them and posted pictures of the girls. This should not be allowd for anyone to do, it's disterbing! Stop wasting your life people! Go out and have fun, dont let the @CAPS4 keep you home. The @CAPS4 is unsafe and pointless."	4	5		9

Take away your computer and all youre doing is sitting thhere, not burning one calorie, or exercising one muscle, [expect your fingers of ] @CAPS2't you think you should be doing something more usefull in your life?

1759	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a negative affect on peoples lives. Computers occupy a lot of people's time which could be used for other matters. The internet also contains alot of unappropriate content that children should not be viewing. But above all, there are too many petafiles online preying on young children. These are all ways that computers have a negative affect on peoples lives. Computers occupy so much valuable time that could be used for other, more important matters. The childhood obesity rate in america is climbing. There is no doubt that electronics, play a huge role in this event. For example my brother plays on the computer everyday, so barely goes outside. He has allowed the computer and the internet to occupy his life, leaving no room for anything else. Also there is alot of content. Ranging from a song to websites containing pornagraphy. most sites don't even alert you that by how you need to be @NUM1 or older to view the content, and very little acctually ask for proof. There are millions of sites containing such content. It really is a pressing matter and needs to be deal with. Above all else, there are millions of creeps on the internet, preying on children as a young teens. Its truly disgusting. There are millions of chat sites in which people can meet and. Petafiles go on these websites under an alias, pretending to be teens and children. Their motive, to lure young teens unto meeting them in a secure location, and to commit rape. Some victims are enough speak up but sadly, most are too afraid or ashamed to do so this is all made possible through the internet. For these reasons I say that computers have a negative effect computers lives because some positive but sadly cons outweight pros such as before mention occupation of time, content on the internet. I truly believe that the planet would be better with out computers."	5	5		10

1770	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, experts have been concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers, which is harmful to their health. They are wrong. Computers help people communicate, learn, and even provide entertainment. For these reasons, computers are good. Computers help people communicate with their family and friends, Some people @MONTH1 think that phones are better than computers for communication purposes, but computers are more long distance, and you will never get a busy signal. Some phone services are very expensive, and cost even more money for long distance calling. With a computer, though, you can send emails all around the globe... at no extra cost. Also, with a computer, you never get put on hold or hear a busy signal. You simply send your message, then do whatever you want while you wait for a reply. Computers help educate people, too. Many people take classes, especially college level classes, online. In fact, about half of the people taking college classes right now... aren't even in a school! This can help many people who are working most of the day, because they can get their degree in their. Also, computers can help people with the little things such as, ""where's the nearest @ORGANIZATION1"" or ""how much does something cost."" Computers can ever help people plan a vacation, or learn about a country on the other side of the earth. Computers can also provide entertainment for people. People who need something to cheer them up can watch a funny video with the click of a button. Someone who is feeling bored could play one of countless games that have been created, and range from pointless to addicting, from tiny to massive. For all those @CAPS4 lovers out there, the computer is an alternative. An alternative where songs don't cost money, and neither do music videos. Of course, computers don't fit in your pocket, but there's always a laptop. Based on what you just read, it should be easy to see that computers improve people's lives because they provide education, communication and entertainment."	5	5		10

Computers are helpful in many ways, they can be an information post. The social networks can help your kids get more interactive with the world. During school kids have projects and without computers. Read on as I will explain in details. Computers, as you know, are one of the worlds greatest information posts. @NUM1 out of ten people survayed said that the computers are a value of everyday life, The earthquake in haiti is recovalng now, but half the world wouldnt know that with out computers so have a heart, and dont take away the most valued info in the world. Secondly, what would you say if I told, you that kids are more socialy retarded than ever! Well its true. Over @NUM2 of the worlds people rely on intractive websites to comunicate with each other. Fact, children have more friends over the internet then ever. You dont want to be the @LOCATION1 in all this do yours ar know as the person who kept kids from living? I dont think so. Lastly, all people in school use computers to do projects, for instance @PERSON2 had horrible hand writing and this was the bigest project of the year.

1773	1	"Dear @CAPS1 newspaper, I have resently read that ther are some people do not agree with computers. They belive that people use them all the time. I dissagre with them. One of my examples of why I disagree is because they give a person the ability to talk to someone. This is a great idea! What if your friend moved a few states over wouldn't you still want to communicate? Well, with high long-distance rates, many cna't afford this and how would you see your friend anymore? Well, if you send her pics, or video chat over the web, you can! Also, its a great idea if you want to send a small mesage like ""see you at @NUM1"", instead of saying it on the phone, and paying more, when its free on the computer. The computer also teachs hand-eye coordiantion that is important to use in the world. You can play games, take quiza and tests, go to school on the internet, even listin to music, that is important for us to express. Also there are sites that allow you to learn how to use a keyboard, and work electronics like a computer! And lastly, the computer gives you the ability to see far away places without even beiong there. This helps you do a project on a place you have never been, plan a family reunion or vacation, or find a place where you can have that fun in the shining sun, many people think that too many people are staying in front of their computer than exercising and being outside. To prevent that, they should just limit themselfs to the amount of computer and electronic time they have per day and then go exercise go to a faraway place. So, the computer teachs hand-eye coordiantion, allows you to talk to others,and allows you to see far away places. Don't you think that is great? Think about it. "	4	4		8

People are in this type @ORGANIZATION1 situation all the time at @ORGANIZATION2 a survey was taken by all the students to see what they wanted their career to be, @CAPS2 the rest @ORGANIZATION1 the week students got to experience diffrent carrer options. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 the students picked a different carrer after that one week. Have you ever heard the old aget ""@CAPS3 is power""? well its true and computers are a great source @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3. they have many different subjects math, science, history language and much much more. people should be using this @CAPS3 at the @CAPS4 francisco national debate @PERSON2. Said that ""@CAPS5 are a great tool when used properly this includes looking up new places math. and even comunicating these are what computers should be used @CAPS2 not unhealthy games. You can learn about many new places with a @CAPS5. In @NUM1 grade my teacher had everyone do areport on a country me and my friend found this place we had both never heard @ORGANIZATION1. with the @CAPS5 we found onts @ORGANIZATION1 information on it such us its main income, exports, resorts, and fun activities. After reading all the facts surely one would agree that a @CAPS5 is a great tool that should be used. It lots people communicate, helps in educational decisions, and you can learn many subjects such as math, science, and language. I strongly believe that all people should use a @CAPS5."	5	4		9																					
5978	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The features of the setting that affect the cyclist is the lact of information on were to go and the lack of water. This was a problem because he needed water for his trip and directions on were to go.  	1	1		1																					
5981	3	"I believe the features of the cyclist affected him because he was impatient and trustworthy he tock the old mens advice to take an hr of his time bay taking a short cat, if he would of stayed true to the mep he wouldn’t of almost ared of heat but his impatientress got the best of him so he took the shortcut. After his experence he new haes to stat ?? to the mep and not trust people who havent seen changes in the last few years.  "	1	1		1																					
5986	3	"The essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” describes a man’s bicycle ride through California. Now, California is very hot during the summer, which is when the cyclist is riding. This setting greatly affects the man’s journey. It made it very difficult for him to finish his ride. He drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride so he gets very dehydrated. The text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” As you can see the setting makes this man’s bikeride very hard."	2	2		2																					
5997	3	"Some features of the setting affect the cyclist. First the cyclist followed the old codgers advice of how to get to Yosemite National Park. Their advice was no use and didnt help her in the end. Next, “a tarlike substance oozed out” of what she thoot was going to be water. Then the terrain changed to “short, rolling hills”, which wasnt helping, her bike better. Lastly, ""tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake”, slowed her down. All of these road blocks in the setting affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6000	3	"“Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” had a  rough setting between harzardous things and the death defying heat. The cyclist had to endure the pain of dehydration and determination. He had been given bad directions that almost caused him his life. He was travelling through a desert and claimed the temperature was @NUM1.Also, the cyclist had to ration his water because it was ghost towns in which our character passed through. He used nature skills he’d once learned and began to suck on pebbles which take the mind off thirst and uses saliva to help refresh your throat. Throughout his adventure everything kept this young man from getting water and to whenever there was water any faster. He had survived and wouldn’t ever take shortcuts again"	2	2		2																					
6008	3	"The features of this setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting is a dessert so by common knowledge you know that it is going to be hot and dry. Because it is hot the cyclist needs more water because he is getting dehydrated. And when he is on his low of water because it is dry into mouth gets drys. @CAPS2 because he is in the dessert he sees wild sometime dangerous animals, in the story he sees a ridiculously @CAPS1 diamondbrock snake, which I believe are venomous, @CAPS2 ‘because ‘ of the extreme heat of the dessert he realizes that he had ??? chance of dropping from heatstroke. @CAPS2 the writer said that the dessert had short rolling hills and rough road ahead ??? would leave worn the cyclist out. Because of this terrain the cyclist way affects."	1	1		1																					
6016	3	"The narrator in this story goes through a tough journey insisting of hope, challenge physical pain, despair, and relief. All of these are further developed by the settings where they take place, For example after taking advice from old men at a campsite, he is on his way through the deserts of California. If he had been almost anywhere else, his journey could have been much better. He could have gotten more reliable advice, or had been in a place where the towns were not miles and miles apart. Also, at one point he reaches a snake on the road. This could symbolize a decision, which was to go and how it will affect the outcome of his trip, or perhaps the decisions he had already made. To take advice from strangers and better yet he should use it. The irony continues as he becomes dehydrated and the flat land turns hilly. If that weren’t to happen he could have been more successful and healthy on his trip. The setting in this men’s story are necessary for if to have plot line and have the humour it possesses. If he were in the city, for example, he would not get lost and stranded, and therefore would have no story."	3	2		3																					
6018	3	The features of the settings affect in the story “Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit” it is the morning and everyone is still sleep and he wakes in the morning for something to do when he pull up to the first plase he thinks that they are all old and crazy and he thinking that the places needs fixing because the houses are falling apart. Then..leaves and see these wide bunch of hills. inconclusion I would never do all the riding he did.  	1	2		2																					
6019	3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the desert with no water and doesnt know where he is going. The old men on the porch gave him wrong directions now he is lost in the desert. The cyclist find the will power to keep on moving and he finds help along the way. He finds another old man there that offer him directions but he says he has a map	1	1		1																					
6026	3	"In the story many different settings affected the author in many different ways. In the very beginning of his journey he came across a ghost town. He reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope. “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" He still has hope that he would end up safe and in the right place. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the rode. He grew worried when he saw that no near town was still in sight. “This sight was troubling” when the features of the next setting caught his eye he was desperate and devastated. “At some point, tumble weed crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water, when he reached the abandoned @CAPS1’s factory all his hope was lost and when he was planning his death. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" @CAPS2, when he reached the fish camp, he was relieved ""I had overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, Kiss them and buy some bait.” He was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived.    "	3	3		3																					
6027	3	"Ghost towns are not exactly the most inviting place for a cyclis trunning low on water supply. In “Rough road ahead: do not exceed speed limit” the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright start off as a good thing, while his mood is still fresh and happy expressions play on his face. But as he moves on he speaks of how “The sun was beginning to beat down” expressing his remorse of listening to the old men that led him on their “shortcut.” Along the road he comes to his first let-down, a ghost town with “one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest male.” @CAPS1 he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a “battery-acid” flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink. This affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament. By the end he is relieved though when he comes to GARY & @CAPS2 FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he “had an overwhelming urge to seek out @ORGANIZATION1, kiss them and buy some bait.” His thankfulness is expressed to men he doesn’t even know but because they were the light at the end of his long, dark and very exhausting tunnel."	3	3		3																					
6028	3	"The features of setting affect the cyclist. It was hard arrived at the first town for author. For example “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The road that author was ridding, it was rough. @CAPS1 example is “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” All the road was hills and rough. Than “The water bottle contained only a few tontalizing sips.” @CAPS1 doesn’t have that much water. That was really hard."	2	1		2																					
6030	3	"The setting puts a great deal of stress on the cyclist. The biggest issue he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist “traveling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1 in June.” He had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water. Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank “water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure."	3	2		3																					
6032	3	"The setting affected the cyclist a lot. One way was the heat. It got so hot that he was becoming dehydrated. He kept drinking his water, until he didnt have any left. Another reason is because the road turned into hills which made him use more energy. Finally, it didn't help that he hadnt seen any sign of living creatures except for a snake @CAPS1 how the setting affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6037	3	"Heat, dry, flat - all are features of the setting that effected the cyclist. As the cyclist was driving through the desert, he noticed how hot it was, and how he would become dehydrated quickley. I was also very dry and and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was. The flat ground models how there is nothing around that can help the cyclist, which made him scared. The story also metions that he is a ghost town"	2	2		2																					
6039	3	"In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie there were many things that effected the cyclist. Such as the water. He had no really good water to drink because of where he was''. When I tryed a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid''. He wasnt able to drink the water because the battery acid'' that was in it could have made him very sick. Also the unstable roads that he had to bike through made things hard. ''Rough roads ahead'' To ride on unstable ground can be very hard to do. So just these two examples, the water and Rough roads made the features of the setting deffinitly effect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6044	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the rode conditions. The rode was all messed up. 	1	2		2																					
6054	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The setting affects the cyclist because the weather is very hot and humid which makes him sweat which is using up energy because his body is trying to stay cool. Also the setting affects the cyclist because there is no water so on top of sweating being out of energy he has no water to refuel his body which makes it very hard for him to keep going.	1	1		1																					
6059	3	"The setting greatly affects the cyclist because he is the one riding over, “short rolling hills,” and arround a,“ridiculously large snake,” and because its hot he could suffer from heatstroke at any minut. So yes the author is affected by the setting"	1	1		1																					
6060	3	The affects of the features around them affect them by the hot bikes so the bikers need water and also it affects them by the roads are so hill so they can’t just road. Stight so they need to go over the hilles and that affects them because cycles are very hard to land form a jump.	1	1		1																					
6061	3	"The features of the setting in Yosemite give the cyclist something in look forward to, but the feature of the sorting that he is in enduse in get there causes him despaire. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and notices swettering hed of the sun during early endeavers of the trip he checks himself up as he says,""I brely noticed it [the sun], the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Although the cyclist began to feel the toll that the trip and the sun was going to take on him, he erased the morning with the hope and bealy of arriving at Yosemite. The more the cyclist noticedthe sun the more he drank untill his water supply seemed low, striping as an old rusty water pump he had hope of being replenished but the taste of bitter battery acid caused the cyclist to stop drinking. The rolling hills, Sun and tumbleweds did nothing to quech the cyclist thirst or at least divert his assertion. If the cyclists was to see a sign that said Yosemite @NUM1 miles away his spirits would have risen, instead he saw a sign that said, ”Rough Road Ahead” which did nothing to help him. If the terrain was more poporsed, easier to travel on and in plenty supply of water, the tune of this passive would be more hoped instead in such despair, the features of the setting caused the cyclist grief instead of hope."	3	3		3																					
6070	3	"The setting and features affect the cyclist because with each building he hopes for water, but since he is traveling through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the wastland. These buildings create a feeling of releve in the cyclist anty to be followed by despair to find them abandoned. The land with no features also creates a feeling of lost hope in the rider making his entire ordeal that much harder. Over all it was an excureiatly experience physicly and mentaly for the cyclists."	2	2		2																					
6073	3	"The cyclist was so set on seeing cool, piney trees and lakes, that when he saw dirt, snake, and no source of civilization worried him. More affectively, what he didn’t see scared him most. He did see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees. He didn’t see any people or friendly little forest critters. Instead he just saw the same rusty color of dirt and the occasional snake. His mood was affected and he started to lose confidence and hope. He wasn't used to the new surroundings and for a while doubted if he could even make it out alive. When he came across the run-down building of Welch’s factory, he was even more distraught. Fortunately, he did find civilization when he came to a fishing supply shop. This definetly boosted his spirits. Once he had saved his thirst problem and assured himself he has alive and would luckily stay that way, he sat down before wading out again in search of his destination."	2	1		2																					
6077	3	"The settings affect the cyclists for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isn’t very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6080	3	"The features of the setting made the cyclist’s ride longer and harder than he expected. When the cyclist first headed out the road was flat and smooth. Halfway through his trip the “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The cyclist continues to pedel even though he was slowed down to 12 mph. The hills made the ride slower and harder because of the hills. Tuoards the end of the hills he had to make it “Over on long, crippling hill”. The word “crippling“ is used to show the phisical affect that the hill had on him. The hills were a feature of the setting which made the cyclist’s ride longer, harder, and more phisically demanding."	1	2		2																					
6081	3	There are numerous features in the setting that effect the cycleist. For example  the rough road. A nother example is the tumble weed and the snake also affected the cyclist. In conclusion those are the reasons the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
6083	3	The setting is like a desert with no water or people civilizations anywhere around him. This make him more worried because if he dies know one will know for days or weeks probably.	1	1		1																					
6086	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is hard to go far on a bike when the place, you are ridding is dry, abandoned, a quiet, hot cold and straight forward. It tells you that the setting is abandoned when if says “there was none in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind"". This would make it hard for a cycler because you need a good water supply and thats hard to keep when there is nothing around."	1	1		1																					
6087	3	The cyclist choose to take an old abandoned route to @LOCATION1. The route had in some places no buildings at all to see making the cyclist loss hope of his need for water. Until the end there was no one on the route making him all alone. So if something happen who would know. During his adventure he ran out of water making him dehydrated that didn’t help. The setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
6090	3	"There are many ways that the setting affected the cyclist. One way is in the story when it says that it was very hot, he could become dehydrated and could possibly have a heat stroke, also the rodes were windy. This could be a problem because hes tired so he might not be able to go around the turns, he might just keep going straight and then get lost even more. That is all about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story."	1	1		1																					
6094	3	"The setting affects the cyclist in a large way. He has a hard time going on his journey. He began to lose hope, get tired, and began to think he was going to die. The settings played the biggest role. It was very hot with no people or buildings around him. He had very little water and no place to get anymore. He then encountered a large snake which made it worse because he was in fear with no one around to help him. If he would have followed his own directions instead of the old men he would not have had this problem. The setting around him really made his trip a hard one with no water, people, towns, or buildings around him."	1	1		1																					
6098	3	"The setting of the essay didn’t really help the author at all on his journey. There were not many structures on the way. Either that, of the towns said to be, “a ghost town.” @CAPS1 this couldn’t have reassured the author that things were going his way. It also was very hot during his journey. The author says he is “traveling through the deserts of California in June.” Deserts are very hot places and June is during summer which is the hottest month so it had to have been extremely hot and humid. @CAPS1 all this must have taken a toll because he never really saw anything reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait store. So the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels."	3	2		3																					
6105	3	"In the stories, don’t exceed posted speed limit, there are some very descriptive settings. In the stories these settings have a great effect on the cyclist. Through these our settings the effects change. Some good effects some harsh effects. The first setting that is described do you is, ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" This setting gives you a vivid picture of were the cyclist is heading. This setting also establishes a happy sort of mood. Let the pretty picture is about to change. Not so much further in to the cyclist ride he noticed a change of terrain,"" flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is short on water, and is becoming very tyered. Seeing this just crushes his spirit. @CAPS1 riding hills hard, but ridding hills with our knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills. Both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. The first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride. But this all changes when he hit those horrible hills. Just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills, makes your legs hurt. Over all the features of the setting saposed an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward by beautiful place.      "	3	3		3																					
6119	3	"The setting in this short story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is a hot, sunny desert, in which all towns have been abandoned, “The sun was beginning to beat down” (@NUM1) “ i arrived at the first town it fit the defination of a ghost town (@NUM1) trational. The cyclist at this point is not, tired and worried about the lack of water. The setting and cyclist’s state run side by side."	1	1		1																					
6137	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the worst the features get the more he wants water. For example, in the essay it said at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculous large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me when I think of tumbleweeds I think of dryness because it is like dry grass and when I think of snakes I think of heat because that is the time for snakes to come out when ot gets hot. So the cyclist was thinking about dryness of his throat and the dryness of his sorrounding making him want water. Another feature is when he seen a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth probably making the cyclist wishing he could have that cold refreshing drink."	2	2		2																					
6140	3	"The settings of cyclist affects the way cyclist perform. If the weatheris too hot then the cyclist might slow down because of the sun beating down on them. If its too cold, the cyclist puts on more clothes which might weigh them down from achieving the speed they need to obtain. The bike has to be stable. Riding on rough roads, braking, speeding, chains in good conditions. The area were the cyclists rides sets the mood. If its a nice scenary the cyclist might be in a wonderful mood as to the scenary being dark and gloomy with nasty weather behind it the cyclist might not be as happy as they could be. These typess of things @MONTH1 help determine how settings can affect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6146	3	"With little water the setting was not helpful to the cyclist. Joe @PERSON1 said, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” (@PERSON1). After receiving bad directions from a few old men having people passing by in cars or near by stores would probably help the cyclist for asking directions. @PERSON1 said, ""working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength"" (@PERSON1). Having no water to replenish your body will make you weak and unstable. In the middle of no  where that is a problem. @PERSON1 also said, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (@PERSON1). With little water left and a weak body it must have been hard going up and down those @NUM1 also said, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (@PERSON1). I dust in your lungs and heat from the sun as it becomes harder for your body to work."	2	2		2																					
6148	3	The features of the setting affect the cycleist in many diferent ways. For example it was June and he was in the @CAPS1 of California. It was very hot and the dehydrated him. Also he did no know where he was going so he had to rely on other people directions. Also he had to keep dehydrate. That what affected the cycleist. 	1	2		2																					
6156	3	"The feature’s of the setting affect the cyclist because, the cyclist is dehydrated and has to nde on a horrible conditions of a road, snakes and hills. All of these features act like obstacle courses, which makes it hard to do what he’s trying to do which is recieve water. Also, with the cyclist being hot and in need of water he at this point is delinous and most likely doesn’t know whats going on. In the story the authors main feature of the setting is the road. “Rough road ahead.”  This explains the cyclist having to go on a rough road, and doing that dehydrated is very dangerous these are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist.  "	2	2		2																					
6160	3	"The features of the setting on the way to Yosemite National Park, greatly affected the cyclist. On the way to the park, the cyclist had encountered the heat of the desert in California. Besides the heat the cyclist had to overcome the rough terrain of the of the short, rolling hills. This made the cyclist tired and weary. Adding to his weakness, and the extreme heat, he also ran out of water, causing him to become dehydrated. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke...laugh.” This trip through the California desert greatly affected the cyclist by causing great exhaustion and dehydration."	2	1		2																					
6169	3	"The features of the setting in the essay “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” affected the cyclist in a negative way. The more and more he rode, he thought more negatively and had alot of doubt. The cyclist was not very confident, he thought he wouldn’t make it. For example, when the cyclist notices nothing in sight, his tone changes. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon telling myself that if I could make it that far , I’d be fine”. He seemed unsure and a little nervous. As the journey continued, the cyclist loses hope it seems. “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary” He does not see himself finishing this journey the more and more he rides in the middle of nowhere with nothing to be seen except “Rough Road Ahead” signs.

6173	3	Some features of the setting setting that affected the cyclist were signs that had speed limits. The sign affected the speed of the cyclist. Another feature was a hill on the route.

6180	3	"In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie. the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset. When the scenery is pretty and cheery, he is happy as well. This is shown when the author writes, “denyoved the serenity of an early- summer- evening.” This quote describes the scenery as a serre or peaceful place. His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, “denyoyed” One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cherry mindset. Therefore, the peaceful scery affected the cyclist by making him happy. the same can be said for merry scenery too. This is found when the author says, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke”. This quote, describes the scenery as a place that they tumbleweeds. Steryotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely place. This lonely scenery takes it if full on the cyclist. He becomes pessimist and is making of all that could go wrong, not all that could get better. This is found around us every day. The poor and homeless who live with a low standard of living are often said. They have to exist with the affected the cyclist. In conclusion, the seeing does affects the cyclist and his mindset drastically."	3	2		3																					
6181	3	"The features of the setting affect of the cyclist because the setting changed so drastically. The flat wide open road turned into to “short, rolling hills”. Because he was already running out of water it was making harder for him to have the will power and determination to go up and down these hills. His determination started to fade because he started to see wide open lands with nothing but “tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes.” He felt like he was going to dehydrate because the sun was beating down and had no water left. He used pebbles that he had found to put in his mouth to help circulate the saliva he had in his mouth. He wishes that he would choke on one because he feels so useless. "	2	3		3																					
6183	3	"The terrain in “Do not exeed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist had to cope with many difficulties. He was already lacking water from the anduous journey and then the enviroment turned against him. The narration states, “I noticed the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills. Energy he barely has. This  will drain almost all the energy the cyclist has. Another example is, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that the cyclist is in the middle of nowhere with barely any water and energy, causing even more problems. In conclusion, the setting in, “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie caused many problems for the cyclist.  "	2	3		3

6210	3	"In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting effect the cyclist. They effect the cyclist’s confidence, and hope. I say this because through out the story he sees things that would consern other people like the towns that are suppose to be the best end up “Ghost towns” and the road from flat to hills. Yet he continues on and then says “what I believed was my last burst of energy,” “I was going to die.” The cyclist dosent think he can continue but manages to keep going hoping that the next horizon to see a building or something. Hope saved his life because if he knew he could not continue that he could die."	2	2		2

Oh yeah, and the setting was a desert."	1	1		1																					
6220	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Like he was in a desert, no one to give him good information, no towns close by that are still running, it was a hot summer day, no water near by. These affected the cyclist because they made him not sweaty, dry mouth, no energy, and he was having alot of doubt that he was not going to make his journey alive. In the story they cyclist said, ''I picked up some pebble and put them in my mouth. With my luer. I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn’t really matter. I was going to die. ''When he said that he showed alot of doubt. Everytime he got to a town or bulding it was abandoned. He saw an abandoned  building witch was ironically a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. That made him even more thirstier. Thats how the features affected the cyclist."	2	2		2

California is full of long deserts that can exceed @NUM1 degrees in sammer, and the cyclist was exerting himself so dehydration was inevitable.

6237	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist in many ways. At first when he sees the tall pines and the river he is calm: and chilled out. But when he sees the abandoned “@PERSON1’s Grape Juice” factory he becomes desperate and thinks he is going to die out in the desert. A guy travels to @ORGANIZATION1 where he meets “old timers and the give him a “shortcut” to the park. He then goes on his bike to the park taking their “shortcut.” While traveling starts to run out of water and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert. “It din’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water. This relates because he becomes desperate  for water because he is out in the desert in the midde of June.	2	2		2

6243	3	"The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist was in California, which is an extremely hot place in the desert in June. These features made dehydration a more keen possibility. Another example, is paragraph ten. It explains how the rough road, tumbleweeds, and large snake made it hard for the cyclist to keep his balance without water. Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice,this made the cyclist think more about water and  become very thirsty. Although thier was some possitive effects of the setting on the cyclist. The pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst. Also, the bait shopped allowed him to opt something to drink, and not die from dehydration."	2	2		2																					
6246	3	"The cyclist is dehydrated. He has lack of water for a significant distance before he realizes “that the old men would have been right,had he been riding,” before the last word war.” But any “town” he rode into, was just a run down, deserted, and abandoned piece of desert. He says,“It was a sad, hopeless, laugh, mind you, but at leas I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” @CAPS1 that he was getting more and more dehydrated, but was not quite ready to die. He still had enough energy to keep going, But “hope was fading.” Then all at once after climbing a large hill he gains all hope back. He sees “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp” The rider is safe now, he stumbles into the modern looking bathroom and drinks from the sink. He is now safe, ready to ride, and avoid all men who haven’t moved from their front porches in years."	1	1		1																					
6247	3	The harsh setting in “DO Not Exceed Posted Speed limit “by Joe Kurmaskie made the @CAPS1 for the cyclist more difficult due to the hot weather and the inconsistancy of the pavement. The very hot June day was a cause of the cyclist slowing down. “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This proves that the cyclist is very hot due to the summer heat. Another factor of the cyclist slowing down is the inconsistant of the pavement on the road “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” The @CAPS2 proves that the road could be slowing the cyclist also. It seems the cyclist has a lot against him. But if he keeps his head up he can make it to “Yosemite.”	3	2		3																					
6249	3	"Several features of the setting that affected the cyclist were time of year, the desert land, the lack of civilization, the lack of resources – especially water, and the rugged characteristics of the land. The cyclist was traveling during the summer time, which was the hottest time of the year. He was also traveling through the deserts which create an even hotter climate. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” was a quote from the selection that tells us this. If he had been traveling in the @DATE2, for example, he @MONTH1 have been more comfortable. Throughout his trip, the author does not after come desert civilization. He runs into a deserted factory and miles of land without people. The fact that he is traveling through desert terrain also helps us realize that water is scarce. He has trouble finding a place to get water. This made the trip extra hard and discouraging. “I was going to die” he says. As he travels farther, the land also becomes harder to travel on. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” this characteristic is a setting, like the others, negatively affects the cyclist by making his journey harder."	3	3		3

There is a pace that makes him feel like nothing wrong. “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” After about @NUM1 miles on the cold, his life was getting low, and he came to his second abundant place. He then felt a little disturbed and worried. He needed to find a place with water. “This site was trebling.”  There he fins water plant not his hopes rise a bit, until he finds the water isn’t good. “A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brickish water feeling some which is in the neighborhood of two hundred trees”. So he moves on and finally he re aches life! He is so relieved he can’t believe his luck.” Then as easily as rounding a body my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me “The setting affects the mood in a very big way, the cyclist feels as the setting looks."	3	2		3																					
6262	3	"In the essay Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the surrounding setting affected the cyclist. The setting was somewhere outside Lodi, California in early summer. The cyclist took advice from some old men that led him to difficult places to get out of. As the sun made things better and his water started to deplete getting to Yosemite was much harder. The cyclist was traveling through high deserts of California in June. When the terrain started to change from flat road to rolling hills the cyclist pushed himself even harder to get to his destination. The sun and hot air dehydrated him faster. After traveling over, ""along, crippling hill,”  the cyclist had to stop and even tried sucking on apebble in an effort to take his mind off thirst. When he found a habited store he was exhausted and relieved. Then features of the setting had a big effect on the cyclist. The weather dehydrated him while the terrain exhausted him.

The physical effects of the cyclist because of the settings all apparent throughout the story. For example, the cyclist reaches @PERSON2 and @PERSON1’s Fish Camp, he is able to hydrate once again. The positive effect makes the cyclist healthy and safe once again. The setting mentally, @CAPS1 the cyclist very substantitially. This can be seen when the cyclist in the comfortable camp around in @LOCATION1. He feels happy in this area. This positive effect prepares the cyclist to go on the trip to Yosemite. Also, when the cyclist reaches the “Ramshackle @CAPS2, several rusty pumps, and a corral, “he feels troubled. He is negatively affected mentally by the little amount of available water. In addition, the cyclist felt ""sad"" and ""hopeless” when cycling in the Dry, arid terrain. The cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place. Finally, the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp. He describes the feeling by saying that his trouble are now “behind” him. Settings positive effect in this instance changes mental state from negative to positive. Setting was the main factor in deciding upon the cyclist’s physical and mental state.

6267	3	"The setting of the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” effects the cyclists physical and emotional attitude. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist, “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on [his] face.” It was not too hot yet in the morning. So, the cyclist was happy and strong. He was confident he could conquer anything. As the day grew on “the sun was beginning to beat down” He was beginning to drink lots of water but he was still confident and strong. “I came to a ramshackle shed [and] several rusty pumps the sight was troubling. “The cyclist was travelling in the hot deserts of California. He was becoming tired and thirsty. He had to save as much water as possible. What started as a confident ride into the desert became a survival ride. Once the cyclist findswater he is relieved. He feels more confident and can ride to his destination. The weather and setting can affect us emotionally and physically just like in the essay, the cyclist became tired both physically and emotionally as the hot, sunny day went on."	2	3		3																					
6271	3	"The hot, dry, and baron setting affect the cyclist greatly. Baron is a hot, dry and abanded place. The cyclist is trying to ride his bike to Yosemite national park. He decides to follow the directions of coaple old men, which was a mistake.”…Simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades,”(Kurmaskie). The hot and dry conditions made the cyclists hardest obstacle to be staying hydrated."	2	2		2																					
6276	3	"As if along bike ride through the city isn’t grueling enough, the author of this story had it much worse. First the climate was a recipe for a disaster. “High deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 is clearly a debilitating factor as is direct sunlight and humidity. If the cyclist did not have the proper gean he could be hurt by all three of these factors. Secondly, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS2 his endurance is being tested because it is going for tolerance energy and will power to climb each individual hill. Most importantly, with his lack of water in his bottles, all of these characteristics were harmful. Within a desert, water is to be found nowhere. In hot weather, the water bottles will turn warm and in sunlight, water could even evaporate. To me, it seems like the setting and the weather were the perfect combination for doing much more harm than good."	3	2		3																					
6280	3	"The features surrounding the cyclist effect him greatly. All he has around him are hills, rough terraine, sand + tumble weeds. These features leave him thinking he will die because there is no life around him. Everything is dry + vivid + thats how it makes him feel. The old, rusty water pump shows that it hasn’t been used in ages + the black tar pumped out is no help to his negative thought of life."	3	3		3																					
6281	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Ranging from temperature, surroundings, and the availability of water. First of all, the cyclist felt tired and exhausted because of the temperature and terrain, For example, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I can imagine the cruelty of the heat beating down on him while riding down the roads. It would make me tired and exhausted also. Second of all, the surroundings as he rode affected him and made him have less confidence as he rode further. For example, “This place might have been a thriving little spetatore time say, before the last world war-last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” It shows how the information he had been giving caused him to feel unsure of where he was going. I’d feel uncapable and would do the same in his situation. Lastly, the lack of water made him scared. For example, “conserve my water and go instead for an hour or so a lest of my inner spirit.” It made him think the situation wasn’t good. So as one can see, it affected the cyclist in many ways."	1	1		1																					
6282	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the author uses features of the setting to show the effects of the cyclist.

Also, on this short cut he almost runs out of water. The essay ststed I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or se – a test of my inner spirit. He is running out of water but has the determination to get to @CAPS1 last the terrain affects him. The Hills prove to be a challenge with a limited supply of water. The essay states. Flat roads were upleed by sheed, rolling hills. This shows he is extremely determined. Even though the hills added to the struggle he made it through. That is how the author used features of the setting to add to the struggle of the cyclist."	3	3		3

He entered the desert happy, hopeful and determined. As his water reservoir began to disappear, and he approached the sight of the old shed, canal and a couple water pump, he began to feel touched. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and “tested like battery acid”. As he rode on, his confidence only faded more. He travelled through the desert and “ridiculously large snake” and was running low on water. Finally he saw a building in the distance, which ironically enlights was an abandoned juice factory a sign featuring a left sipping on some succulent icy liquid teased ruin, and he began to lose hope. He didn’t think he would make it to his destination or anywhere else for that matter. Although after approaching the old factory, he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy was founded."	3	3		3

For starters it says he was “traveling through the high desserts” which is never a safe thing. He had been drinking he water regularly but the temperature was rising. He was, “trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state.” From lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into “A far like substance” The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6309	3	In the story the features of the setting effect him because he was running out of water. He also had to manuver around a snake. It made him tired and dehydratied. His muscles got sore from the rough terrain. He got dehydratied from the sun.	1	1		1																					
6315	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a couple different ways. When the cyclist found the gohst town since no one was there he could not ask someone for better directions or get some food or water. The short rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is hard to pedal uphill. At the end of the story he found a bait shop where he got water and better direction's.	1	2		2																					
6320	3	"@CAPS1   the  story  the  condition of  problem  often effected the mood of the cyclist . For  example when the sign said ,â€� Rough road ahead: Do not exceed  posted speed limit.â€� @CAPS1  this time he saw a snake he was scared so he eased  past trying to keep balance while he was  dehydrated . The dry and hot climate began to become problem for the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6327	3	"In the story, the cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that he can complete the whole ride. But after he left first town he had been riding and needed water, so he stoped at a fork in the road he had just to;to get water from a pump which tastes like battery acid. Then as he progressed further in his trip he came to a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limit”(Joe Kurmaskie pg @NUM1) This part of his trip made it very challenging by making him face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross which sucked the water out of him. Then as  he came over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gart store. So when he arrived he got some water and got directions for a man who had the best map. So you can see that going over an the mountains, sucks all the water out of the cyclist, so he was so relieved when he got the water at the end."	2	2		2																					
6330	3	"The features of the setting in which the cyclist is in change his outlook on the trip. When he first begins his trip, the road is fine, so he becomes confident. When the terrain began to change, he writes, “sometimes life can feel so cruel”, he grows despairing as he faces new terrain with so little water. When he begins to see a building, he becomes hopeful and determined. However, when he realizes its old juice factory, he grows bitter. When he leaves the factory, he feels ??? all hope. The comparison can be shown when he writes, “somehow i climbed away from the abandoned factory of of juice and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" @CAPS1 the end, when he is revived with water he almost looks back on the journey comically.

The weather is described as hot as, ""The sun [began] to beat down."" He, ""was traveling through the high deserts of @CAPS1 can June."" Because of the excessive heat, he needed more water, which shortly became the conflict of this story. As things got more difficult his attitude towards the old men’s advice changed from gracious for their help to wishing he had never listened to them. Also as the difficulty increased his detirmination to move on also increased by, ""telling [himself] if [he] could make it that far, [he’d] be fine."" @CAPS2 for the cyclist, the settings affect was negitive.

He eventually came to a fishing store where he refreshed with alot o f water from the sink, and then was off again on his way to Yosemite."	2	2		2																					
6347	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist for a few reasons. One reason is that it makes it easier to picture how the cyclist feels. Also it makes the cyclist seem a bit insane for doing what he’s doing in weather that he could, “drop from heatstroke.” @CAPS1 reason is that the weather is affecting the cyclist so bad that he’s seeing a mirage of a “building-abandoned years ealier.” The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the conditions seem impossible to make it in."	2	3		3																					
6351	3	"Many of the features of the setting effect the cyclist. The most obvious and direct feature would be that this adventure took place in the “high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 about that passage says blistering heat; high meaning its going to be closer to sun, deserts, where the world is hot, California, which is known to be smoggy, and June, which is the middle of summer. Also, the closet water supply was “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,” there was a “long crippling hill” all while the sun was heating down.  All of that would most obviously effect the cyclists by making him tired, which he vividly explains by expressing his fears of losing conscionous."	2	3		3

When he was cycling it be came very hott to him but at first it wasn’t so bad. “The sun was begining to beat dow, but I barely Noticed it.” This proves that the cyclist knows it was getting hot but it did not affect him. Another thing that affected him was the time that he was travling in. “I had been hitting my water bottles pritty regularly and I was travling through the high dezerts in califonia in June.” This proves that the reader was constantly drinking because of the time of day and year he was out.

""@CAPS1 through the high desert of California"" is surely never an easy task to begin with. Without proper hydration, people often suffer heatstrokes or pass out, sometimes even perishing, it is entirely worse for this cyclist because of the effort he is exerting, pedaling over “short, rolling hills.” Even worse, the trail a few very old, eccentric men set run on doesn’t do much in the way of nuping with a depleted water supply. The first town the cyclist comes across easily splits “the traditional definition of a ghost town” and the only other water pump he comes to emits only sewage and incredibly hot brackish water. Therefore, the heat is only made worse by the look of water on the cyclist path. This combination of features in then setting causes a great deal of distress to the cycling, and almost pushing him to death."	3	2		3

Also the author says that the tarren changes from flat roads, to short rolling hills, which also made it more difficult because the short hills made it more work, and since it was so hot and he didn’t have water he couldn’t funcation as well as if he was hydrated."	2	2		2

6513	3	"The setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his ride. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke (pG @NUM1 kurmaskie).” This quote is saying that because of the heat, the rough terrain and the length of his “shortcut” his running out of water. That’s when he realizes he could die from heatstroke because he listened to a bunch of old men."	2	2		2																					
6514	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is in the desert and has a low supply of water. Without water he tired very easily .On top of that he had to pedal a bicicle. So he was thirsty and tired prambeing in the desert. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
6525	3	"The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead."	2	2		2																					
6526	3	The setting really affected the cyclist. Since he was in the desert on a bike he was going to be hot and tired. Which would come from the sun coming down on him. You know he was hot where it said “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.”	1	1		1																					
6532	3	"In the essay “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First, the sun is making the cyclist hot and dehydrated. He states “The sun was beginning to beat down,” @CAPS1, the sun was a big factor on the affect on the cyclist. Also, the hills of the country roads. Going up and down hills take alot of work you have to use alot of energy. The cyclist says “@CAPS2 were replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS3, there were snakes in the road, which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit. Againg the cyclist states “dimond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS4, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes. The factory even made him more thirsty. @CAPS1, there were many affects on the cyclist due to the setting."	2	3		3																					
6535	3	"The feature of the cyclist and the settings arn’t that good. There’re insidents that are a problem. One is the bad weather. There is a tempature that makes it feels pretty close to @NUM1 degrees. He stops at a water pump, water comes out but it is really not cool. He takes two little sips and its like battarey acid. If he would to drink alot of that water it would probably kill him or make him very ill. He needs something because there was another town @NUM2 miles down the road so he has to find something to keep him going. As he is going down the road he sees a sign: Rough Road Ahead: Even though he is going 12 mph he could still hit a hole and go flying over his handle bars. If he does go over his handle bars he could run into the snake he saw then get eaten by the birds because he wouldn’t have any energic to get up. There’re some interesting sence in the story."	2	2		2																					
6537	3	The features of the setting affect the setting affect the cyclist by. Dehydrating him due to the heat and lack of water and to see mirages. And he loses strength going over the many hills. And there is a very large snake he has to ride by that could have bitten him.	1	1		1																					
6540	3	In the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed limit” a cyclist takes a journey through terrain to get to Yosemite. In that part of California there are not a lot of towns or people. The rode he is rideing on is very dangerous and long. It is very dry and hot out there but	2	2		2																					
6550	3	"The setting affected the cyclist, because he didn’t know if he was going to die or live. He had used up all his water because it was so hot and his mouth was dry."	1	1		1

Towards the beginning when he was enjoying his ride no said ‘’ The cool pines and rushing rivers of  Yosemite had my name all over them,’’ As time goes on and he begins to realize nobody inhabits the path he is on he becomes continues and the terrain become rougher."	1	1		1																					
6563	3	"The features of the setting have a big impact on the cyclist. One feature is the hot weather and area he is in. He says he is in the “high desserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 being hot in @CAPS2, it has cyclist is around deserts, causing more heat. “I could drop from a heatstroke,” he says. Being hot from the sun beating down on him took away the cyclist’s energy he needs for riding his bike. Another feature that affected the cyclist was his lack of water. “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This affected the cyclist by making him tired. Being tired from no water, the cyclist had trouble going up hills on his bike. The last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” These hills made it hard to go up on a bike, considering his lack of water, and the heat. All of these features affect the cyclist by making him lose energy and get tired and frustarated because of their negative impact."	3	3		3																					
6566	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. First, the “town” The cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town. Although the cyclist chuckles about it, this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has a head of him. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist. For example, “…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on. The change from flat land to hills affected his stamena and will to keep going. He really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill. His determination finally led him to, “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp…” (pg @NUM2). He finally found hope.   "	3	2		3																					
6568	3	"The desert like land affected the cyclist by making him tired and loss of body water, then that therefor making him need water to go on. I think the thought of being so thirsty made him become more weak. If he wasn’t thinking about it the ride wouldnt have bin so ruff"	1	1		1																					
6571	3	"In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” there are many features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. Many of these features affect him in a negative way. One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony. Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist. “I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.” All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end."	2	2		2																					
6576	3	"The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist by describing that he is in a desert-like area in Lodi, California. They say it is very hot and there is sand everywhere. There also aren’t many places to cool off at. They also described the water and Lodi to be about @NUM1 degree in temperature. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite to get away from the heat and to have a cool, shady pine trees to sit under, and cool fresh water. This affects the cyclist because he gets dehydrated because of the horrid heat."	2	2		2																					
6578	3	"The conditions for the cyclist in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” are pretty dangerous. “a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement balance my dehydrated state bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (kurmaskie, @NUM1). There was a rather large snake in his path. You can tell he isn’t an expert on snakes because he couldn’t identify it. Because he is in the desert on a long bike ride, he is dehydrated. His water supply is almost gone. The cyclist feared many dangerous challenges in his journey."	3	2		3																					
6582	3	"The setting of the short cut affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, he said there was rusty water, and ""it tasted like battery acid"" because of this he was not able to drink it which made him become dehydrated. Also in the story is says, ""flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills."" This could of made the journey even harder for the cyclist because now he had a little more effort to get up the hills one more example is towards the end he says ""i began breaking my ride down into distances, i could see the horizon telling myself i could make it there."" By the cyclist saying this it seems like he has given up and he realizes that this journey is going to never end untill he dies. That is how the setting on the story affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6592	3	"Many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is biking through deserts. “A rediculously large snake” this quote shows that only is weather and climate agasint him but also nature.” I could drop from heat stroke” another great quote showing how hot it really is where the cyclist is.” There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” A great detailed desciption of where the cyclist is and how deserted the area is.” The bottle only contained a few  tantilising sips.” This cyclist is low on water in the desert and in the desert with no water that could be a very bad thing. The above quotes really draw you in and you get to see the many features of the setting and what its like for the cyclist."	3	2		3																					
6593	3	"The features of the setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” Affect the cyclist in many ways. First in the essay when the @CAPS1 says he is in the deserts of California, that can affect because it gives them an idea of how hot it most likely was out there and how lack of water can really harm someone. Also when the @CAPS1 describes the water pumps and what comes out o them, it can give the cyclist a feeling of disgust and remind them to always keep a good water supply."	2	2		2																					
6594	3	"Many things in the setting of the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affected the cyclist throughout his journey. One very important part that affected the cyclist greatly is the fact that he was in a deserts without a good supply of water. Another part of the setting that challenged the cyclist was the length of his journey. Those two factors of his journey to Yosemite combined are probably the worst and most challenging things that affected the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6602	3	"The features from the essay affect the cyclist in many was because he is getting field, and is drinking more and more water. The raods are getting rough so he needs to slow down. If he slows down he will get tierd and need more water although he is all out on top of that the old men really didnt know what they were talking about the features affect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6605	3	The setting affects the cyclist. He starts to see things that will affect his mind. Passing there is rolling around him he starts to feel abandoned and misled because there are no signs is going to right way.	1	1		1																					
6608	3	"The features of this setting effect the author while he is cycling. They changed his hope to doubt. There were no buildings or cars, which led him to believe he would never get to Yosemite. Also, it had a rough terrain that made him doubt that he would ever get water. Im sure if the setting had buildings, people, even just civilization, then the cyclist would of been fine."	1	2		2																					
6612	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways. The features of the setting affect the cyclist through the posted speed. Due to how the setting is the cyclist have a rough hill with wish.	1	1		1

6620	3	The features affects the setting of the cyclist because in some ways they through you off a little with others lines and then will get confused of what their acually talking about. The littlest thing that could through you off is the line when it says before the last world war. That kind off through me off alittle.	1	1		1																					
6623	3	"The cyclist pedaled through all types of different terrain. Through   hills, high desert, flat roads and the woods. This cyclist took the advice of bunch old men who thought they knew a short cut to the Yosemite national park. This short cut turned out to be a nightmare. The cyclist had only brought so many water bottles and was quickly drinking them all. The setting of this story changed a lot making the cyclist at   times have to pedal faster and slowes. The cyclist was quickly worn out and started to loose hope in himself. The  terrain kept changing making it  hard for him not to be thirsty. Eventually he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or a heat stroke. As he came up over a long hill he saw a bait store and stopped inside to have a drink vowed not to listen to a bunch of old guys again."	2	2		2																					
6624	3	"The features of the setting make him happy because he meets some people that tell him of a route that will take a lot of time off his trip.

6627	3	"The rider in the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie has a very analyzing mind, which is affected by things around him. At first, the rider “rode into the morning...with a smile” because of the bright sun, and the “cool pines” and rushing rivers”...he is very confident with the old mens directions, this first sign of disapointment is when he comes to the “ramshackle shed...” And the “...sight of this was troubling...” to him, but he rode on. He thinks as he rides over the “crippling hills” that maybe this wasn’t such a great idea. Finally he comes to a old bait shop, and the “modern bathroom” that he enters to drink from, gives him relief from the desert he had just been riding through."	2	2		2																					
6629	3	"At first the trip was easy going and flat. It was a nice day out and the water sapply was draining. Soon, the path became hills and soon got rough.

Eventually he reached some what civilization after enduring a grueling climb and by cycle trip through the woods."	1	1		1																					
6630	3	"The essay on ""Rough Road Ahead"" is about the dangers of speed and assault. It’s just letting you know to follow instructions and read signs. You should always keep close @NUM1/= out for signs and things.  "	1	1		1																					
6633	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.For example, ""I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This quote shows that his surroundings were giving him diffuculty and a challenge for his travel. By describing the hills as ""rolling"" it helps the reader imagine the obstacles he was going through. Also, the sign that read, ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger. Lastly an example of the setting that helps shows the charcters hardships is, ""no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any hand."" If anything were to the happen to the character, as the author was foreshadowing, he'd be stranded and all alone to die. He'd be in trouble and there would be no one to help him. If the author did not use these examples, the reader would not easily get a picture of the troubles he had to overcome. In conclusion these examples added emphasise and meaning to the text.

6642	3	At first he was mad because he took advise from old men who never left their porch. He got scared he was going to die because had he drunk all his water and he didn’t know how long it would be till he got some more.

6643	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist, in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, in many ways. The cyclist is affected because the setting is depressing and frightening. When the cyclist first sees the speed limit sign of 55 mph, he says, “Sometimes life can be so cruel”. Because he can only go 12 mph considering he's on a bike. After seeing the sign, a snake crosses his path. He’s frightened by it because it looked like a diamond back and he was trying to keep his balance and ease past it. Since the main problem the cyclist is faced with is the lack of water, the dry, long hills seem to make him more weak and tired. Tumble weeds crossed past him and there was no water in sight That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6644	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. It made him become dehydrated. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 sentence @NUM2 he stated “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This shows how the heat and climate of the setting affected him by how he was getting thrown off balance and wears     to him getting dehydrated.

I turned out that their short cut was wrong. When the rider went on this trip, it was June in California. It would have been burning hot. Lastly he had drank most of his water during the trip. He could have died if he didn’t find the other water source. These were some elements that effected the rider on his trip."	2	2		2

Also being that he didn’t have enough water when he went on riding, caused him to be real dehydrated. He should of turned back as soon as he ran out of water. Plus the heat made him real hot and thirsty. He should know how to never trust any strangers and try things on his own."	1	2		2

Mirages appeared, or so he thought. He actually thought he might die. Not quite an optimistic one is he? “ It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean…” The heat must have been bad, he wasn’t thinking straight and was slowly checking himself into a mental center!

6680	3	"The features of the setting in the story “DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, affect the cyclist in the story, in many ways. The first of which would definetly be the lack of water the cyclist had, and the fact that there wasn’t anywhere around for miles. From the text it read “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This evidence from the text proves to the reader that the cyclist was getting worried. Another part of the setting would be the obvious element of temperature. The cyclist is our in the hot, relentless desert. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The author here, by using the elements of nature, is trying to make the reader concerned/scared for the main character. The final key had to travel and the road conditions. Although the desert is flat, he began to notice some hills in the road, and such a long distance, including the heat, could be deadly. The setting’s elements, greatly effect the cyclist in this story."	2	3		3																					
6681	3	"The cyclit of “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, was greatly affected by the setting of his bike ride, which caused him pain and displeasure. He travels in the high deserts of California in June, which he exaggerates that water there was “@NUM1 degers”. The great heat caused him to drink lots of water, depleting it much quicker than he would’ve wished. It also sopped the energy out of him, further complicating his ride. Along the way there is literally nothing there and he has nowhea  to replenish his water supply. The hilly, rough terrain also calls for hard, tough peddling, sopping even more energy. The heat, terrain, and lack of places to stop combined for an awful ride for the cyclist of this story."	2	2		2

A lack of water feeling two hundred degrees...it had the flavor of battery acid."" The only water that the bike is able to find is not consumable. The most important of the factors, in the matter of survival, is the fish camp that the biker finally reaches. ”I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.” The biker had been on the brink of dehydration and the fish camp is where he finally reganed the strength to continue on his journey."	3	3		3

Second the conditions of the road affects the cyclist. In the essay the cyclist explains that, ”Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” A final feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the temperature. The hot sun beamed down on the cyclist. As you can see, the features of the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affects the cyclist in many ways.

6698	3	Setting plays a big role in this story. Without being in the desert in the hot @DATE1 there would not be a confict. There would be no importance in saving the water so he would not dehiderate.

6704	3	"The features in the setting of the essay affect the author in one major way, dehydration. There are several features that causes the author to dehydrate. First off, he is riding throught a desert located in california. This means that there is bent from the sun constintly beating down on him. Also the change from “Flat read”, (Kurmaskie) to “short, rolling hills” (@CAPS1) also affected him, getting dehydrated. This change cased him to use more energy to climb up the hills which means he used more water because he got thrister faster. This is how the features in the setting affected the author of the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.”"	2	2		2																					
6709	3	"In the story the author says, “The sun was beginning to beat down trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,” This gives you the idea that the heat is getting to him and is steadily depleting his water supply. At ore point he almost gives him self up to despair and dies of dehydration. It seems that he will never reach his good and he will continue to suffer in the grueling heat. I could almost feel the sweat and heat that the cyclist was feeling. Also, I could almost feel the lump in my throat when he says, “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge a pebble in my throat.” The heat definitely effects this mans cycling in a bad way. He was exhausted and could not go on without water."	2	2		2

Some features that are mentioned in the story are heat, rough road, long crippling hills and a abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst. @CAPS1 does her best to conserve her water through out the trip but the dry dessert heat doesn’t allow it. Then comes the rough road ahead. The cyclist trys to keep a steady and secure pass as @CAPS1 peddels along the bumps and breaks in the road. The long crippling hills are next in line the cyclist has to use all her energy to work up the hill. @CAPS1 wipes the sweat from her eyes to make sure its not a mirage and then @CAPS1 see’s it the abandoned factory. This is where the cyclist loses all hope for if @CAPS1 doesn’t receive water soon @CAPS1 is sure to be eaten by the birds. “Then, and easily as rounding a band, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.

On the way to the new town he came to the bumpy road and going @NUM1 he was out of water but finally after his determination he made it to a place that was very nice. So as you can tell the features of the scenery road affected him greatly."	2	2		2																					
6737	3	Two of the biggest setting in this story is the desert and rolling hills. This would effect the rider becaus of the dehydration that he would experience.

So all together this would be a hard bike ride.	1	1		1

Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel.” Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist.

Some of the conditions were hot It was very hot and that makes it hard to think fast, move fast and make good decisions another would be there was lose gravel and that makes it tough to maneuver and you have to watch your speed. So he’s not going anywhere in a hurry. also there were lets of hills and that makes for an uncomfortable ride and a tiring one atthat. Adding to that he was fresh out of water and that can mean dehydration again bud judjment and even heat stroke or exoustion another bad thing is he was in the middle of nowhere so its not like he could stop. Some where we asks for a drink to, there was nothing around for miles. These things show how rough the rode was made because these conditions exsisted."	2	2		2

He has to ride up and down small and large hills through what he believes is a shortcut to his destination. He has a limited water supply, and he keeps coming cross ghost towns, where the only water is boiling brackish water that is unfit for human consumption. Probably the worst setting feature for this guy as the Welch’s Grape Juice Factory (abandoned of course). Adding salt to the wound was “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen” (kurmaskie @NUM1). To the narrator with his dwindling water supply, this billboard was especially daunting to him on his journey."	2	2		2																					
6773	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The winding road could affect his turns because he could turn to far one way and fall off his bike and get hurt real bad. Another feature that could affect the cyclist is grass on both sides of the road. If he tireds to take a short-cut and goes into the grass he could he could hit a rock and flip off his bike and get hurt. That is what the feature of the setting could affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
6781	3	"In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting the cyclsit is in effects him greatly. One evening when he was resting he got into a deep conversation with a couple of elders. Eventually they got to talking about his journey, and the two men gave him direction for a shortcut. “But on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” When he arrives at the first town, he finds it deserted, this effects the cyclist because has eventually going to need more water. As he continues, he comes to a slep in the road. “After I had arrested the first few of these a large highway sign jumped out at most read:ROUGH ROAD AHEAD:DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” This sign was indicating that the road was going to be bumpy, which makes it even more challamging for the cyclsit. So, the setting is very important in this essay because it has a lot to do with how the cyclist feels. When the abandoned towns come into pray, no enging to feel hopeless. When the road get bumpy, he gets tired. When he gets to an actual running store, he’s relieved."	2	2		2																					
6782	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because the features is just a brief preview of what the text is going to be about or who is involved in it. The cyclist gives you what you want and need to know so the affect would be about time the feature is finish play in noone would want to see the cyclist.	0	0		0																					
6787	3	"The setting of this story takes place with a man biking and then taking advice from old timers to a faster route. The biker knew from the start that he should have not given his map. But thinking the old folks knew the route he took theyre advice. What the biker should have done was look for someone to ask and make sure the route would work. But jumping to where he wanted to go led him to dehydration and much more struggle than needed. You should always think things out before you take action, just to be safe."	2	1		2																					
6793	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the old guys had worn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. So the features affect reading the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” was very dangerous and unsafe for people to ride on.	1	1		1

6804	3	"Author Joe Kurmaskie learns the dangers of a lifeless wilderness during his experience described in “do not exceed posted speed limit.” As a cyclist riding in one of the most undeveloped areas in California, the lack of water found in this setting proves crippling to his survival. The trails he was directed to had no towns or sources of fresh, drinkable water for days. The combination of constant exercise riding through the terrain, lack of water and recources, California summer weather and lack of civilization trained the author’s energy and caused him to suffer from dehydration. Too much exposer to these conditions could have killed him. The modern time period and year also caused the directions the author were given to be in accurate, and, thus, causing the cyclist to find him self in such a dangerous area of the country. The setting of “do not exceed posted speed limit” places the cyclist in a life threatening situation."	3	3		3																					
6808	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” because it goes to many different terrains. The cyclist starts at a town and his working his way to Yosemite when he decides to listen to a group of old men. He started out strong until he got to the first town, which was totally abandoned. He kept going to another abandoned town. He decided to keep going until he saw a sign. The terrain was a lot diffrent with rolling hills and tumbleweed rolling by and a snake. Through listening to the old men the cyclist almost died from the threatening heat and lack of water. The setting affected the cyclist even more seriously than he could have imagined."	1	1		1

6840	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making him hot and thristy most of his way. As he rode he started to get tired slowly and he got work and more thirsty. He drank his water at first with out thinking to much or it, but as he went on he slowly found himselfs trying to conseve it. By the time he got to the second wild town the will he was so thirsty and tired thathe thought it might of been a ""death"" So he wiped the sweat from his eyes."" to make sure it wasn't a mirage. The only time people see mirages is when the are hot,tired, and about to kill for some water.

6848	3	"this story is set in the hot in the hot desert in June and the character is a cyclist trying to get to a National Park. the setting affects the cyclist because the hotter it is the more water you need to keep you hydrated, but the man is alone in the desert. This quote “about forty miles in the pedal I arrived as my first “town”. The place might have been a thriving little syos as one time”. This quote shows how deserted the desert is and how as he rides there is nobody around no where to re-hydrate no where to get drecionsn he was alone."	2	2		2																					
6854	3	"When the cyclist began his journey he was confident in succeeding. Throughout the story however, the cyclist endures many conflicts to his successs in his journey. The cyclist faced his first difificulty once he reached a small, abandoned town. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist realized he had not conserved his water and his “water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (kurmaskie @NUM1). On top of his water problem the heat was unbelievable. He was losing hydration from all the sweat, and he was losing it quickly. The cyclist was also dealing with the difficult roads. There were many things this cyclist endured through-out his journey, but he was determined to finish his trip and was filled with satisfaction once he overcame these hardships."	2	2		2																					
6872	3	"The setting in the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" has a major effect on the cyclist. The setting is the high deserts of California"" where it is June and very hot. The path of the cyclist suggested by some old men makes the heat even worse because there are no people or water in sight. In the essay, the cyclist starts out the day confident and excited for his ride to Yosemite National Park. His mood changes throughout the day as after @NUM1 miles he arrives in a ""ghost town"" the old men led him to believe would be a settled town where he could get more supplies and cool off. Soon as the temperature rises to what feels like ""two hundred degrees"" the cyclist begins to run low on water and feels ""sometimes life can feel so cruel."" The heat and lack of people and water lead the cyclist to desperation and make him feel like as he says ""i was going todie."" The setting of the cyclists journey provides the mood of hopelessness and amplifies the feeling of determination felt by the cyclist to keep going at all costs because he was going to die if he stopped. The author, @PERSON1 uses the setting of the essay to help bring across his mesage that by blindly trustting people instead of trusting yourself things could end up being hard for you to overcome..

6873	3	"In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit” the cyclist sees many different settings when he left it was early summer and it was pretty hot outside. He rode into the morning when would make him tired. The first town he reaches upon was a ghost town so that means he could rest get his supplies. Then he arrive by cool pines and rushing river which probably makes him feel releaxed. Then he showed up at a ramshack shed with several rusty pumps and a carrol that couldn’t hold in the lamest made. Gated men which people made him feel uncocleible, and the pumps did not give him water so that was nobody also pointing. Then he was rideing through the California deserts in June witch probably made him more dehirrated."	2	2		2																					
6874	3	"The cyclist should have never taken the advice from the older men. The map would have been a lot safer and easier. People seem to always look for a shortcut, including myself. He could have died from heat stroke and lack of water. He did have perseverance though he never gave up and that is what saved him. Being in that situation and setting I would have given up."	2	2		2																					
6879	3	"In the story, the rider faced several meloncholy sites. For examples the “ghost town” that he ran into at first really put a load on him because he had no one to ask for futher directions or somewhere to freshen up. Futher on down the road the hill he came up on was a physical obsticle that he had to go over. With the sun beating on his back and the emptiness of the road he might have begin to want to turn back. He kept on persaveering which was how he made it down. The lack of water also mad it difficult for him. Traveling with his water running out and beginning to feel sick did not go well with him."	3	2		3																					
6896	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist, by putting him in unwanted places starting off with this man took advice from many older men, which don’t even know the area anymore. So riding through this man seems lost, he is trying to follow their advice, but comes across many unknown, unwanted areas. He starts out good, then comes to a “Rough Road” and he even says “sometimes life can feel so cruel”. Then he come to this large snake in the middle of the road scary enogth he has to slow ride past this thing taking up most of the road. Coming over these thing was very strong and hard of this young man."	2	3		3																					
6900	3	"The conditions and features of the setting caused the cyclist to be tired and dehydrated and think that he was going to die from it. For example, it says “and ther growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a georgus day in June”. Also , he thinks he is getting dehydrated when he says “I  was doing a water depleting 12 mph. sometimes life could be so creul”. in conclusion, this cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration."	2	2		2																					
6904	3	"“Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is an inspiring and almost humorous essay it take the reader inside a journey in a cyxlist daily routine. In this story the author fights dehydration as he tries to make to a national park with shortcut directions from “old timers” the setting of this storygreatly affects the cyclist and the pitty the reader feels for him. Half way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles; that’s extremely crazy. The fact that he is travelling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down. At that point he wasn’t really bothered. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, the rocky roads probably didn’t help his journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldn’t have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life. The setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through. "	3	3		3																					
6910	3	"Due to the features in the setting, including the hot summer weather, the cyclist not knowing the area, and the California desert the cyclist is affected. In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist is travelling through the hot desert in June when he realizes hes running out of water, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”(Kurmaskie). This is affecting the cyclist because hes becoming hot and has a low supply of water. Also the cyclist realizes he should have never taken the direction from the old men and thinks to himself, “…The growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June”(Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the heat of the desert is taking a toll on him."	2	2		2																					
6936	3	"In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects him negatively because he was on his bicycle and he was in a hot area and no water whatsoever, like  in this quote, “I  got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance ozzed out.” In the quote, the cyclist finally thinks he has found a water pump but he really gets nothing. Also, another negative thing is that he thought he was never going  to get to where he was going, but in the end , he got there and he got some water."	1	2		2																					
6943	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. For one, if the desert was not a deserted mountainous area, in California then the cyclist would not have the same problems. By changing anyone features of the setting you would change how the cyclist would behave in the setting. Thus changing the entire plot of the story. If the cyclist was say in the entry or a mere develop area then he would not face the same dangers as if he were in a mountainous region. The settings features have a huge affect on the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6950	3	"The features affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the road, the rocks everything close. The cyclist needs to know everything about where he's going, because if not then he can run into some problems along the way, For example like snakes, rough terrain, rocks in the way. That why its important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves. That why when you see cyclist you see them around, a road where theres cars around, just in case they get into trouble."	1	1		1																					
6957	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first was the terrain, which started out flat, then turned to hills. The cyclist was growing tired from all the pedaling. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This tired him out faster, since going uphill is harder than riding flat terrain. The heat definitely affected him, because it made him thirsty. He was “travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This is a very hot time of year, and when a person get lost without conserving water, which he had not done, a person get extremely thirsty. Not to mention the “sandblasted picture of a young boy pourng a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” which would remind the body of its thirst. So the setting most definitely affected the cyclist"	2	3		3																					
6958	3	"In the story, the cyclist iS greatly affected by the features of the setting. For example, the setting has no thing for miles. Just ghost towns, makes it imposible to find any water. Also it’s a desert like setting, adding to his thirst. Another example is the hills, that made him even more thirsty. It was June in California so it must have been pretty hot and also the town that he are to had no water because they seemed desorted. Another example is the state he put under his tongue. It’s a trick that lets you survive alot more effectively. Therefore the settings affected his journey and made him wish he didn’t take the old mans advice."	3	2		3																					
6963	3	"Heat, abandoned roads, snakes all are reasons that affected the cyclist. The heat made him get dehydrated faster while he was using energy. The long abandoned roads further increased his doubt of living the whole bike ride. He used up allof his water. So when he got to the old pump hot dirty water came out. The snake in the story made the journey for this guy perilous and deadly. This all happened because he listened to the old guys. When the other old guy was about to tell him whereto go he said no."	1	2		2																					
6966	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he was riding in the desert and all the towns he was going to were abandoned. The month was June a hot month and the sun was beating down on him. And he was cycling with very little water.  	1	1		1																					
6968	3	"The author’s setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding. The author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist. The author also that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to heat down. That means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat which lowers your water retention. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclist’s location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since he’s traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple town, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills. Hills take a bigger toll on a person’s body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill."	3	2		3																					
6971	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead ;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie he goes through all kinds of settings where the going could get better or worse. “I noticed the terrain changing, flat roads was replaced with short rolling @NUM1 Kurmaskie). This shows or explains that the going could get a little tougher now because he will have to be riding up hills and he is almost out of water. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” (@NUM2 Kurmaskie). This explains that the man could not get water or a ride from anywhere around, because there was nothing out there to at. This is how the setting features affected the cyclists."	2	2		2																					
6973	3	"The setting is described by the author, were very challenging for three reasons, distance, water and the heat. All of these only occurred to multiply the effects of the others. As time had went on, the cyclist grew tired from the heat. In one sentence the effect of the heat were clearly described by the cyclist"	1	1		1																					
6974	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. The scenery makes the cyclist turn worried, unconfident, and in the end an ironic hopeful. The cyclist came upon the first “town”, and described it as only having “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corrall” I believe this is when the cyclist realized the men were a little off, and began to worry: he also couldn’t refill water supply, so fear of dehydration also kicked in already tired, the cyclist became unconfident when he came upon the sign reading, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. Knowing that this was going to be a long and slow journey, the cycles becomes unconfident that he can make it, finally, when passing the sign saying, ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp – If you want bait for the big ones, we’ve your best bet,"" the cyclist reached a hopeful stage, because he knew he had found civilization once again. I believe your atmosphere and surroundings can effect your general mood, and that stands true today with the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6976	3	"The setting affects the cyclist becuse it is the passes is on a road much alot of hills it would affect him as being tired, or if the biter was in a place where the cold or hot it would affect him or his temp. and by his attiude."	1	1		1																					
6985	3	The setting of where cyclsit takes there journey effects the cyclist. The reason I say that is because in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclsit came upon a conflict with the setting. The conflict waas it was very hot and he did not use little things to survive witch he did. These are the reason why I say the setting of where cyclsit takes their journey matters.	1	1		1																					
6987	3	The cyclist was affected by long hours of riding the bike into the areas where he never been.	1	1		1																					
6989	3	"In the essay, “Rough Road ahead"" the character sees many settings through his ride, all of which affect his mood and physical condition. For example, when the author describes one place he came to as, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mute greeted me. Thes sight was troubling”, this was the turning point where the cyclist began to worry. He was running out of water, “The sun was beginning to beat down”, and he was probably tired of pedaling. But, to make matters worse, he came to rolling hills. This affected him because he had to work harder and had less water to pick him up. When he finally got to a “modernized” town his spirits were lifted, and he was able to get water to cool him down. This gave him more strength and will-power to continue his trip Yosemite park."	3	2		3																					
6994	3	In the essay rough road ahead the setting does effect the cyclist because he has been pedaling for so long and he is becoming dehydrated “I had been hitting my watter bottles pretty regularly. I was in the @LOCATION1”. Another reason the setting effects him is because he is starting to see mirages “A sandblasted picture of a boy pouring a refreshing glass of grape juice into his mouth could still be seen.	1	1		1

In the begining of the story the cyclist is riding through the “cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” @CAPS2 this time the cyclist is enjoying his trip and is in a positive mood. As the story goes on “there was no one in sight, not a building, a car, or structure of any land.” At this point in the story the cyclist has exchanged his positive mood for a desperate one as his water begins to run out."	2	2		2																					
7034	3	"The features of the setting only drain the cyclist's willpower. The things he sees discourage him, for example one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the larnest, mule greeted me. This sight was troubling .” The desolation begins to wear away his hope of finding a building or town sometimes the things are psychologically damaging,” In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it – had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” For someone who is quickly running out of water, this this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue. The snake and rolling hills slow him down, and make him use more energy. The heat dehydrates the cyclist even faster. The environment is a hostile one for a cyclist.    "	3	2		3																					
7045	3	"In this paragraph I will explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting affect the cyclist in ways such as weather, road structure, & animals. All things that the cyclist could not controll. Therefor affecting the cyclist while he rides through."	1	1		1																					
7047	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if is very hot and is summertime. The cyclist wouldn’t have gotten so tired and exhausted if he wasn’t in a “ghost town”, with the, “sun beggining to beat down”. It was in @CAPS1 for nia during June so it was. Very hot, the water was also @NUM1 degrees! The text as states there were rolling hills and tumble weeds, so it must have been a desert kind of area. The trip was also a very long one, “about forty miles into the petal”, causing him to be tired. As you can see the setting was an area with no people, and it was very hot."	2	2		2																					
7051	3	The features in the setting would affect the cyclist because they would want to have towns with water so they can restock they’re water. They would want water even more after going up hills. They would also want a palce to gey something to eat and maybe rest.	1	1		1																					
7052	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because of the heat and had know water. Also how rough the road ahead was. Another problem was the dry air and snakes laying out everywhere in the desert. Also the hills were a big problem to because of the heat and know water. Finally the other problem was he knew he was going to die and the birds would eat at him and their would be nothing left of him. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
7062	3	"The settings effect the cyclist by the roughness of the ride. First, they go over a bunch of rocks, and the tire could poys. Next it could be smooth and easy. Also, it could be far away from towns and difficult to get back. There could be a lack of water making you dehydrate. That is how the setting around the cyclist could effect him."	1	1		1																					
7063	3	"The setting desented in the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summer’s day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those sorroundings alive."	2	2		2																					
7065	3	"The features of the setting  affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting was a dry California desert, for if it had been a busting city, the events in the story would have not happened. The author asked a group of old men for directions to Yosemite National Park, and , “like a foolish yuuth,” folluwed their advice. Everything started out fine until he reached the second town. He –ans almost dehydrated and “in an ironic twist” he reached on abandoned grape juice foctary. Almost all hope was lost for him until he rounded the bend and came across his new hope: “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp-if you wont bait pur the big ones, we’re your best bet “ in He end he learned tostick to a map instead of old people who “haven’t left the confines of their purchess,hce carter was ,h office”"	3	3		3																					
7068	3	"In the setting there are no cars and no buildings meaning no help. The cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water. No one was around because it was the desert.

In the begining of the story, the author says, “Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” This is showing the readers confidence he has with himself before starting his trip. Later on in the story, he discribes the setting as “the high deserts of California in June.” He is discribing the heat + what he is facing. It goes on to tell how he is dehydrated in worn out.

Sometimes life can be so cruel.” In the horrible @NUM3 degree heat the narrator gulps down his water bottles at such a rate that he’s at risk of running out. Not only that but he’s been pedaling for such a long time that he @MONTH1 pass out from exaustion or,.” I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadnt been off their porch in decades.” So I would say the narrator was pretty hasseled by his surroundings.

Later he realizes the old men probably had no idea that things change overtime. He says “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven’t left their porches since carter was in office.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist takes the old-timers “shortcut” and it takes forever to reach his destination. At the end he reaches his campsite and another person askes him for directions. This time the cyclist says “Yes, sir! I own a very good map,” and “I’d always stick to it in the future.” The cyclist’s message is to follow a map, something you know is right, not a person that @MONTH1 be lying or irresponsible."	2	2		2

He started out with a “smile on the face.” (@NUM1) @CAPS2, things start to change @CAPS1 hits changing terrain. He writes, “…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote states the changing terrain. He starts to lose water to keep him going, yet he pushes himself to the next “town”. Finally, when the author reaches “Gary & Wilber’s fish camp” he is relived when he sees an old guy sitting. The two men say, “know The best way to get There? “Yes sir! I own a very good map.” This reveals that Joe didn t ask for more directions which was his first mistake. In addition, changes in setting can chang a persons mood and attitude."	2	2		2

His water bottle was slowly running outand the only town he came to that had water had water that tasted like batteryacid. Events seemed pretty bad, until the speaker became elated when they saw a @ORGANIZATION1 factory. The author was thirsty and the side of the building had “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The building was abandoned. The speaker then states “Somehow  I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope” (Kurmaskie @NUM3). He lost hope after that landscape, and he pretty much gave up. The landscape or features affected the author very negatively due to the lack of water.    "	3	3		3																					
7116	3	"In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. One thing is the water. There is little water and it is boiling hot. He took some taste of it. He said “It tasted like battery acide.” To me if the water is hot don’t taste it. Another thing is the land. The land went from straight to hilly. That started slowing him down. Last, is the day time. It started turning dark and he was still biking. He wanted to get as far as he could."	3	2		3																					
7126	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist is he is riding a bike through the dessert. He says “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” So he was scortching hot peddling a bike. The road became bumpy and curry. A sign had said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted Speed limit. The speed limit was @NUM1 and he was going @NUM2 so it must have been hard to get over all the bumps. The lastly he comes across and poisioness snake blocked the majority of the pavement infront of me.” So him dehydrated trying to get ground a snake would be terrifying. So on his @CAPS1 the setting doesn’t help him much.  	3	2		3																					
7127	3	"The cyclist ran into many issues in his/her travel to @LOCATION1. They had to dismiss many hardships such as lack of water, being lost, immense desert heat, plus minor things like snakes and road conditions. The setting of the California desert in June was the most intense hardship. That and the lack of water. Though the heat starting powing at the cyclists’ brain by making them see mirages, etc. The heat and entire setting made the cyclists’ travel much harder."	2	1		2																					
7128	3	"The setting affect the cyclist because in the hot heat of California in June which nobody wants to be outside. But first, was the heat which took a lot out of his body while trying to keep it cool. Then came the factor of which he had very little water when he reached the first town and in the story it said, “A tar like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” So now he has no cool water to drink when he says, “Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” So the cyclist has very little water is not having to endoor the hardest part of the ride. Then later on he makes a mention to change a paragraph if he loss consciousness. Also he talked about him might getting a heatstroke. Hinting to the fact that the setting he was in was affecting him in many different ways."	1	2		2																					
7130	3	"Anyone who has ever rode a bike knows how relaxing it can truly be, but when you are forced to ride miles and miles on @CAPS3 terrain without any water, relaxation feels like an oasis, @CAPS1 through beat-up roads with dryness all around you really puts a domper on your experience, @CAPS2  it extends your need for thirst by enhancing the amount of dryness in the air and the amount of energy you are having. The ability to block all of that out and trying to focus on something easier to handle is exactly what you want to do in these situations, @CAPS3 terrain can really build character into a cyclist, but  adding the fact the amount of water he had and the dryness around him, it sounds like torture. I can only hope that if I ever become a cyclist, I never have to endure this kind of situation."	3	3		3																					
7133	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist by lack of water, poisonous snake, the condition of the rode for example the lack of water affected the cyclist because he couldn't make it wi thout water he could of passed out if he didnt have water. Another example of how the setting affected the cyclist would be the poisonous snake if he would have  goten bitten he could have died cause there would be nobody to help him. And the last example of how the setting affected him would be the conditon of the road because it make it tougher for the cyclist to get to his destination with hills and windy rounds this is how I think the setting affected  the  cyclist."	2	2		2																					
7146	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he wasnt pre pared in the beginning, the cyclist got directions from an old man who hadnt left his porch in years so he wouldnt know what had changed. Then the cyclist starts his journey with not a lot of water. When he got to the second town “I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.’ This quote means that he wasn’t expecting hills, he thought it was going o be a flat way. Also in the @NUM1 degree whether with limited water supply, he couldnt ride up and down hills. Going down the hills gave him a break. Thats how the cyclist was affected by the settings features."	2	1		2																					
7147	3	"Alot of factors effected the cyclist. Temperature, terrain, directions all gave the cyclist doubt. The temperature through the high deserts of california left the cyclist feeling hot, parched and irratable. Through the story, he had all but a few slips of his water left. Knowing your running low of water “to feel sorry for himself” The cyclist had biked so far the terrain started to change from flat to “rolling hills”. This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levals before. Lastly, the feeling of hoped could have effected him the most. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome. Having just liesurly taken instructions by an old man cost the cyclist hours of torture. The author did a great job using hyperbole to exagerate the cyclists feeling of lost hope . He also used very detailed text to paint the reader a picture. These literay elements made it easier for me to understand the effect of the temp, terrain and hope had on the biclist."	3	2		3																					
7152	3	The features of the setting of were the cyclist are affect them very drastically. They need a water supply and if they don’t have one they might dehydrate or even die. They need shade trees because it keeps the sun from beaming down on them so hard. They also need to cycle when its not as hot outside so that just incase there water gets low there is a better chance of survival. It would be great if there was someone with you to help if you get hurt. There should be buildings near by just incase of an emergency. It might even be good to carry a cell phone.	1	1		1																					
7162	3	"In the essay, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature that affects him is his lack of water:"" The water bottles contained only a few tantallizing sips. The lack of water made him very desperate, especially when he came to the welch’s grape juice factory. The  building-abandoned years earlier-had been a welch’s grape juice factory and bottling plant."" This despersion, after he had come to the abondoned factory, was followed by dissapointment and a vague sense of hopelessness expressed by the phrase, ""I hung my head"" after he had found the abondoned factory. These are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
7176	3	"In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, the setting affects the way that the cyclist rides. In this story, the setting is out in nowhere wit no water, and all he can see is roads.

7178	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not having good directions from old timers. In the text it says, ''Never accept travel advice, from a collection of old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office,” this means that the cyclist did not have good directions. Because the road might of changed and the old timers do not know because they been sitting on there porches all the time. The is why I think the salling affects the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
7184	3	"In the essay “Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. One way it affected him was that the temperature was very hot and by it being hot outside his water wouldn’t stay cool. This is a problem because you need nice, cool, refreashing water to stay hydrated. Another way was when he hit a fork in the road. He didn’t know which way to go. All he saw was one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling. Last but not least this water pump wasn’t working very well so he got down on his hands and knees and started pumping. The water wouldn’t cool down. He tried a drop or two and the water tasted like battery acid. Those are some features of the setting that affected the cyclist on his journey."	2	2		2

7204	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they change the cyclist’s mood towards the rider. For example, in the essay “Rough Road Ahead;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” it states, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or sructure of any kind. I began breaking the ride clan into distances I could see on the horizon” The cyclist had to do this because they were having trouble riding since they were thirsty and the ride was very boring. This makes the ride seem larges so it also makes it harder to ride. Also in the essay it states, ""One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps” This affeted the cyclist because after seeing this and later realizing he could’t drink the water, he was more thirsty since he was running out of water. When the cyclist notices the Welch‘s grape juice factory, he bacames determined to get there. In conclusion, the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist mood towards the ride is strongly affected by the setting’s features."	3	2		3																					
7205	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. When he was going up hill it was harder for him to pedal. The hot summer day was breaking him down. He was getting dehydrated because he had a little bit of water left. It said he was trying to keep his balance in my dehydrated state. He felt like giving up.	1	1		1																					
7210	3	"The cyclist in Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit was greatly affected by the setting. There were no buildings or people to the town anywhere. This emptiness meant that there was no help from anyone and he could die with out anyone knowing. Also the setting seems to be very dry and have desert like conditions, without water the cyclist would be dehydrated and could suffer from a heat stroke. Also the setting seems to be very hot. The heartt also makes the cyclist physically dehydrated and mentally considers the logic of a heat stroke at the time."	2	2		2																					
7219	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the rougher the terrain got the more the cyclist had to strain to make it. For example, when the terrain turned to hills, the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills which caused him to use more of his energy. Also, if the terrain was flat and smooth, the cyclist had less problems making the long journey. For instance, if the cyclist had less strain on him then he would not be as tired and would not drink as much water. In conclusion, that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
7222	3	"In the adventures of the cyclist the setting is not only what developes the character but, that what affects how he pushes himself to not give up, even when he feels helpless. This is one example of how the cyclist is affected, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June,"" With that information you can observe how this harsh setting creates problems for him physicaly because his body needs water. Which he is extremely limited and doesn't savor it very well. These issues create the problem of dehydration, and when mentally you think your going to die without water. You start to panic and lose control over yourself."	3	2		3

In the text it states, ''I got down on my hands & knees working the handle of the rusty water pump a for like substance oozed out followed by @NUM1 degree brackish water that tasted like battery acid.’’ You know the setting disappoints him when he sees the terrain he has to cross as well. You can tell who he says ''At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridicuously large snake.'' The narrarator was disappointed that he listened to the directions of the elder rather than use his map. Joe Kurmaskie does a great job of making one narrarator faced & how he felt about them."	3	2		3

No one was there and he was out of water he did not know how longer it would be until he came tp another town. That is why I say that how the features of the setting affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
7231	3	"It is said that, ""experience is a good substitute for @CAPS1 instinct.” This means if someone knows how to deal with the environment they're in they can survive even if they weren't born with the animal instinct that come with the territory. However, even the most experienced person can be overcome by the extreme weather conditions they live in. In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the experienced cyclist decides to take a long, difficult, and dangerous trip. His ride will take him a long the long desert paths of California with a limited water supply. This is the major element that and him in the story. Because he listened to same old men he went without water for most of his trip. Between his constant excersise, extreme heat, and lack of water, dehydration hit him fast. A common side effect of dehydration is hallucination, which the cyclist knew. It says in the essay, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn`t mirage.” This represents his knowledge and experience in the matter, and showed that he was adapt to his environment through experience. A similar story to this is jack @LOCATION2's, “To @CAPS2 a fire” where the man is also pitted against extremes at nature through the vukor, but the elements still ovetook him. Both stories represents man's quest for adventure, and also the canstrant struggle for survival that people face. "	3	3		3

And last the abandoned welches grape juice factory had him almost abandon hope. The setting was effecting his mood."	2	2		2																					
7245	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist. Because the man didn’t have a lot of water and he was go into the California deserts in June. Another reason is because the flat road was changed into rolling hills and up ahead there was a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” the speed limit was @NUM1. One more thing is make sure you don’t listen to a gentleman that is old and hadn’t be off ther porch in decades. That is some of the things that can affect the cyclist.	1	2		2

7272	3	"The feature of the setting including the conditions, weather, and amount of water can possibly decide the life or death of the cyclist. The conditions such as hills, and rocky roads can decied a future for a cyclist because if the rocky roads turn you off balance you could fall down a hill and give yourself an injury or possibly die. For example, in the short-story it says, “over one long crippling hill, a building came into view” This shows the conditions in which the cyclist had to deal with. In addition, the weather and amount os water can also decide the future. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” This shows us that if the cyclist gets dehydrated enough he could pass out and no one would find him in the desert. In addition, the heat isn’t helping him out any once he could die without anyone knowing. These reasons show us a cyclist needs to make sure they have enough water and the conditons and weather is right so they don’t make a life-threating choice."	3	2		3

The second setting he arrived at was “One romshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest muic” he continued moving to the next town, which was @NUM1 away, he came to what he thought was a Welch's Grape juice factory and bootling plant.

As if the rough terrain wasn’t energy soaking enough, a snake blocked a majority of pavement and large elevations came into play. The harder the terrain, the harder for the cyclist."	2	2		2

The cyclist traveled through the desert to get to his destination. He started to run out of water because it was so hot and humid. He started to get dehydrated and could bairly keep his balance. In this story the cyclist had to pass a large snake “a ridiculously large"" snake – it realy didn’t look like a diamondback – blocked a majority of the pavement in front of me “(Kurmaskie).

The heat of the weather and lack of water makes the cyclist develop an uncaring matter. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps…with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” The verbal irony in this passage delivers a negative feeling to the reader and it is here that it is clear that the cyclist doesn’t care what happens to him.

The cyclist was becoming more and more dehydrated and the small, rolling hills didn’t help his dehydration, he also used a lot of energy in order to go over the hills. Finally, he found Gary and Wilber’s fish camp where he was able to get water. This whole experience in a way, affected the cyclist positively even though, at the time, he was affected negatively.

He felt so free and how he when he came over hills that are tall and large. But he mostly believed he could find his way at the end. He said it himself he always stuck in the future.

7335	3	"One of the biggest problems that the author faced in his essay was his surroundings. The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quote, “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This quote shows that even after many miles, he hadn’t seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization."	3	3		3

For example in the story it said, ”At same point, tumple weed crossed my path.” This is saying that he is in the desert or somewhere very hot because I know that you usually only see tumple weeds in very hot places. Thus, being in the desert affect the cyclist because he is already low on water then being  in a place as hot as the desert made him get even nor dehydrated. Another feature in the setting in this story that affected the cyclest is the hills he had to climb. This affected him because he was already  dehydrated and climbing hills made him have to work more which caused him to lose more sweat and become even more dehydrated. Those are two examples of how the features in the setting of this story affected the cyclest."	2	2		2																					
7340	3	The setting in this story is very hard for the cyclist. His main problem is the lack of water. If you deprive the body of water all of your major organs will bake in the hot sun. Another problem was the condition of the terrain. It is very hard to cycle on bumpy dry land. These are any a few problems the cyclist encountered.	2	2		2																					
7355	3	"The cyclist in “Rough Road @CAPS1; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” starts off in the “serenity of an easly summer evening” taking road advice from old-timers. At first when the sun was beating down on him, he didn’t mind; the thoughts of Yosemite kept him determined. Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his “short cut” was not so short after all. The “high deserts of California in June” and the terrain changed furthered his dehydration and need to find water. The emptiness of his surrounding with “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” made him focus on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, the he’d be alright. Finally, a building came into view. The hope he got from this gave him strength to move on. Ironically it was an abandoned building. The cyclist describes it as a “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant.” @CAPS2 this he had lost hope and hung his head. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike. Driving away from the factory, he saw a sight of a fish camp and immediately regained hope. Going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson, never take road advice from other people.  "	3	3		3																					
7358	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because his body has a hard time adjusting to his life threating situation. The neat and desert atmosphere are draining his body of water, @CAPS1 he needs to keep pedaling on. Also, the terrain is stripped of water, so he doesn't have anything to refuel with.

7366	3	"The settings affect the cyclist in many ways on the way to Yosemite. Well for one when he took the shortcut, one thing that already made it difficult was that it was June, and he’s out in the desert. Also it says how he went to a couple towns that were deserted so there was no way to replenish his water. It says, “I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn’t cool down. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” @CAPS1 thing about his setting that changed was the hills.  But once he came to a bait shop, the old man asks  him if he  knows the best way to get to Yosemite, and he responds, “yes- sir: I own a very good map.” @CAPS2 by this he’s understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because he’ll know what to expect. This is how the setting changed."	3	2		3																					
7367	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of the ways are that it is affecting him is that the discription of it makes it seem hotter then what it really is. He says “neihbor hood of two hundred degrees.” He is saying that it is really hot. The features of the setting affected him because I mad it seem hoter and he was taking it to far.	1	1		1																					
7374	3	"The wether can change the corse of action a cyclist will take. If it is cold out side then the cyclist will bring beveyer cloths if its. Hoter out side he would most likly bring lighter clothes. If he was riding farther hed bring more supplys like water and food If he was going on a short rid then he wouldn’t bring so much stuff. The way the wether is changes the way a person will prepaire,"	1	1		1																					
7379	3	"The setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist. These settings discourage him, although he tries to keep hope. Seeing dry desert, hills begin to heighten, nothing man-made is in sight. These subconsciously affect the cyclist and his growth of thirst. To one point the cyclists original objective became invalidated for his thirst pangs and exhaustion."	1	2		2																					
7382	3	"The feateres of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example ""not two mlles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changin. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills. ""This affected the cyclist because he had to pedal  harder to go up the hills and he got short of breath due to this. Another example  is, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a rediculously large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” This affected the cyclist because he had to wait for the snake to move so it didnt bite him while he crossed it. One last example is, ""As I stumbled into a rather modem bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1 and Wilber” This had an affect on the cyclist because he was now hapy to have water and have reached his destination."	2	2		2																					
7384	3	"Each area the author entered changed what he felt and experienced. At first, he is lent courage by his surroundings. When he passes through the first town, abandoned and empty, he is still confidant he can go on sparred by the lush green trees and the cool rivers around him that belied the hot sun overhead. They are basically the reason he continued to go on. Later on during his trek through the desolated empty desert, his bleak surroundings make him feel hopelessness as well as despair. Even in the small details, such as the ghost town or the pump, this is ploven, as the ghost town brings him the first vestige of despair, and the useless pump only amplifys it. The scenario and scenery reflect and alter the authors mood throughout the story."	1	1		1																					
7388	3	"Many things that the author talks about in the story affect him: One example in the oldmen that give him advice. They tell him that they know a great shortcut which turns into the authors hardest ride ever. Another example is: the heat, the location, time of day, and time of the year. In California, in @DATE1 in the dessert will give you lots of heat. In order to beat this heat you need lots of water which is one of his biggest problems. He runs out of water. Another hindering thing he discovers is the abandoned welches grape juice building where he sees a picture of a boy drinking a refreshing glass of grape juice. All these combined gave the author a hard time but in the end he found a bait and tackle shop where he was saved"	2	2		2																					
7392	3	"The features the cyclist experianced during his ride affect his body and mind. At first the cyclist was on flat graund, drinking plenty of water and without fear. But when he came to his second town, he became ton on water. This troubled him, but he was optomistic telling himself “the next town was only eighteen miles.” After this the road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” this started to trouble him. Dehydration started to set him and every hill was a challenge. Once out of water he sucked on pebbles and hopped it would “take your mind off of thirst.” When he finally made it, he was so relieved. Everything from dehydration, wich affects the body to lozing hope affected the cyclist on his ride"	3	2		3																					
7394	3	The setting of the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed posted speed limit” affected the cyclest greatly. He was riding through a desert in June.

So the features really affect him.	1	1		1																					
7397	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist. The setting was a desert in California making it VERY hot outside. The hills were hard to climb and there were dangers all around such as poisonous snakes. Not just this was terrain hard to move around on but the path was thickest. “@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” This made it harder for the cyclist to reach his destination.	2	1		2

He is trying to get water but when he tried the pump, “a tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees”.

As he came to the next town, he found, “the building - abandoned years earlier, had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant”. He is still thinking of getting to the next town to get something to drink. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	2	1		2																					
7404	3	"In the story there were many features of the setting tha affected the cyclist. One that had the greatest impact was that it was dry and hot, and that the terrain was very rough in the desert. Being that it was dry and hot made his ride hard. For example, the heat caused him to get dehydrated on his journey and begin to feel signs of heatstroke. The terrain caused an even bigger dilema.

7412	3	The first town the cyclist came to was like a ghost town because there was nobody was there. The next town wasn’t any better because it was @NUM1 miles down the road.

7413	3	"The features of the setting in “DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” affect the cyclist in a negative way. The terrain goes from being very mild to rough and rolling. Considering that the author does not know the layout of this terrain very well, he begins to struggle. The author is very unsure of where to go and begins encountering obstacles such as, tumbleweed, snakes and lack of water. The fact that the author is running out of water, makes continuing on a very stressful. He is worried that he will die of dehydration before he ever reaches Yosemite National Park. Finally, with much strength and determination, he reaches a fish a Fish camp. He is able to fill his water supply and regain his strength before pressing on."	3	2		3																					
7420	3	"The setting affected the cyclist because the terrain you ride on can determine how you ride. For instance when you have hills and dry weather like they did when it said “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” The one easy terrain was now made more difficult and only added to his frustration and his dehydration from having no water. Also the heat contributed plenty and it was there the whole time.  Sometimes he didn’t seem to notice or feel it but it was there and it was taking energy from him: Like when it said, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” He didn’t know it but that took from him so he drank more water and that affected his ability to take enough to complete the ride."	3	3		3																					
7422	3	My point of view that affect a cyclist that people need to recycle sometimes people is throwing away trash can with soda in side of it people cyclist now in days some times they need to change that role my conclusion people need to save stuff to make some new things to make a good quality world of cyclist things.	0	0		0

7444	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead” a cyclist takes some out of rate information from a couple of old guys as he went along following there directions he found out that there directions were out of rate and at points dangerous. Also the setting didn’t help because he was in a desert with ghost towns and it was very hot it didnt help him believe he was going to make it out alive. For example in the story when he enters the  fork in the road it says he found “several rusty pumps,” and “one ramshackle shed.” This probably didnt help him because he didn’t have alot of water left and it was really hot and he was losing confidence in himslef that he went get out and there were rusty pumps so he couldn’t get any water that was good. Also in the story it says that “There was no one in sight, not a bulding, car, or structure of any kind” and that setting affected him because in this part in the story he has cycled for a while and he has no water left and he is getting very exhausted a almost has no energy. Also it decreased his hopes because it says there wasnt a building, or a car anything so it was pretty, much a empty dessert that he was stuck in and he thought he wouldn’t setent of the dessert alive. In conclusion in the story “Rough road ahead” the setting in the story didn’t help the cyclist in his hope or confiendce of setting out because the setting was very abanded and also it was very hot and it didn’t help that he was in a desert."	3	3		3																					
7448	3	In this story the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. He tries to get directions but the people he asked really didnt know what they were talking about. Thats why you have to be careful on who you ask. Then he needs a drink but that dosent work out to well because the water ends up tasting like battery acid. Then the cyclist begins to be on his way again and finds same difficulty in the road. The same difficulty in the road. The road is in bad condition and must do slower then the speed limit. At this point it felt like he was gonna die. Lucky he found a bathroom and drank from the sink.	2	2		2

7467	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month.There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or dreck for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the affect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cowskull, as in movies. Deserts are in intimidiating, they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water thought of death how he was, ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean"" running through his now-teriffied head. Had he been in a city or in rolling farmland he might not have been as terrified. There are people in those places, and places to be safe there, but, in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair. Setting does a lot to influence stories, so it is important to keep that in mind when reading. "	3	2		3

7543	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. first of these is the blazing heat. He is basically in a desert and he is running low on water. As he starts to run out of water he starts conserving it which is dehydrating him so he is becoming weaker, “I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Next up is the rough terrain. When you hit rough terrain on a bike it can get hard to keep going and the cyclist was already short on water “a large highway sign jumped out at me. I read: rough road ahad: Do not exceed posted speed limit sometimes life can be so cruel“. Finally is the structure First there was the Ghost town with the “battery acid” tasting water. Also there was the Welch’s grape Juice factory and bottling plant which were both probably dimeriling. “A sandblusted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.

When traveling through a desert, one must maintain a constant water supply and know their path with respect to the power of nature in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, cycler Joe Kurmaskie must overcome the desert’s heat and lack of water to survive. As the author observes in paragraph @NUM1, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, I could drop from heatstroke.” If the human body overheats, it becomes sick and unable to properly function. When in the desert one must keep cool or perish. In @NUM2, Kurmaskie begins to realize the danger of running out of water in the desert, “ I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. “As this water starts to run out, Joe suffers from dehydration, despair, and a loss of balance.

Also, the beating sun affected him in a different way.

For this cyclist one of the biggest problems is the heat. He says” i was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”. this shows that it is quite hot outside by the month stated. June is quite a hot month especially in @CAPS1 deserts. The second problem is the cyclist lack of water. He says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink some water. When he reaches the end, however he finds water. The third problem is when he needs water, he can’t find anywhere due to the lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find “towns” nearby. Once he finds them, they are either “ghost towns” or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the @CAPS2. He says “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake… blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS2 is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all.

He’s also a little bit angry and disappointed of the old men’s directions. He’s really going a lot more miles then he should be according to the directionsand he's beginning to wonder if they’ve lost it. "	2	2		2																					
7583	3	"As the setting changes in the story, so does the cyclist’s narrator’s mood. His mood changes from happy and confident to indifferent and scared. At first the cyclist is so happy about Yosemite that he is just care free and no worries at all. He says that, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” Even at his first “ghost town” he just “chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on”. After this point he could not be so care free. After this town he came to, “One ramshackle shed, several thirsty pumps, and men”. He said, “this was troubling”, it was very hot and he had been drinking his water pretty often. He said that, “He failed on."" He started to get sort of scared he realized that he could, ""drop from a heatstroke."" He was scared that because of his idea to believe the old men he might possibly die. He finally get happy when he reaches the bait shop and he got his drink. From then on the stock to his map. His attitude changed greatly throughout the story."	3	2		3																					
7586	3	"The features of the setting did not help the cyclist on his trip. First of all he was in the desert on a bike! Which helped him dehydrate faster. Secondly, the ‘towns’ around the way  had been abandoned, leaving no place to get more water and no place to ask for directions. Lastly there were no other people around so if the cyclist was to get into trouble, he wouldn't be able to find help. "	2	1		2																					
7591	3	"In the story, “Do not exceed postal speed limit,” many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First and most importantly, he is affected by the people who live there. “Never accept travel advice from a group of old- timers who haven’t left the confines of their porch since Carter was in office.” This quote describes the feelings the cyclist has towards the old men. Because he listened to their directions, he traveled through ghost towns and hourly died from dehydration. Also, the lack of people and civilization affected the author. There was no one around that he could ask for help from. “…but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. Here, the author is trying to stop for water, but since no one lives in the town any more, he gets none. Finally, the lack of water has a huge effect on the cyclist. “That smoky blues tune “Summer time” rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.” This describes how the author is really dehydrated and he feels like his brain is drying up. However, his need for water makes him more determined than ever to keep going until he reaches another town, or this goal destination of reaching Yosemite National Park."	3	3		3																					
7592	3	"The features of the setting affect the man in many ways. One way is that when the man notices the terrain starting to change, he becomes more and more distrought. He  sees the sign that sats “ Rough road ahead: Do not exceed pasted speed limit” it is almost as if he thinks the sign is mocking him. Also, when the rider says “ In an @CAPS1 twist that should please all sadists…” he is telling the reader that this situation is very ironic and that he was expecting nothing."	1	1		1																					
7599	3	"The features of the environmental setting is affecting the cyclist. A setting is a certain time and place an event is taking place along with the setting their are features, which is the background description basically giving away additional information about the subject or idea. The features along with the setting are intefering with the cyclist by the hot temperature in Lodi, California making the cyclist or biker hotter than usualier as he heads in the wrong direction closer and nearer to the hot blazen scroaching desert. In addition to this he is running out of water and is beginning to get more and more exhausted from the heat plus he is starting to lose consciousness along with getting dehydrated. This is a major problem for the character because he is losing his sense of direction and because of this he is getting more panickly as his supply of water is running extremely low. A instance of the environmental setting affecting the cyclist is “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweet circled my skirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heartstroke on a gorgeous in June ""(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1)."" @CAPS1 example is “This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June “(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM2)”. The hotness and heat had also increased the character’s confidence in himself as he was getting more and more panickly. A instance of this is “I began breaking the ride down into distances. I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it this far, I’d be fine “(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1). In conclusion, the hot setting in California had affected the cyclist in a number of ways it had exhasted his water supply and this caused him to become exhausted, dehydrated, and making him lose his logically sense to make decisions however his loss of sense of direction also gave him more self confidence as he stirved to the roads and serves town that was about twenty miles away in order to get water so that he @MONTH1 survive."	3	3		3																					
7600	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie in many ways. One way the setting affected the cyclist way when it got hot and the rider was running out of water. another way the cyclist was affected by the setting was when he said he ""could die of heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because of listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. a third way the cyclist was affected was was when he went inside the bait shop and cooled down. lastly when he rehydrated himself in the  so the setting was a main factory to the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe kurmaskie on his way to Yosemite national park."	2	1		2																					
7613	3	"The features of the setting make the cyclist feel hopeless after realizing he is not on a short cut. The cyclist has the ""growing realization that [he] could drop from heatstroke"" as he rides along. Also, the only building he sees for miles ""had been @NUM1 Welch's Grape Juice Factory."" The cyclist is driven deeper into despair and feels that all hope is lost when he sees this building. As he rides on, the song ""'@ORGANIZATION2' rattled aroung in the dry honeycombs of (his) deteriorating brain."" At this point, the cyclist believes his own death to be inevitable. He saysown death to be inevitable. He says “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat” when talking about pebbles he placed in his mouth. Finally, the cyclist reaches a small bait shop, and all hope is returned as he “drank deeply from the sink.” The desert setting, with its lack of water, shelter, and people was the cause of this mans concern and later panic about his own life. The hopelessness of this cyclist is much like the hopelessness of those in the @ORGANIZATION1, who trapped in a blizzard far from civilization, resorted to eating their dead just to survive. While the @PERSON1 @ORGANIZATION1 went to extremes for their survival, their setting caused them to feel the same hopelessness as the cyclist."	3	3		3

But it was very hot. Then he began to get into a hort rolling hills which were taking thier toll on his legs. Then we entered into a rough are where he had to be more careful. The roughness prolly wore him out from all the bumps and bounces.

As the day went on, he felt the heat bearing down on him. He drank all his water, and now he felt desperate. His mood changed with the setting, and he was extremely happy once he reached Gary and @ORGANIZATION1. Also, this cyclist decided to blame the old men for giving him bad directions when he was in trouble, but he thanked them once he realized they were correct."	2	2		2

The strong heat, because the cyclist could bare had a heat stroke. The animals because the snake could have killed the cyclist and these was no one in miles to help. In the story it says, “These was no one in sight, not a bulling, car or structure of any kind,” If the cyclist had needed help then the  cyclist could most likely have died. if I was the cyclist, I probably would have given up by then but I’m glad the cyclist didn`t.

7662	3	"The feature in the short story affect the cyclist because with no towns around there is now water. In the story is says, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This means the cyclist was short on water and needed to find a town soon. Cycling in the desert and up down hills made it harder and hotter. The heart could cause dehydration or a heatstroke because it says, “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” the buildings the cyclist did see were not any help to him because they had no water. Eventually he came to a fishing camp and found water in the sink of the bathroom.

Taking advice from a group of old men, he headed to his first stop. The old men said he would see a town but what he really saw was a sort of ruined ""ghost"" town. Then he came to a fork in the road and was running out of water. He had been riding on flat road when the terrain dramatically changed. It became hilly and very inconsistent. This sudden change in terrain caused him to get more tired, thirsty, and hot. The cyclist then came to a huge hill and, using his last bit of energy, rode down. He was exhausted. All the terrain changes not only changed the cyclist’s physical state, but his mood and determination as well.  "	3	2		3

He thinks the shortcut will be a nice way to relax than to take the original longer way to Yosemite. But the trip he makes changes his mind a lot. In the essay the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him. He says, “The old guys had sworn the next town only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. I would conserve my water…” He did conserve his water but the town was very old and didn’t have any water for him to drink. So throughout the essay the narrator went without water until he got to a factory, got some water to drink, and got new directions. The trip was very different from what he had expected. It was more depressing."	3	3		3																					
7676	3	Many things in the setting affect the cyclist. The first thing that affects him is the heat. The heat is actually what causes the conflict in the story of the cyclist needing water. If the heat was not present in the story than the cyclist would not have such a need for water and he would be able to continue on his ride without fear of dehydration. Another aspect of the setting that affect the cyclist are the rolling hills. These hills also exhaust the cyclist and cause him to need more water. If these hills were gone than the cyclist would have tirerd less quickly making his journey easyer. The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
7683	3	"In  rough raod ahead by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting affected the cyclist. Because he was in the desert of California in June, he water supply was emicated and he came across a ghost town. His hope was dwindling because of this. He found a water pump that produced a tar like substance as a result the desert and the lack of water made him wish he was dead he decided never to take advice from strangers and to trust his map. That is how the feature affected the setting."	2	2		2																					
7686	3	"In the story “Do not exceed posted speed Limit”, the cyclist is trying to get to Yosemite with directions that some codgers, or eccentric old men, gave him. The cyclist, said the old men looked as though they, “haven’t left the confines of their poaches since carter was in office. “  Well, he takes their advice, and he gets lost about @NUM1 along on his journey. While looking forward to the “Cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite”’ he was traveling through a barren desert. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This type of setting could really bring down a cultist’s mood while thinking of Yosemite. It could make him lose all hope of ever finding Yosemite at this rate. If you have a nice setting, it makes the trip worthwhile, and your ending point even better."	1	1		1

2978	2	"Certain materials being removed from libraries such as books, music and magazines, shouldn't be removed from the libraries. It gives people a chance to understand how the real world @CAPS2.     Having certain materials such as books and music definitly should not be removed, because most books and music can show most people how bad the statement in the book @CAPS2 or how bad the lyrics are in a song, and help that person to avoid that type of thing that the book or song @CAPS2 saying to the reader or listener. People should give every type of music at least a try and not always doubt what they hear about what people say about that type of music. I always hear about people saying how bad the band @PERSON1 A.M. @CAPS2, just because in the lyrics it talks about drugs and how much cursing each song has. Really the band @CAPS2 talking about one mans life and how he turns his life from being a drug addict to having the best life someone could ever live. People always doubted him and never gave his music a chance. Another example would be @PERSON1's book, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' for it talks about drug addicts, homeless people, people who have been born with disfigured arms or even someone who lost there legs, and telling how beautiful each and everyone of them really are. His book taught me a few things and made me think different about people. It doesn't matter how they look or how they talk, no matter what, that person @CAPS2 beautiful.     As far as movies and magazines has gone within the last few years, I think that the also shouldn't be taken from libraries. I think @CAPS1 for the same reason of how I feel about the books and music. Of course we see previews of movies and think that they @MONTH1 not be good, but libraries shouldn't keep leave them out. Movies @CAPS2 a great way to learn how to treat others and how to act around other people when you don't know how to act. If you act differently around people that you've never been around before, then you could feel embarassed or maybe even get @CAPS4. Movies can help people learn about the real world by seeing how to do those type of things as we get older. Same goes with the magazines, they also help people see what not to do or to help them understand the consequences of something that shouldn't be done. Knowing what to do from a magazine could possible save your life or perhaps maybe even someone elses life.     I don't understand why some libraries would want to banned certain materials to help people understand the things that happen in someone elses life and to help them not make the same mistakes as that person once did."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
2981	2	"In @DATE1's world, there are many things found offensive.  Everyone has their own opinion on what is offensive and what is not. Many parents are becoming upset because they think their children are viewing things that they should not.  Other people are upset because they think the libraries are offending their culture or way of life.  This is even taken to the extreme where people want censhorship on libraries to avoid this, which is wrong.     Some people are becoming concerned about the materials in libraries.  They find these things to be offensive.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but there really is nothing anyone can do if someone is offended.  The world is a public place and everywhere we go, something might be found offensive.  The library is a place for study.  It is never intended to offend someone, or bring bad to the world.  It is simply a place to inform, and if someone is offended by what they see, they should stay away from the library.     I have been to the library many times, none of which have I ever seen anything offensive.  Everything I have ever witnessed at the library is for learning and research.  There are certain sections in the library.  If a parent does not want their child seeing something, they should keep their child in the children's section.  I can assure you, there is nothing offensive in the children's section, or else the library would not have it in that section.  The owners of these libraries know what is going to upset people and what will not.  If there was truly offensive materials in the library, those materials would be taken out.     Also, if a person complains, and the materials are removed, it could lessen someone else's chance getting the materials they need.  One person could think the material is offensive, but someone else might want to learn more about it.  If one is offended by a certain material, all they simply must do, is not look at it.  The library can be compared to a big computer.  One can basically find anything there.  Asking the library to censor their materials is like asking the internet to censor theirs.  It is a way of learning and researching and it would be almost impossible to censor everything there.     Everyone is going to be offended some point in their life.  If the libraries removed everything that could offend someone, they would have no materials left.  People need to stop being so easily offended and realize the library is not trying to harm anyone.  There does not need to be any censorship in libraries.  It is simply trying to teach people about the world and let them enjoy books, music, movies, or whatever else one might go to the library to find."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
2986	2	"The idea of the removal of 'offensive' material from libraries is understandable. Some believe that this material is not appropriate for anyone to view. However, because we all have different opinions on what is offensive, I believe that books found to be offensive should not be removed from the shelves of the library.      First, I believe that if this policy were to be in effect in libraries, there would not be many books left on the shelf. Offensive is a relative word. What @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be to another. Every has a different opinion on different matters based on their beliefs and life experiences. Many books have things people disagree with, but expressing this is a part of freedom of speech. Therefore, if everyone complained that they found a certain book or movie to be offensive, there would hardly be anything left, as Katherine Paterson said.      The purpose of a library is to provide the people who go to the library a resource. If the sources were censored in such a way, it would be hard to get information. Sometimes, it is beneficial, even, to read an opposing view or side to have more knowledge on a certain topic and see things from a different perspective.      However, some books @MONTH1 not be entirely appropriate to certain people. For example, some material in the library @MONTH1 not be best for small children to read or view. In this case, I do not necessarily feel that they should be removed from the shelves rather than placed in an area these children do not have access to.     Having books, music, movies, or magazines removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive is in my opinion, a ridiculous notion. It hinders expression. People have different opinions about what is offensive to them and it would be very boring if everyone thought the same. If someone finds something particularly offensive, I believe they just should not view it"	4	5		4	4	4	4																		
3008	2	"I absolutely do not think that any book, movie, magazine, music, etc., should be removed from the shelf because they find it offensive.  If we do that, then all the books would be off the shelf.  Sometimes the really good books are when they are offensive, because they are actually telling you what they really believe in.     I remember when I was twelve, the news was saying that a school was taking books off the shelf because it offended one person in the school.  The shocking part was that almost the whole school was reading that book.  Even teachers were reading it.  The school board did not even care though.  I think that was completely handled the wrong way.  They should have talked to the girl and said it was unfair to ask that when everybody reads it.  If it offended her, then she should not read it.     Music is an outlet for many people.  They can express their feelings in a way that is amazing.  Without music, there would not be any fun in the world.  People are alwasy listening to music.  When they are sad, mad, upset, confused, etc.  If people think some kind of music is offensive, then they should not listen to it.     Movies are going to be offensive to at least one thing all the time.  That is what makes a movie: a hero and a vilian.  We want to good guys to win.  The movie makes fun of the bad guys.  Somebody is always going to get hurt.     When I read, watch, or listen to something, I do not think of how offensive it is to me or somebody else.  I think of how the artist feels.  Why they wrote it that certain way.  If I am listening to music, I listen to the beat and the words at first.  Then if I like it, I start singing it.  If I do not like it, then I just change the song.     I hope people do not end up just taking things off the shelf when someone is offended.  We need the different opinions in life.  If we all had the same opinions, we would not be ourselves in anyway.  I do not want to be the same as everybody else.  I love my personality.  I am different and kind of an outcast.  But I am true to myself.  And I respect other people's opinions.  I wish everyone would do the same.  Or at least try to do the same.  Thank you for listening to what I had to say"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3015	2	"Should certain materials be removed from the shelves of the library that are found offensive? @PERSON1 states that we will have no books left of the shelf to read if everyone removes a book they do not approve of. What some people think is the most innocent book, could offend another individual. Different people find different topics offensive. No two people think the same.     Though certain books or magazines @MONTH1 have offensive subjects or materials in them, if they were to be removed, how would we learn? For example, say there was a historical fiction book about racism. The book might show different perspectives of how people lived when racism flourished. Readers could learn from the books how racism affects people, and why it is wrong. Learning about dislikes can make someone more knowledgable on why some people think the way they do. The readers can learn from mistakes made in the past. Books or movies depict how life was years or even centuries ago; morals were different a while ago from what they are now.     If many people were to agree that a certain material is very offensive or not appropriate for adolescents or young children, one option that could be available is only allowing adults to check it out. The library could also put a warning on it if they think the content of the material is too harsh. Another idea could be setting up reviews on a website with a list of each book in the library. Consumers can read the review first and then decide whether to check it out or not.     People have their own opinions and views on materials. A person should learn to be tolerant of materials; others might truely enjoy it. This article might be offensive to those who read it, because they might think things should be more sensored rather than tolerated.  If someone does not like the material, they are not forced to check it out of the library so why cause a fuss over it? One person might find a topic very offensive while that same topic sparks interest in another individual. Each person has different morals so who is to say what should and should not be in a library?"	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
3017	2	"Writing is a way to express one's thoughts and ideas on a page. In this country, an author can write freely about whatever he desires and he is not subject to penalty for doing so. Sometimes reading these works can be enjoyable, other times it can be rather disturbing. However, just because a work is offensive does not mean that it is not worth reading. Books, manuscripts, and other forms of literature should not be taken off the shelves even if they are disturbing or offensive.      The @CAPS1, a book written by @PERSON2, revealed the horrible practices of the meat packing industry. It was offensive to many, and in addition it caused an uprising among @CAPS2 because of its content. However, there is a reason that book is still talked about today. If there had been laws prohibiting him from writing about the horrific things that were taking place in those factories, it is quite possible and actually very likely that the industry wouldn't have been reformed for a long time. Fortunately, @PERSON2 exposed the horrific processes that took place in the industry and the government stepped in and solved the problem. Someone out there hates this book, and hated it from the day it was published. But that doesn't mean he has the right to remove it from the shelves and prevent all others from reading it.     Too often students are forced to read works of fiction and stories that, although they are beneficial for students, do not inform students about the world in which they find themselves. It is important for a student to read @ORGANIZATION1, and the works @PERSON4 and @LOCATION1. However, students must learn and begin to understand the world in which they currently find themselves, the eras of the past, and the circumstances that they will find themselves in for decades to come. They must learn how to become successful in life. They should read works by @PERSON1, such as @CAPS3, which essentially tells the story of success and what seperates the average from the great. Someone out there hates these works, and he should not have the right to ruin the opportunity that these books and short stories could give someone else.     Reading is the best way to learn. In a world of social networking and 'screens' of all types, the importance of reading has been diminished. Students must develop a love of reading, and if everyone who hates a book takes it off the shelves, then, as Paterson said, 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' No book should ever be taken off the shelves. Never"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3018	2	"Dear Newspaper,      I beleive that no book should be taken off the selfs for nay reason. People @MONTH1 not be mature enough for some books, music, magazines, etc., and so the libraries that have a problem with some of the materials then maybe they should put a limit to age on checking out certain things. Libraires keep all types of books and magazines so what would be their reason to take the material off the self? I think that there are different types of people in the world and everyones going to wnat to read something different.        If libraries are going to take the material off the self that people don't like then the material that others like would be gone. For instance,if i were to take the '@CAPS1' series off the selves then all the '@CAPS1' fans would be ferious and upset. But knowing that lots of people like the series, my library isn't going to do that. There is alot of books that parents don't want their children to read, but libraries arn't going to take them off the selfs.     Some parents arn't going to want their children and teenagers to read a romantic, rasy book but thats what other adults enjoy reading. Those books arn't going to go away but if parents have problems with it then maybe they should mention to the library to put an age limit to them. The parents could also check on what their child or teenager is reading. But those books will be in libraries forever and you can't make them go away because you don't want you're chilren to read them.     From experiance, I've read a couple racy books and they are disturbing for me, being an imatture addiunce. But i'm not going to ask for the books to be taken off the self. Some books are very vulger and nasty in the ways they discribe fights or wars or abuse but some people like readinf lititure like that so the libraries will keep them. If peoplehave problems with books then stay away from them and don't read them. Its as simple as that.      In conclusion, I think all books should stay on the shelves because all people have different interest and opinions. If anyone has a problem with a book for being racy or vulgur then they shouldn't ready that book, and if they dont want their childrena and teenagers to read the book either then they should be a parent and not let them. They can't blame the library for books they don't want their kids to read because thats not fair to the people who enjoy those books and like to read them.                              Sincerly, @PERSON1"	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
3025	2	"I belive certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should never be removed from libraries because even if offensive people still have the right to acess that information. I make this opinion by the guidlines our country was built on, freedom of speech and equality for everyone. If we started removing books, movies etc. from out of our libraries for being offensive, where would we draw the line between offensive and not? To remove even one book from a library for offending a certain race or culture, would be the beging of a tornado of books being removed by eveyone who has ever not agreed with what is said about them or about their culture and lifestyles. Now, let's stop and think about what it means for somthing to be offensive in the first place. People are offended by things in out world every day and books and movies in our libraries are probably pretty low down on the offensive totem pole next to say the internet or news I would think, wouldn't you?. Plus, the materials we provide to our libraries with are for people too learn and teach, they arn't made to be offensive or rude and in my experience with libraries being a @NUM1+ year user I have never found anything to be offesive or hurtful to anyone.In my conclusion there are just too many books about to many subjects already written to even begin to go through which ones are offensive or not and too whom. In conclusion to that libraries are a place of leaning and teaching and the information inside is ment to be helpful and constructive not offesive or hurtful and to start removing materials now would eventualy lead to the end of libraries."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3026	2	"Have you ever been offended? Did you lash out, or did you keep an open mind and come try understanding? People are offended by many things every day in life. So, we should broaden our minds, and see these 'offenses' as a normality.     You're at a party with a bowl full of candy stationed right beside the front door. You walk in and take a piece. Wait, you don't want that piece? What are you going to do with it? Do you take all of the same pieces that you don't like out of the bowl and throw them away, or do you simply drop it back into the bowl and choose a new one? If you throw the candy away, what does that mean for the other party guests? You have narrowed their choices down because of your own selfish opinion. That candy could have been the guest favorite. But, since YOU don't like it, you take away the other guests' privilege to eat that candy. They didn't deserve that, now did they?     If you're searching through books in a library and you come across a book that doesn't interest you or offends you, then put it back and look for a new one. If you're having trouble finding the right book, ask the librarian for suggestions on other topics or books to check out. Go to a new library, even, but don't mess with something that isn't yours. Especially, something as small as a book.     The point of the matter is, if you don't like something then disregard it. The moment the book, and the book alone, starts causing problems is the moment anyone should intervene. But, come on, do you really think a book could cause a problem? If your child is having problems, don't you think you ought to check what's going on with him instead of looking to see if he/she checked out the 'book that we hope none of our children' took off the shelf. This is quite possibly one of the last things I would think of causing a problem, if I even thought of this at all. Opinions can cause a lot of problems. Sometimes, people just need to keep their opinions to themselves, agreed?"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3031	2	"Every library has tons of information on just about everything.  There are tons of books, music, movies, magazines and more that contain this information.  There is even some information that some people might take offence to.  On the other hand, somebody else could be perfectly fine with it.  I think that all libraries should keep all their books on the shelfs, no matter what kind of content they contain, because not everybody takes offence to some contents in books, and it is the same way vice versa.     The subject race might come into play in some books in libraries.  Books have information about people doing things to other people just because of their race.  Some people want books took out of their libraries because of the content that they contain, but really it could be a n important part of history that people need to be educated about.  Some books have words that are very offencive to people because of their skin color, relgion, or ethnic race.  This information that people need to know because thats how people were treated back then and some stuff like that still occurs today.     Libraries have all kinds of information.  I think that all the books at libraries should stay there no matter what they contain.  Even if some content is offensive some people it could still be a important part of history that people need to know"	3	2		3	4	3	4																		
3034	2	"Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 quote is reflecting people wanting to rid of some of the literature, books, magazines, music, and movies in libraries, because they think that the material is inappropriate.  If we got rid of all of the books from @CAPS1 world, we would have nothing left to learn from, and some of the main sources of entertainment would vanish. I believe that certain materials should not be replaced from the shelves, because the youth of today need to learn about the true past, people should learn about how cultures really are, authors and writers need to be able to express themselves, and parents should be able to control what they believe their children should and should not read.       If it were not for books and novels from the past, the current generations would have no clue of what history was about.  Children should be allowed to read books such as @ORGANIZATION1, The @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in order to get a taste of how much times have changed.  Stories from grandparents only take a person back about @NUM1 years; we need sources that can take us back thousands of years.  Some families, such as an @CAPS6 @CAPS7 family, might get offended if their children are reading books that say things like 'nigger,' but that is our history.  It is something we cannot change, and it is important for kids to know how things really were and how terrible people were treated.  We also do not want today's youth making some of the terrible mistakes generations in the past made, so they need to be taught about the real but sometimes horrendous situations.     Learning about different cultures would be another issue if books and movies were depleted.  Money is not available these days to just travel to different countries and experience their culture.  How is a young girl from a small town in @LOCATION2 supposed to find out how people in @LOCATION1 live their life?  For all she knows, the people could be living in igloos.  I believe that it is important for people to understand different cultures and religions in order to accept them in society.  Movies can teach a lot about different countries, and books do a wonderful job as well.  If they are gone, cultures would be misunderstood and forgotten.     Also, authors and directors need to be able to express themselves.  Every since people are young, they are taught that it is important to be unique and express their own style.  Not every writer is going to want to write about butterflies and rainbows.  There are people that love writing about violence, gore, and segregation.  Those things are part of the world today and everyone needs to face that reality.  Getting rid of all of those books from library shelves will not solve the problems; it would only cause people to not expect what might happen to them or @CAPS1 world.       Now, some parents @MONTH1 have hard times when their young boy comes home from school with an offensive book, but parents should have control over their kids.  If they have a problem with what their children are reading, then they should deal with that personally.  They do not need to influence other people's lives by trying to get rid of the materials off of public libraries' shelves.     Why people would even consider getting rid of history and learning materials about cultures and different subjects in @CAPS1 world is beyond me.  It would be like asking someone to rewind time so that we would not have had slavery, depressions, world wars, and homicides.  It is impossible to undo history, but we can learn about the things from the past in order to not make the same mistakes and things of the current world in order to be accepting and understanding.  Books, magazines, movies, and music are wonderful.  They represent self-expression and freedom of speech, so people should let them be an entertainment and learning source.  Without them, we would be and have nothing"	4	5		4	4	4	4																		
3036	2	"Who cares about unsensored things anyway? Offensive things have been around in libraries, probably since the first library opened. There has been 'offensive' things in a library for as long as i can remember. Now everyone is suppose to share there opinons on pulling these offensive books off the shelve?     What is the differnce between someone saying somthing offense or writing it? Ok, so maybe you dont want your child reading somthing unsensored, but the chances are some other child will say somthing unsensored around him. If there is a book that is so bad you wouldnt want your kids reading, why would it of been published? Publishers do read the books they publish them, they will not publish any random thing. I think that they just need to leave the unsensored things alone. If you cant be mature enough to take a article, book, or magizine seriously, then you dont need to be reading it anyway.                                         In the news or radio you always hear about some boy getting bullied and stuff at school. That isnt because of unsensored things, why dont they blame it on parents and ask where they were at? Parents look at anyone and everyone, but themselves when a kid comes home and has learned a cuss word or somthing. It is never the parents fault.                                             If people pull unsensored things out of the library it will serve no purpose and thats just my opinion. I know that i have no say in it and thats ok i can still believe that i am right. Thank you for your time"	3	3		3	3	4	3																		
3038	2	"Books that are offensive should not be taken off the shelf all together, but should be put in a section made for adult readers only.  This way no children would see the book anyway.       If an offensive book is in a school or any other place that the readers are children for the majority than it should be ok to take that book off of the shelf.     All together it should be ok to remove an offensive book from a shelf but only if the book is offencive to the wrong audience."	2	2		2	3	3	3																		
3043	2	"This is what's wrong with today's society. We are too soft.We're too worried about what other people might think if we say this or do that. I'm the kind of person that doesn't care about other peoples feelings. And I say that to an extent. If we're talking about my friends, family, my girlfriend, that's totally different. I show a lot of respect to those people on a daily basis. But as far as people I don't know, I could care less what their beliefs, opinions, and outlooks on life are. Maybe we should stop worrying about other people for once and just try to grow and prosper as a race.      Anybody ever think of that? If I had it my way, the @ORGANIZATION1 would not exist. @CAPS1, radio, books, movies, magazines would all be uncensored. Is life filtered and censored? Absolutely not! So why should those things be? I'm sick and tired of people constantly sheltering their children from lifes normalcies. They've gotta learn sometime. Life isn't lollipops and rainbows. It's hard, unforgiving, and it kicks you in the teeth. You've just got to learn to adapt to it. And censorship in libraries, on @CAPS1 etc, won't and aren't helping matters in the least bit. I guess I don't understand why we have to care so much. If everybody just relaxed a little and focused on themselves, we would be fine. Everytime I hear the word 'offensive' it makes me sick to my stomach, because in my eyes, that word doesn't exist. It's a made up word that really means we care about other peoples feelings more then we do our own"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3053	2	"Have you ever noticed how much bad materials are out there for childeren to get ahold of?  A movie, book, magazine, music, or even something on @CAPS1?  It would be nice to get rid of all that bad material, but what if someone else doesn't feel the same way about that song, movie, or @CAPS1 show?  I think it would be horrible if we took away all the bad materials because it might bring violence between some people who disagree on it, and it goes against one of our rights, freedom of speech.     In the world we live in today, if you take something away from someone like their favorite book, its going to bring out some violence between some people.  Look back into our history, we are a country full of rebels.  That is how @CAPS3 even came to be.  So take away something from people they are going to stand up and fight for it.  There will always be people trying to smuggle and hide some things, so we will never be able to get rid of it completly.       If you take away all the bad materials it would be taking away one of our rights, freedom of speech.  Some materials out there @MONTH1 be offensive to others, but it's not like we have a right to get rid it.  It's not like there is any book, magazine, or even a song out there that someone doesn't get offended by.  If we do take away all the offensive materials we should take away everything. So what is the point we all will never all agree on something, we can't please everyone.  In taking away all the offensive materials you are taking away people's right to freedom of speech.     Don't try to take away all the offensive materials, it will just bring violence and make it all much worse than it was.  If you're a parent it's not like you can shield your children from everything because eventually they will learn what it all is.  So it won't do any good to try to get rid of it.  It will still be around.  It is just something in our world that we have to live with"	3	3		3	3	4	3																		
3058	2	"All throughout the world there are libraries.  Librairies have all different kinds of materiel stacked upon shelves.  Most of the material is helpful and enjoyable but some is not.  I think libraries should be able to have whatever they want on their shelves.  Yes, i understand some of this material @MONTH1 be inappropriate for a certain person but there is a way you can fix this.     If libraries have inappropriate books, movies, music, ect.  I think they should be able to keep them.  Just because some people do not that material does not mean everyone won't like it.  Everyone has their own style, everyone likes different things and has different opinions.  Isn't that what makes the world go around?       Adults @MONTH1 have a problem with the offensive material because they have children who go to the library.  I understand there concern but there can be a way to stop them from getting to the inappropriate material.  If libraries are going to have this kind of stuff in their libraries i think there should be a blocked off room where kids can't go.  That way the people who like that kind of stuff can still get to it but the children can not.       We go to school for a vast amount of reasons.  Some being; to learn, to get us ready for college, and to be independent.  While we are at school not only are we learing things like math and evolution, but we are also learing whats going on in the world around us.  If you haven't noticed, all that is out there anymore is bullying, cursing songs and horrifying movies.  We, as children and teenagers see and hear about this everyday.  Since we learn and already know about all of this 'offensive' stuff, why not have it in our libraries for other people who want to study it?     There is alot of different kinds of material in libraries.  Some good for kids and teenagers and some inappropriate.  I understand the concern for parents on censorship in public libraries, but there is a way to stop it.  I think as long as its blocked off into a different room, everyone will be fine and it will cause no harm"	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
3060	2	"Certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive for three reason. The first reason being  what maybe offensive to you @MONTH1 not be to someone else. The next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other. The last reason being if we all just removed thing we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is.     The first reason is that what maybe offensive to you @MONTH1 not be to someone else. In this society we live in we shouldn't go base on ones option because everybody has a right to freedom of speech. History show that many different people found different thing to be offensive because some people think that book that haves gays shouldn't be in books, but many feel otherwise.That a good example on how people have different opition.     The next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things. The libraries being a place to study and learn should have a bus load different things even if some take offensive to it. Infact some books teach us that we shouldn't get offfensive because that what one person feels and at long as your got someone who love you it doesn't matter.     The last reason being if we all just removed thing we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is. Books are a way for someone to give there own point of veiw if you dislike it don't take offensive to it and try to removed it from the shelves. The @LOCATION1 has a government where they take everybodys opition. A prime example of this is the state funding schools which is a big issue we shouldn't just removed the school because someone doesn't like it.     In conclusion certain materials shouldn't be removed from shelves if they're found offensive for three reasons. The first reason being if you found something offensive it @MONTH1 not be to someone else. Next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things. The last reason being if we all just removed thing we dislike the world wouldn't be the way it is."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3069	2	"If you walk into a store and see a book you dont like or a magazine you could care less for, should you be able to get rid of it? My answer to that is no you should not. You do not own the libraries books and you do not have any say on what is displayed in any store. You are the viewers and buyers to these suppliers and if you dont like it dont buy it or look.     When I was in the eighth grade I went to @LOCATION2 for a church missions trip. There was alot of cool things there that I saw. This was one of the most popular places in the @LOCATION1. When we wouldn't be working or serving others we would walk around and do some shopping. There is alot of people in this city and it was packed all the time. Now with that being said there was alot of different stores and there are some in my opinion at the time that i thought were very inappropiate for my age level. My whole group walked into a store where we just really didnt belong and we all had no clue this was the kind of store this was. Our actions simply invovled nodding our heads good bye at the cashier and walking out continuing our day of shopping. We did not remove any books, pictures, or even magazines in that store. Reason being is that, that was their store and we had no right to remove anything. After we left there other people walked in that store and liked what they saw if we would have removed those items they wouldnt of got to see what they liked. That would be like someone removing something from a store I like meaning i'd never get to see it and I wouldn't want that.     If you walk in to a store and see something you do not like you shouldn't be able to try and get rid of that object. Whether you want your kids seeing it or not you just cant do it. You take your own risk walking into a store and seeing what they have in store for you.You are there to browse around or buy a few things if you would like too. Every store should have their own certain things and what you find offensive other people might like. That goes for the opposite too what other people find offensive you might like. It is all a big chain with many loops.      So say you do take that piece of material off that shelf or off the display. Now that material is gone all because of you thought it was offensive. Say another person walks in the ame store and takes something off the shelve that they thought was offensive. Now there is two things gone from the shelve, but you actually liked what they took off the shelve and your upset that they took that off. This will cause alot of conflict and big situations in the future if this was allowed. One person likes it one person doesnt. If you dont like what you see in a store then you shouldn't walk in or you should simply ignore the stuff that is offensive to you.     These are some of my opinions about this catagory. I believe you shouldn't be able to take stuff off shelves and terminate other stores products. Always be aware of what your getting your self into and know the outcome of the decisions you make. This could cause alot of lossed jobs and many conflicts between shoppers and viewers like you. I hope you take this into consideration and understand my reasonings for what I have said"	4	3		4	3	3	3																		
3076	2	"Yes, I believe that libraries should remove certain materials from the book shelves if they are found offensive to someone. First of all a oerson doesn't go to the library to get offended. Also if the liberian should know whats appropiate for the library. And items like the ones who offend people should not even be in a public area.     A person does't go to the library to see something that offends them. People go to the library to read, study and to have a quiet time. And the people that go to use the library for a resourse, should not find themselves in a situation were they feel that they are being offended by a book, movie or magazine, because of what the autor says in the writeing. People might get offended and stop going to the library.     Also the liberian is incharged of the items he wants to display in his library. If the liberian feel that a book its okay to be displayed he can dispay it, but if the book is offensive to someone else, he should be asked to remove the book. And if the book is resourceful for study the liberian should keep it in an area were people that want the book can ask for it.     Stuff like that should not even be published in a public area. I think that there should be a law that does not allow offencive literature, music, movies etc... In libraries. Now this days people are allowed to donate items of litereature or intertainment to libraries, but i think that people should make sure that the items they are donateing are okay to be displayed.     So yes I believe that offensive materials shoud be removed from the libraries. Because libraries are places were you go to have a quiet time to read and not to get offended. The librarian should be incharged of what he or she wants to dislay. Aand last stuff like that should not even be in a public area"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3079	2	"I think that books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. should be aloud to stay on the shelves of stores and libraries. We have to ask our selves these questions. Why should we take them out of libraries? What would people have to read when those books tell us about what went on in the early days, such as slavery, automobiles, and etc.? Who wants to sit and read about other stuff that is just down right boring?     Why should we take down the books in the library? We shouldn't take the books down off the shelves. We @MONTH1 have the right to take down the books but why should we. It is taking away the knowledge for our children. We would be taking away a lot of stuff the our children should know about, such as the slavery, and famous people.     What would we have to read about if we took most of the books out of the library? We would have nothing to read about other then the stuff that doesn't matter to us anymore. You have to think about if we took all of the books that were inappropraite off the shelves of the library there wouldn't be anymore books. Every book out there has something bad in it, so we would have to take away all the books other than the little kids books.      Who would want to go to the library and want to sit there knowing that they are going to be reading something that is not interesting and just boring? I can tell u who wants to do that. Nobody,'' it's just dumb to do it and has no point, unless you are old, then you @MONTH1 like to, but not everybody is old. Reading is fun to some kids and they want to read about different stuff, but if we take the books they can't.      We don't need to take any books out of the libraries? There would be no reason to go to the library or even read books, cause there isn't any good ones. We are just taking away something that is really big to us @CAPS1, and without those books there is no history for us to study. Our kids need to see those books even if we don't want them to. That is the early days and they need to know about all of it and how it was back then when they didn't have everything we do now. You can't take away something that is fun to do so why take them"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3080	2	"I've recently read a letter from Katherine Paterson about censorship in libraries. This is my opinion expressed in words about how I feel about the whole topic.     I've been reading ever since I hit first grade. To be honest, I couldn't tell you the names of @PERCENT1 of them because... well I just can't remember them. I'd like to think that it's because I have a horrible memory, but the truth is, they were just unappealing and unmemorable books. In all aspects, these books could be considered a waste of my life. Back then, I guess I only read them because I had nothing better to do, which is horrible because you should read books because you want to. I stopped reading books at around seventh grade because every book I picked up seemed to be extremely boring and it would take the first one hundred pages to actually have something decent happen.          Luckily, there is light at the end of this tunnel. Every now and then you come across a book that changes your life. Not literally, but it feels that way at the time (which is what you should feel). These are the books I remember. These 'life-changing' books all have things in them that would interest anyone who picks them up. Unfortunately, these things would be viewed as innappropriate to a select audience. For example, one book @MONTH1 talk about murder and be viewed as highly offensive by a person whose mother had been murdered, whereas the same book could be viewed as a piece of art by someone who has escaped the terribleness of death. Apparently it has gotten to the point where people would have the books censored or have them removed the libraries completely. I can stand idle no longer.     Books all go through a long, drawn-out process before they are shelf-ready. They need to be written, read, and selected to be published. For some books, this can take years. To completely alienate these books is extremely unfair to the time that was put into them. If you don't like the books, don't read them. It's as simple as that. If that's not enough reason for you, think of it this way: a book about a child getting raped and fighting to overcome it could serve as inspiration for rape victims. Or, a book about someone's parents dying could help a child in the same situation overcome the grief.     All books serve a purpose and should remain staunch on the shelves of local book stores, regardless of the methods used in them. Even if they don't appeal to you, it could be a completely different experience for someone else halfway across the world. Let these books serve their purpose."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3085	2	"I beleive that certian things such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., should and shouldn't be taken off of the shelf. The reason i think that  they should stay on the shelf is because it might interest some of the people that read them. If people don't like them, or they think that it is offensive, they shouldn't go to that library.     I don't get offended by anything. When I am going through the library I have seen people get offended by some of the  things that they have on the shelfs. Reading things and them getting offensive is a totally different thing. People that read things and get offended by it, should have a say in whether it is on the shelf or not.     The reason I think that some of the things shouldn't be on the shelf is because it might be inappropriete. It might not be good for the eyes of people.

3086	2	"Yes, I think that some books should be taken out of all libraries. No little kid should be looking at or saying those things. Some of the books could offend some people when they don't know it.      Parents need to watch what there kids read and watch on a daily basis. Kids need to know why they shouldn't watch those shows or read those books. Maybe if parents would watch there kids they would mind better than what they do.      Some of the books could offend people when they don't know it. No little kid should be looking at or reading those books or movies. That is why i think those books should be taken out of all libraries"	2	3		2	3	3	3																		
3089	2	"We've all heard the songs on the radio that are censored by constant beeps because of bad words, and we've all seen  @ORGANIZATION1 shows and movies that are the same way.  Books and magazines are censored the same way by either blocking out the offensive language or replacing the letters with astrics.  Numerous amounts of people see no harm in this and support it, while others think that it is no big deal because, eventually, people are going to end up seeing the bad things anyway.      If you were an author, musician, or director, wouldn't you want your work to be seen and published as you had originally written it?  Most of those people would, and get angry when their work is edited.  They want their work to be heard, and sometimes editing out the disrespectful things cause the message not to be understood as clear as it would be with those certain words.  This can also cause the original message to be completely missed, and the work could end up meaning something totally different then what it was originally supposed to mean.      However, another question arises: If you were a parent, would you want your kids to see those inappropriate scenes in movies, or hear harsh words in music?  Most would not want that at all and strongly encourage editing out things that their children are too young to hear and understand.  Eventually, though, kids are going to be faced with those things.      In conclusion, cenorship should just be ignored.  Children are going to end up hearing bad words, seeing inappropriate things, and reading offensive passages in books or magazines.  Censoring things can mess up the original message being brought to attention and anger many authors and musicians.  There are loads of harsh things in the world, its impossible to just edit them all out"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3093	2	"If I owned or worked at a librarie, I would have books, music, movies and magazines that to many people are offensive. But I would not have the offensive books, music, movies, and magazines in the childrens area of the librarie.But I would have them in the adult area.         @CAPS5 I would keep that type of books, music or movies might you ask? Well because the adult and older tenageers should be able to handle and act like adult when reading the book, watching the movie, listening to music. If the type of book, movie, or music is causing violent behavior around the town then i will completly remove the item from the shelf. Its that simple.           If parents get mad and angree because of these books, movie, and music don't let your children watch, read, or listen to them. Pick out a childs book like @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1, don't pick out a book from @PERSON1. Let your children read a book with lots of pictures and color. Watch @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1 not @CAPS3 on a @CAPS4.         My questions is, '@CAPS5 not let people read and watch something that they want even if it is offensive?' @CAPS6 people love watching the scary and offensive movie or listening to the rap music. People live in defferent worlds even though we all live in one.      In my oppenion offensive books, music and movies should stay in libraries. Just little and younger kids shouls not read, watch or listen to them"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3097	2	"I @CAPS1 would like @CAPS4 if nothing was censored, but I don't matter, right? I am the kid that has no choice in the matter. @CAPS3 should I not care about what I am forced not to see? I am sure there are alot of parents that dont follow the censorship rules. Like buying a rated '@CAPS2' movie, or game for their kid that is @NUM1, and not @NUM2 years old, but @CAPS4 does matter that the parents are following the law. I say shrew the law, because when @CAPS4 comes down to @CAPS4, its the parents right to tell/show there kid about things, not the goverment.      I Think that @CAPS5 have never really had a choice in matters that affects them directly, and I think we should. @CAPS5 have to follow what ever rules untill there @NUM2 years of age: @CAPS3? I wish I knew @CAPS3, but I dont. Because there is no logical reason for @CAPS5 not to have a vote on what affects them.           For all I know there could be a law out right now that is going to make my generation less powerfull then the last generation. I am not saying that this is true, I am only saying that its possible for some thing like this to happen.     Video games, They are my weakness I admit, but I don't see a reason for games to be censored. When people say things like '@CAPS5 who play video games with violence will make them murders.' @CAPS4 makes me frustrated. There is not one single thing that proves that.      I have known @CAPS5 who have been censored all there life, and when they learn about @CAPS4 all they cant even handle @CAPS4. Its sad really to not beable to watch the news and learn what is going on in the world. Just because they have been kept away from all that all there life.     I don't know how or where they get this censorship idea from in the first place. Did their parents tell them @CAPS4 was bad, and never watch/read @CAPS4? Where did they hear @CAPS4 from? I beleive @CAPS4 came from the media @CAPS4 self. I can see the headlines now, '@CAPS5 watching @CAPS6 movie cause them to be murders.' Then they would have some made up percentage on how manny @CAPS5 turn in to a murder that watch @CAPS6 movie compare to @CAPS5 that don't.     What I am really saying is that I try not to let other peoples beleifs get in my head and change my own beleifs. Even by me writing this @MONTH1 have cause someone to change there beleifs, and I really @CAPS1 hope I haven't."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3098	2	"Do I belive that some books, movies, magazines, or ext., shuold be removed do to the fuct some people might find them offensive? NO, I belive that every should have the chance to see it to other then the just the people how did and thought it was offensive. Someone could really like it or a group of people could.Even if some people find an object offensive someone else might need that object for something like school work.     Lets say the libraries remove a human trafficking book from the libraries becuase people find it offensive. Then a local school has a praject on human trafficking. The students go to the libraries to get some books on it. Now do to somebody elses dislike of the books these kids don't get to use those books to do thier reshearch.     It wouldn't be fair to everyone to remove objects from the libraries just cause some other people find it offensive. The libraries is a public place that everyone has the right to go and borrow stuff from. So no i don't belive that libraries should remove books, movies, magazines, or ext., do to the fact that some other people @MONTH1 find them offensive."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3104	2	"The media is destroying our youth! this is something we hear everyday. Teachers are telling us this, while parents and grandparents are telling us how mush different their world used to be. They explain how the media of their time wasn't as open about sex and violence. They go on to say how they didn't have violent video games teaching children that killing is alright. Because of these people, we think that the media is repsonsible for the wrong in the world of @DATE1. The truth is that it isn't the medias fault, it is the parents. It is the parents responsiblity to teach the children of the world the difference between right and wrong. If these such parent do their jobs correctly then the youth of @DATE1 will not need for everything to be censored. It is my firm belief that their should not be any censorships. When their is censorship people can govern what we learn, destroy what goes agiainst their beliefs, and destroy our god given right to freedom of speech    Censorship will detroy the knowlege available @DATE1. We have had seen censorship in our history. When we look back we see that the @ORGANIZATION1's censored and destroyed anything that went against them. We hated it when they had book burnings and destroyed the custums, art, and music that the government felt was wrong for their people. How would we be any different if we did it. We could potentailly be destroying somones way of life. We would be destroying what could possibly be tomorrows masterpeice. In censoring we would be detroying history.By destroying history we would be detroying the brilliance that is learning.     If we allow censorship anything that goes against our own personal beliefs would be destroyed. If you ask any christian if they would allow their children to read the muslim book of faith, the @LOCATION1, they would tell you no. It would be the same if you asked a muslim if they would let their children read the @CAPS1. The point is that if their is cansorship we would be destroying other peoples beliefs. No one has the right to govern what others believe in the world.     Also in censorship we would be exterminating our freedom of speech and the freedom to express ourselves. If we don't allow peole to read what someone else has written because we believe it is wrong, then we are taking away their ability to learn new ideas because everyone has different opinionsand theories. Every newspaper would shut down because they would all be saying the same thing. No one would want to read them because they would already know what they would hav eto say. When we start giving up rights such as freedom of speech we will not be able to stop those people who took those right from taking more.      Of course their will always be things in the media, in books, and in music that we don't like.Their will be cursing, nudity, and violence everywhere we turn. This is not because we want it there, but because these things are a part of life. They are the dark parts that we dont want to see.  If you dont want to see dont look. Just dont close everyone elses eyes because you dont like what you see.     Our learning, our beliefs, and our freedom of speech are too important to just give up to censorship. We cannot alow others to dictate, in this matter, what is right for us. Our media is too intertwined with our lives. Who's right is it to decide what is right for our lives. If we start giving up these small freedoms then those taking them from us will not stop. They will just keep taking what freedoms we have until we are nothing more that a dictatorship"	5	5		5	4	3	4																		
3111	2	"The right to remove a book off of a shelf is not good thing to do. My view on the subject is that, if this begins there will only empty shelfs in librarys across the country. Once the removing of books start there will be hardly any left.     We use books everyday, for students we use them to learn and for a entertainment during someclasses. Books help us learn things, like new words we've never heard of before, or some major point in history we should know about. Even as adults some of them like to read in there free time.     I think its wrong to remove a book off of the shelf, just because a few or a bunch of people think its inaproprate. If it is the librarys should have section for those books that dont let the little kids go in that section. their is a problem for this idea, what books should go into this section of the library? A way to solve that question would be to elect a nation wide library service to set it up and have people vote on which books to to remove or put into a speacial section in the librarys across the nation. This idea goes the same for everything found at a library.     Another soulution to this matter is that, the librarys across the nation have another labeling system like the dewey decimal system but use both. this new system could contain information like reviews from crtics about the book, or what happend during the book. This would inform the reader more on what he is about to engrossed in for the next week or so.     The books, music, magazines found in librarys should be left their for a reason. Sombody wrote, or composed for a reason. so people like you and me can enjoy good stories in books and read informing magazines ad listen to good music"	3	4		3	3	3	3

All people from littler children to adult can still learn now today in the @NUM1 centrey . You can learn about your ancienty or about car crash or about or thing that are going on it the world .

3136	2	"Have you ever watched or seen a book or even a movie that you do not think kids should be reading or watching? I have, heard of many books. There are even music out there that only adults should be listening too. There are some parents that are strick on what their kids watch, hear, read or sing. I know for a fact that my parents would not want me to be letting my childern read, watch or hear that kind of stuff.      When you think of the music, books, or movies that need to be out of childern reach what should they be? I think the movies, books and even music that have bad language, violence, and bullying need to be hidden from childern. Bad language is not apporaite from kids to be hearing when they are under the age of ten or even older. When you hear a bad song coming on when you have little kids near you, you should turn the station to a differnet station. If little kids hear this kind of language they well be saying it when the are young.     Another book, song or music that should be taken off the shelf should be ones that have violence. If kids watch, hear or read about violence, they are most likely to start being violent when they start hearing or reading about it. When you are walking around you, you should not be scared to walk by yourself with out getting attacked. If you see someone reading or watcing something that you do not think is right for them you should tell them not to be reading or watching that. Violence is bad for little kids to be doing when they are young.     Books, movies or music about bullying should be taken out of. Bullying is not the answer to everything, even though many think it is it is not. If you think it is good for little kids to be learning about bullying you are wrong! It is a bad thing for little kids. Bullying also gets you in trouble when you are caught doing the bullying.      Have you ever thought of a book that should be taken off the shelf? The books that I think that should be taken off the shelf would be the ones that have bad language, violence, and bullying. Childern should not be hearing or reading about bad language. They also should not be watcing anything about violence. Lastly they should not be reading anything about bullying"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3139	2	"Honestly there's alot of books and magagives that need to be taking off the self. I can remember in the sixth grade going to the schools library and picking up a book that not only told me wha weed was it told me how to grow it! Also alot of book refer to drug and sex now a days and  absolutly hate it! The last book I checked out, even though it is been a while sence ive checked one out, had enough referances to sex that i could honestly say I thought I was read a porn magazine.     Our schools really need to watch what they put onto there selfs. I mean come on sixth graders shouldnt even be able know what weed is! Let alone read about it in school! maybe that why kids get interested in drugs and achole at such an early age. The book I read didnt have any negative satments about the weed. what makes anyone think that a book like that would keep kids from doing drugs?     Like I said before alot of book in schools and pubic librarys have books that refer a lot to drugs and sex. They have books now in our library that tell you what the drugs are, what kind of high it'll give you. And were you can buy the crap to make them!     Ok I know im in highschool but you should have book that seem like pron magazines. The book i read have pictures of postions in it! it broke everything down into details! It even gave websites on the back of the book. And that my friends is not alright. Its just sad.     It is just starting to scare me about what kind of stuff my little brother and little sister could be reading. Doesn't it scare you? I know I dont want my siblings to be reading about drugs and sex in detail. Let alont them reading about it at all. just take the books off the schools and pubic librarys selfs. Hardly anyone will read them anyway. And if they do its by accident like mine incounters where"	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
3145	2	"Censorship in libraries is not necassary. No reading material should be taken off the shelf. Every book has a different experience that can help a child learn. If the gurdain of a child believes that a certain book is bad or offensive; then the gurdian can forbid the child to read it. If people began to take away options on reading materials some kids @MONTH1 refuse to read at all. Every person is different and likes an option to pick a book that they can get in to. Censoring books at a library is pointless, you take away options, and the experience to learn from certain books.     Every book has a different plot and a different moral. Each story in its own way teaches the reader a moral. When you start to remove books from libraries you are taking away the chance for a student to learn a certain moral from that book. You are sort of in a way trying to hide away reality when taking away certain books. No book should ever be taken off the shelves of libraries. Every book removed from the shelves  is another learning experience taken away.     If there is a book that a child's gurdian disapproves of; keep it up to them to forbid their child not to read it. A book is simply a way to learn and explore the different things in life. Censoring at the library can only keep kids away from the books for so long. Every child deserves the chance to read any book they wnat, unless a gurdian forbids. It is not up to libraries wether a book is offensive or bad. That is soley based on the readers opinion, and everyones opinion is different. So again, if a gurdian really wants their child to stay away from certain reading material they can forbid their child by theirselves.     When libraries begin to censor books they take away the option to pick books. When you limit the themes of books in your library, some kids @MONTH1 just pick up less and less books as time goes by. Everyone enjoys a differnet kind of book, leaving options open gives everyone the chance to find a book they like. Although some stories @MONTH1 seem like a bad option, it is not until the reader has begun to read that he or she can figure that out. Leaving options open for students is the best idea, because more kids @MONTH1 actually read.     All in all libraries should not censor books or any kind of reading material. Everyone is different even when it comes to reading a book. People like their options to be open and at a wide range. Each book tells a differnt story and teaches a different moral. So leave the options open to the children and let them learn from the stories they choose. Some books helps teach a moral or get a point acoss. Also some books help prepare a person for the outside world. Taking away certain reading materials is taking away the chance for a child to learn the things that are actually going on around them. In conclusion censorship is a bad idea and should be left to the gurdian of a child"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3147	2	IN MY OPINION I THINK THAT SOME BOOKS PROBABLY SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE SHELVES IF SOME OF THE BOOKS AREW FOUND OFFENSIVE. SOME OF THE MOVIES AND BOOKS PEOPLE FIND OFFENSIVE CAN BE PRETTY BAD AND SAY NASTY THINGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.      SOME MUSIC CAN BE PRETTY OFFENSIVE TOO BECAUSE IT CAN SAY NASTY THINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT NOT ALL MUSIC IS BAD.. IT DEPENDS ON THE KIND OF MUSIC YOU LIKE TO LISTEN TO IF IT SAYS NASTY THINGS BECAUSE THERE IS MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC TO LISTEN TOO.	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
3155	2	The censorship in libraries should be as gog as it is for that age group. Children of the age @NUM1 to @NUM2 should be able to read books with any profanity. they should be mature enough to get through a book that has name calling and uses the profanity without laughing or taking it offensive.     Children that are @NUM3 should not have books in their libraries with much of this pro-found languge. They are young and should not be expecting the fact that there people that use these words to express feeling or name calling. They should be able to hear very little or see very little but when they get older they are suppose to be use to this. If they dont hear it as much then yes i would agree but they should have a point of censorship in the libraries they are in.      With children that are younger than @NUM4 years of age they should not read or seee things that have profanity or bad scenes unless their parents let them. We cannot controll what parents lets their children do but we can in the schools and in the public libraries	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3159	2	"Hi my name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 and I'm here to talk about why I thing we should have these certain materials in the libraries.                       Why I think these materials should stay well because,  For @CAPS3 lets say its a certain movie or song or book or whatever just that one thing you were looking for, for ages and you couldn't find it in any other store and you just happening to go to the library just to look. Even though  you know its not there, but you just looking and you end up finding whatever it is you where looking for.             And what if you wanted to look for a myster book and only the library had that book you where looking for. I can think of alot of reasons why we need certain materials. well i guess that about sums that up for me.                 And in concultion put yourself in the same shoes or even my shoes. What would you do? would you let them remove those materials or would you fight for them to stay."	1	2		1	2	2	2																		
3164	2	"People think that graphic images or words are going to change the outlook there younger child has on alot of topics. But really the kids wont remember half of what they read or see so does it really matter? Well according to some people it does which i can understand but i will have to go with the side that it does'nt matter to. Becasue its not like there not going to find out about bad language or sex so i say there should be no restrictions on books, music, movies, magazines, tv shows, ect.     The fact of the matter is that people or parents get to offended or complain cause there little @PERSON1 said a curse word in front of them. Or becasue some of the material in the show or magazines are to offensive towards people with disabilities, races, ect. When really all of this is just humor none of it is the network or authors being serious. Authors works arent to be shunned apon but to be read and for people to learn from that book or just have a good time reading it.     Through all of this you should know by now that i don't think that books should be taken off the shelf just becasue little kids parents are ashamed of what there kid read. Casue like i already said there are gonna find out about this stuff eventually. So no need getting mad over it. And if we got rid of all the more mature books what  kind of books would all of us more mature kids and people have to read. Casue im pretty sure i dont want to read about a magical friendly dragon finding its way home."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3168	2	"Picture this: you come home one day after work and before you even enter the house, you hear music blaring from your child's room. As you step closer, you begin to hear the lyrics that go with the banging bass and you realize that that isn't just any music, it's completely unedited, expicit versions of vulgar songs. Now, who would want their child listening to songs that make it seem like drinking, doing drugs, and other various risky activities are okay? I know I sure wouldn't.     Music isn't the only source of offensive material in today's society. It can be found nearly anywhere. In books, magazines, @CAPS1 shows, movies, on the @CAPS2, you name it. All of these are easily accessible by children of all ages. That is why there should be censorship of certain materials, to a certain degree. By this, I mean that if there is a dirty book in a public library, it should only be able to be rented by people who are of a certain age. Just because it's bad doesn't mean that it has to completely vanish from the face of the world. There should just be a limitation on who can view it. That applies to everything that could contain offensive material.      Kids are kids. There are certain things that should be absolutely off limits to them--such as explicit movies, books, music, etc.--as they do not need to know about drugs, sex, or alcohol at such a young age. Censorship should definitely be in effect in places like public libraries where young children are bound to be. But, as mentioned earlier, censorship should only be to a certain degree. Keeping childrens' minds clean for as long as possible would be a very positive thing to do for both them and our society in general"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3172	2	"Should books, magazines, movies, and music be put in higher reaches of children, or should they be left in plain sight? Is @CAPS5 fair to not be capable to see a movie, magazine, or even read a book because others in the area believe @CAPS5's offensive in their view? If an adult is reading a specific book or magazine and they feel @CAPS5's only for their eyes to see @CAPS5 then they should keep that item in a personal place that only he or she knows, not anyone else.      Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. The reason for this is because, @CAPS5's not fair to others who haven't read them, and who would like to read them, but can't because they have been removed to others oppinions. If the books and magazines weren't appropriate for children then the companies wouldn't print them and releasr them to stands for them to be sold. If certain music also wasn't appropriate then music producers wouldn't let artists release that song out on a track.     There are many chances for school projects that @MONTH1 require getting information, but the student who is assigned to get @CAPS5 is not able to, due to the fact that adults think the website @MONTH1 be inappropriate. For example, in history class a student is assigned an assignment to get done over the @DATE2 about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for a grade. @DATE3 comes and he/she doesn't have @CAPS5 and gets a @CAPS4 for the homework he/she was assigned. The student explains why he/she wasn't able to get any information. He/she starts explaing themself by saying 'the websites I went to were blocked. The books and magazines I tried checking out were either thrown out, or I wasn't able to check them out.' '@CAPS5's all because our neighbors who live in this neighborhood think the pictures and words are offensive, and since then the librarians stopped putting them out on shelves.'      The teacher then says, 'well then I will go and sign out a book for you and you can try and get as much information out as you can, how does that sound to you?' '@CAPS6 good, at least @CAPS5's better then getting an @CAPS4 on the assignment,' said the student. @DATE1 @TIME1 comes, adn the student has as much information he/she was able to get out of the two books, and hands @CAPS5 to the teacher. At the end of class @CAPS5 gets graded and the grade on @CAPS5 turns out to be a @CAPS8. Student is happy for picking up the grade but is still unhappy he/she wasn't able to get the items they needed from the start.     This is why movies, books, magazines, or even music should not be removed from shelves. Things like this will probably happen, and the kids will land up getting in trouble for not having the assignment turned in which is not even their fault. If only a few citizens have oppinions about certain items and they feel that those items should be removed, then they should be from their sight, and they shouldn't bother thinking of them. Even if @CAPS5's for safety of the children they @MONTH1 have in the house with them, then they shouldn't even have the books out of the little private personal spot where nobody knows of excpet for that one particular person."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3179	2	"Do you believe that certian materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, no i do not. it is one thing to censor a book or movie, but to completley remove it is another. I feel like authors, artists, musicians, and writers should have the freedom to write and say what they want. Regardless of who is reading it.     I feel like censorship is wrong. Authors should be able to feel free to express there thoughts and feelings about a subject or topic in any way they like. some times storys cannot be explained or told the way it needs to be without certain words. Wether those words be good or bad i feel like with out them the book that is being read is not all of what it could of been. in my oppionion censorship takes away from certain values or qualitys the book could of had with the original context still in it. and to me that is not fair. its not fair to the author. and is most certainly not fair to the reader who is reading the book.     I know from my personal expierences with reading books that 'yes' i have read books that have had bad language in them. but just because a book has one or two bad words in it does not mean that it should be completley taken off the shelf. For example the book '@CAPS1' @CAPS2: @PERSON1 was an amazing book. I probably enjoyed that book more than i have any other book that i have ever read in my entire life. But that book would not be nearly as good as it was with it being scensored or taken off the shelf for that matter.     All i am trying to get at is that good books with bad language should not be censored just because of some of the words it has in it. because that is getting away from what the over all message is about. Your almost taking the words out of context when you do this. Do i believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? No i do not. Neither should you"	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
3180	2	"Sexual conduct, language, and criminal behavior are three big things in my school, and community. Certain books, movies, music, and magazines are all about those three things. If they are in our libraries, how can teachers and administration keep us from it during school? I think the censorship of some movies, magazines, and especially music should be highly discussed, and more strict.     We do not really have a lot of movies in our school library, but I do know that there are some in the town library. Parents and adults do not want us growing up so fast, and yet they allow sexual, crude language movies to be on the shelves of libraries. If it is such a big deal, I think they need to be removed. I'm a big believer on the fact that if it happens, it is going to happen no matter @CAPS1 precautions are taken. But with that said, we can still take the needed precautions to keep it from kids that are too yound to see them, like under the age of @NUM1. It is not just movies that we have to worry about though.     @ORGANIZATION1 is a magazine that is devoted to giving their readers tips on sex, problems with their sex lives, and the occassional '@CAPS1 to wear this @DATE1!' articles. I will say that I have read this magazine, but it doesn't appeal to my interests. Some kids today though, are very attentive to those subjects. Again, that goes back to the problem of kids growing up too fast. I have noticed in my school alone, that it is a rapidly growing problem. If magazines like this weren't on the shelves for us to see whenever we enter a library, maybe we would not be as keen to the idea. If we were not introduced to it so early, we would not be going behind our parents' backs trying to do it. @ORGANIZATION1, and other magazines like it, needs to be taken off the shelves as soon as possible. Music is a world-wide phenomenon.     Say a child around the age of @NUM2 is listening to the new @CAPS2' @PERSON1 song. He is being introduces to crude language, sexual behavior, and criminal acts in the @NUM3 minute time period it takes to listen to the full song. Seriously, it only takes that long for a child to be introduced, and it is only one song out of the thousands that are out there. This music is able to be accessed on many computers, especially in public, town libraries. We are not allowed to act like that in school, and if we are going to be spending @NUM4 of our childhood/teenage years here, why let us listen to it? If you walk into a library, all you have to do is sign your name, the date, and the time you got there to access a computer. After that, they can not tell you to get off of it, unless you are violating the law or looking up something not age appropriate. Music does not fall into that category. It, too needs to be taken away if the language, sexual conduct, and criminal behavior messages are adult rated.     I, personally, love magazines, movies, and music. They are my three m's and I live by them. But not the ones that are going to get me in trouble, put wrong messages in my head, or cause me (subconciously) do participate in a criminal act. I always allow my mother or father to read books, listen to music, and watch movies with me. If they are not pleased with @CAPS1 it is, I will not do it behind their back. The censorship in libraries needs to be more strict. If it were more strict, it would keep our younger children from growing up to fast and keep teens from participating in criminal acts. The censorship in libraries is an ongoing problem and it needs to be fixed."	3	4		3	4	3	4																		
3201	2	"Censorship in Libraries     @CAPS1 are alot of things on the library shelves that you @MONTH1 be concerned about. You @MONTH1 be wondering why they don't take the bad stuff off the library shelves. On the library shelves it contains books, music, movies, and magazines. Some things are like what pictures it contains, launguage it contains, and what kind of advertising.     Some things I have expierenced is with the launguage it contains. I have seen some books, magazines, music, and movies have are cusswords. Also some @MONTH1 have racism things in it that you don't like. Another thing is that @CAPS1 is some bad persuading such as bad things that you hear or see and you wonder what it would be like to do that stuff.     Also another thing are advertisements. Some things a magazine can contain are about advertising tobacco, such as its good for you to try. Other ads are alcohol ads like a picture of someone with a beer or whiskey in @CAPS1 hand, and we think its cool to try it, but its not. The last thing that is really bad in advertisement is drug advertisement, such as a picture of a drug leaf, or inscents. It is bad to do drugs because it can ruin you whole career in high school and maybe in college.     The last thing are pictures and scenes. In movies, @CAPS1 could be scenes that you don't approve of. In some magazines @CAPS1 can be pictures in which you don't approve in either. So things that I have seen are pictures and scenes in movies and magazines that have innapropiate scenes, and innapropiate pictures.     Some things are like what pictures it contains, launguage it contains, and what kind of advertising @CAPS1 is. On the library shelves it contains books, music, movies, and magazines. You @MONTH1 be wondering why they don't take the bad stuff off the library shelves. @CAPS1 are alot of things on the library shelves that you @MONTH1 be concerned about."	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
3205	2	"Everyone today gets offeneded daily. So to go to a library and see offensive material on the shelfs is no different than the rest of the day. However, there are those minds, which have not been poluted and influenced by these offensive materials, that should have a right to keep thier minds that way.      One solution to the problem could be that we start rating books and magazines like we do for movies. The material rated for adults gets put in one area of the lirary while the lower rated material is put on display for the public. The higher rated can be put in an area that is not seen everyday by the public, and is kept secret thus protecting the uninfluenced minds and the people wanting said material can still have their way.     Another solution might be to just get rid of the censored material. It, in my opinion and experience, corrupts both the mind and soul, and causes man to be things he is not by nature. Men, who have nothing better to do than to sit and read or look at things ment for inside of marrage, often accoplish nothing of great value in their life time. They are thus a hinderence to soceity. But if they can not accsess the material, they then need something to do to fill that time. In which case they can find a good classic to read or maybe pick up that dusty @CAPS1 off the shelf.     This thus leaves the labraries with a choice. They can leave their library the way that they want, they can put the offensive material in a seclueded room, or they can remove definent offensive material and keep soceity on its feet accomplishing great feats for the next generation to odserve. Thus the amount of offending someone goes down and maybe the library attendence goes up."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3209	2	Hi my name is @PERSON1 I have a couple topics that I would       like to talk to you about. I have been hearing alot of people          talking about libraries taking alot of there stuff off the shelves      well I think that that the libraries around the world have alot        of information inside of them and if we started taking                  information out of them then what would be the point in              having them. I think that everything in libraries are very               important and who is to know that everybody wants this to          happen. The one thing that I dont really think that libraries           need in them is movies because like pretty much every movie      has a book that goes with it or is the same thing pretty much.       And lets get on with the whole offensive thing I think everone      should be mature about all the negative stuff people can say         even if it is hurtfull. Though I think that the more people read      about what people are saying about them is the less that              they are goin to care because they are goin to just be so used       to it that they are not even goin to know what they are                talking about. If there was one thing that I could tel the world      it would be dont be offened by what people say to you.	3	2		3	2	2	2																		
3219	2	"I believe that libraries should provide any kind of book, magazine, music, and movies to the public, despite if they are found offensive.  First, to support my position, we need to take into consideration that every person is different, and therefore reads and prefers different types of books and magazines.  The same thing applies for watching movies and listening to music.  Second, what @MONTH1 seem 'offensive' to one person @MONTH1 be perfectly fine for another, so the term 'offensive' is ambiguous in this case.  There is no need for an angry public or strikes.  Finally, I believe that the people have a free choice when choosing the types of books and magazines to be read, the types of movies to be watched, and the types of music to be listened to.  After all, it is for their own benefit, entertainment, and learning.  So, libraries should not have anything offensive removed from thier shelves that are found offensive.     First, we need to take into consideration that every person is different, and therefore prefers different types of materials provided by a library.  For example, one person @MONTH1 like to read philosophical books, and the other @MONTH1 like to read romance comedy books.  If the philosophical books were to be taken off the shelves by the library officials, then the person who likes philosophy will not have anything to read.  Yes, there are magazines available and movies to watch about philosophy, but they are experienced and learned differently than reading  @ORGANIZATION2's book, or @ORGANIZATION3's @CAPS1.  I had an experience similar to this with my friend.  She preferred horror movies, and I historical.  The horror movie she was looking for was not in the library, and later it turned out that the library did not have any kind of horror movie because they weren't popular in that city.  My friend was not happy.  The library had historical movies, but I ended up watching that by myself. So, libraries should not have to take away any sort of material that might be offensive to the public.     Second, the term 'offensive' in this case is ambiguous, meaning that it has multiple meanings.  What @MONTH1 seem 'offensive' to one person @MONTH1 not seem offensive to another.  An example:  a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine cover @MONTH1 be offensive to a child because of the picture and 'adult' words for the child.  However, that same cover @MONTH1 be interesting to a young adult because he @MONTH1 be into surfing, suntanning, or @CAPS2.  Offensive is only used in the first part, but not in the second, and the same material was used.  So, should that magazine be removed? I don't think so.  The solution is for the child to look at @CAPS4 Magazines, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS5 magazines.  The library should provide a section for @ORGANIZATION1 so that they can read appropriate material.     Finally, I believe that the peole have a free choice when choosing the books to read, the type of movies to watch, and the types of music to listen to.  They should be allowed to do this because of their differences and their definition of 'offensive'. People should not be forced to read the same type of book, to watch the same type of movies, or to listen to the same type of music.  They should have a choice of choosing the materials provided by the library which corresponds to their personalities.  After all, the materials they see, read, or listen to is for their own benefit, their own learning, and for their own entertainment.  The main goal is for them to be happy with what the library has to offer.     In conclusion, I belive that libraries should not take off any material from their shelves that are found offensive.  This is due to the different people, the ambiguous term for 'offensive', the for the sake of human flourishment.  Libraries are for studying, learning, and entertainment in a quiet, peaceful place.  They should not discourage people to discontinue learning about the world because that would lead to a bigger and more serious worldwide problem: the lack of education."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3226	2	"Many places show and sell offensive material. It is found almost everywhere. Many people try to shelter their kids from it but the truth is if the kids really want to look at it they are going to find a way. So I do not think all offensive material should be removed from shelves but sometimes things can offend more than one person in which case they @MONTH1 need to be removed.       Take music for example, there @MONTH1 be explicit lyrics in songs but that doesn't make them terrible or make them worth taking off the shelf. Music is everywhere and if someone tells you can't listen to it over a few words then they are going to find a way to listen to it.     Movies @MONTH1 be different. For some you do have to be a certain age and that is because of the offensive material. But still some people go see it anyways knowing that there will be offensive material in there but they go and see it and then complain about how offensive it was. Movies should not be pulled off the shelf because it is your choice if you want to watch it or not and if you choose not to there will always be someone who chooses to watch it.     Books @MONTH1 be the only exception. Many people read books and many do enjoy it but many people do find books offensive. Now with music and movies people know they aren't real its just talk or acting. But some books are written by people with the actual beliefs they write about. which is why some books might be pulled off shelves because if one person believes something it won't be hard to convince somebody else.       There is a big difference between choosing not to look or listen to something than being told you cannot look at something. All the things that show explicit material have some type of warning for it and if you choose to keep reading or listening it is your decision."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3233	2	"Censorship     In a library there are a plethora of books to choose from. Books ranging from children's to difficult adult ones. It's nice to know that you have many options and freedom to pick whatever book you would like to read. Censorship is the censoring of a piece of material so it is not legally or publically available. If a book was censored because of the contents inside it would bring into question other books or media related to it.     I believe that if books, magazines, movies, etc. were censored in a library the material wouldn't have a chance to be exposed to people. Some people write books and songs to express themselves or make money. If a book is taken out of a library other libraries will have to remove it also, and other libraries won't buy it. Some people just wish to get there thoughts out and share their message with other people. Censorship in a way stops the flow of what people learn.      Another part about censorship is where to draw the line on what is offensive enough to be censored. If a book is removed from the library for its contents, people will look into as to why it was removed. It gets people thinking as to what other books are also offensive. The reason why one book is removed could relate to another book and could get that one to be removed also. Since censorship is probably mostly opinion, there is no clear boundary as to what can sit on the shelf and what can't.     With censorship you are only stripping the freedom of press away from people. If a publishing company accepts a piece of media only to have is censored later on, this might mean we need new publishers, or that they are also interested in getting what people have to say out into the world. The boundary for censorship is very opinionated and should not be dictated by a single group. When one book is taken down it only brings other ones into question. Those are my beliefs about censorship in the library"	3	4		3	3	4	3																		
3236	2	"Books, books, and more books. There are so many of these spine bound papers, filled with everything from basic @CAPS1 about life, all the way to stories that capture the minds of faithful readers and take them to far off distant worlds. If we were to take all the books in the world and line them up in a perfect row, we would be able to create a bridge of knowledge and iformation far enough to stretch around the moon twice and back. The problem is, that with all of this @CAPS1 and knowledge, there are young minds that are not yet ready to soak it all up. There is no such thing as bad @CAPS1. There is only people who are not yet ready for the @CAPS1 they are about to obtain. So should these materials that open up doors to new minds sets, and feelings such as books, music, magazines,  and movies be censored? That answer is yes.     First off, there is a certain degree of modesty and curiousity that needs to be kept in children. Children need to have a hunger for knowledge to become great learners, and intellegent minds. If the @CAPS1 given to them does not come in the chronological order of importance in which it needs to, this will poison there minds and twist them in to something they were not yet ready to become.     Secondly, @CAPS1 presented to kids to early can harm them physicaly. Children are born with the instict to repete what they observe. This is a primal instict that humans will forever have, and is essential for living life. So take movies for example. If a child watches movies that involve sexual themes, and actions, this can be very harmful to them physicaly. If a child experiences these things to soon, they will want to simply repete what they saw. Then what is next? The answer to that question is easy. There will be more teen mothers than there are needed.      Lastly, premature @CAPS1 can harm mentaly. Take music for example. Music is an even larger gateway to mental damage then movies are. This is simply a result of bad censorship. Many think that music is not as bad as movies because you can not see anything visually, but they are wrong. Music is even worse because children can picture what ever they want to based on what is being said in the lyrics. There needs to be tougher ristrictions on music. Restrictions such as age for purchase should be raised, That is about the only way that explicit content can be blocked.     In conclusion, there should be better censorship restrictions on certain materials. But I do not beleive that the materials that @MONTH1 be harmful or offensive should be remove as whole. Simply because adults do have the right to view these materials. Libraries around the world need to better there restrictions, even laws to stop poisoning the minds of our young. We people as a whole need to come together to make this happen. After all, the children are the future of our world"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3242	2	"Censorship is a big controversy in modern society due to the fact of so many opinions being conveyed through all the new medias in the modern world. When a person has a veiw they tend to want to share it with the world or defend it againts those who opose their opinion. Some people do not always like what is being said or take offense in the way it is presented, thus causing the government, or any authority, to remove or replace these words, photos, lyrics, or film from a select public, such as children, or the entire public. This is censorship and it has caused many debates over what is acceptable in society's media.     I believe censorship is wrong. It violates the @CAPS1 peoples' rights of free speach. When a person has an opinion, they have the right to voice it anyway they want. The authorities should not be involved in what someone writes, sings, creates, etc., in anyway. Censorship takes away from the integrity and purity of a human's thoughts.     Who is to say what can and can't be said? Do we just let the government tell us what we can say and what is illegal? Do we stop expressing ourselves in the way we desire because it is not appropriate? No. We, as the people, must be free to say what we want in our stories and songs, along with movies and other media. If a person does not like what they see then they can turn away or they have the right to speak out against it in their own way; but they do not have the right to opress. They should write back, convey their message and try to win support, not control.     Censorship is not good for any society. People want to say whatever they want and they have the right to. Censorship is not a solution to discrimation or anger, it is only a fuel. If parents do not like something and do not want their children to experience it then do not take it from them, then they should tell them how it is 'wrong' and give them their opinion and reasons so the child @MONTH1 descide what they believe in on their own. An opinion is every human being's right and it belongs to them, not the authorities."	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
3245	2	I think as long as the book ain't offensive or bad then people should keep reading it. If its offensive I think they shouln't read it at all cause it would not be right to read such a thing. Also I think if there is bad music it should be taken off the shelves. Parents or teachers wouldn't want there kids finding out bad words to say	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
3246	2	"I do in deed believe that certain material should not be in public libraries, or places where young people can see it. Things, such as pornagraphic material should not be out in the open where kids can see it. I think we would all believe the same way when we say that kids do not need to be seeing these things.     I personaly have been in a movie rental shop, and seen some of the movies that my parents would not want me to see. Material such as this should be put away somewhere out of sight, and requested if wanted.     I also have a religious view on all of this. I know that it is a sin to look at the things such as porn and so the people in charge of the shop, or library ought to respect me and my religion. @PERSON1 in the @CAPS1 says that if eating meat causes his brother to stumble than he will not do so. We need to have the same aspect on life. If something causes someone else harm we should not do it.     This is an issue that we face every day, and the reason I am using pornagraphic material is because it is everywhere. If I am standing in the @ORGANIZATION1 check out line I see the people magazines and I find it verry offensive!     I will say though, if you are old enough to live by yourself than you can look at whatever you want. I just find it untollerable to post these materials were viewers who do not want to see them have to see them."	3	3		3	3	4	3																		
3253	2	"If something offensive is found at the library, should it be taken off of the shelves? Some people might look at this question and instantly say yes. Others might not think anything of the item and move along. I disagree with those who believe the item should be remove. Instead, I believe the item should not be removed and stay on the shelves.      As a child, I have always gone to the child's section of the library to find a book. I steared clear of the 'grown-up' area. So if my mother found an offensive item on the shelves she would make sure I didn't see it. I believe if the parent watches what their child sees then they wouldn't worry about them seeing something offensive.      However, let's say that an adult sees this item and feels it should be removed. She/he has the right to remove that item but what if, to someone else, that item was exactly what they were looking for? The world we live in has many offensive things in it that we see everyday, such as newspapers, @CAPS1 programs, billboards, etc., and if someone were to come along and take it all away, we would have nothing left but that one persons interests.      This is why we have a little bit of everything in our libraries. If there is an offensive book or a bad @CAPS2 and someone doesn't like it and feels the need to remove it, that is @CAPS3 but then they aren't thinking of what other people might like. I have always heard the saying, 'If everybody liked the same thing, it would be a boring world.' I find this to be completely true.      If everybody liked the same thing, then let anybody that enters the library remove an offensive item. However, if this happens, authors won't want to keep writing books and singers won't want their @CAPS4 there if they find out someone keeps removing their work. On the same note, people won't want to go to the library if they know they won't find what they want because someone took it down.      I disagree with the ones who feel the item should be removed because to someone that book might be perfect. I believe that the book or magazine or @CAPS2 should stay on the shelf for someone who has the intent to read it. If a person walks by and feels the book is offensive, they need realize that to someone else it might not be and walk away. I am sure people would find my choice of books offensive or bad and would like to remove them from shelves. However, I would stop going to the library if that happened. This is why I feel books should stay where there are"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3259	2	"I dont see any reason why to take books off the shelves. If someone doesnt like a book, then they dont have to read it. Books are ment to entertain or inform people. There are books that talk about black people in a bad manner, but they still need to be out there so that people will know. Libraries are out to make money thats all. Let them make money, they can sell whatever they want.      If I had a library I would sell just about anything i could. people will: watch, listen, read anything. So why not sell it or rent it out. It's a honest way of making money."	2	2		2	2	3	2																		
3260	2	"'@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 I like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and I can not lie, when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waste and a round thing in your face you get sprung.' @CAPS2 song in itself depicts a rather provocative tone towards women and men. While '@CAPS3 a'las what sorrows can be seen over yonder' tells us that love can be found anywhere. Now look closly at both lymrics you will eventually see a connection in both. The rap song @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is about a man that finds love in large glutius maximi while the other says that love can be seen everywhere, and anywhere.     To say that music, magazines, books, and more should be banned is to say that throwing an @CAPS6 flag on the floor is just okay. Well its not; banning books, music, etc. is just like cencoring someones imaginationa and creativity. It is just like the book @DATE1, where @CAPS4 @CAPS8 is watching, and that we are only based on what we are allowed to read, and even think. Taking away movies and books, is to not allow people to learn from their past.     Take @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for example, though that movie is rather gory and morbid, it still tells us of the horrors of the time during @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @NUM1 and that the past is never something that should be let go. Always remeber the past so you can learn from it. Had that movie been cencored or removed I personally would have never learned about the hardtimes of the @CAPS13 and what it can do to a persons soul and emotions.     A book, magazine, movie, etc are all gateways to new worlds, where children can use their imagination and justify what their personality is. I can say that books and songs have saved lives. The other day a friend of mine was on the edge of suicide and was almost a squeeze away from pulling the trigger when I told him that what he was doing was wrong. I was @NUM2 at the time, and i rushed through my ipod to find a song '@CAPS14 to @CAPS15 a @CAPS16' by the @CAPS17. I basically read him the lyrics and he eventually put the idea of sucicide away.     While yes, there aresongs & books like The @CAPS18 and the @CAPS19 that @MONTH1 have provoked people to do crazy things, even to kill. We stilll see more good being done and shown through reading and writing. Because they are all ways to express ourselves. A song can @CAPS15 a @CAPS16 as much as it can take one away. Even then we can that letting imagination flow is better than letting the imagination get cencored. If a book is seen as something unwanted or taken away, it will cause more harm in that it would be wanted more, it would be craved becasue it is an unreachable thing"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3261	2	"The world today in the @LOCATION1 is hardly free. Everything that we see, hear, and read is censored. Is this good or bad? For the most part, it is good. Adults, teenagers, and young children all should only be allowed access to certain types of movies, music, books, magazines, radio stations, and so on.     I don't believe they should be removed, but I do believe these materials should have limited access. Some materials are kind of hard to keep from children and teenagers, but I believe what is kept from children is up to children's parents to say whether or not the children can watch, look at, or listen to what ever it @MONTH1 be that is concidered offensive to some people. Some materials are and should continue to be censored, but to an extent. If a person were to watch an @CAPS1-@CAPS2 movie or even unrated at a movie theater, that person would have to be @NUM1 years of age or older. That is the law, and I believe this is a good thing.      Parents should, also, definitely be the one's to censor what children watch, see, hear, or read. Children for the most part don't know any better. Children are curious little beings. If there is something that a parent has laying around the house that the child has never seen before that child will immediately wonder what this material is. If it were a magazine, they might look at it. I believe that there is a certain age to be allowed to look at these things, because there are a lot of materials in this world that are meant for adults only.    These materials have to be kept open to the public or else all the people who don't find these materials bad would be broke because people fight for what they believe in and that costs money, especially if the people want to take their opinion as to why they should be able to see or hear whatever they want to because they are an adult and they are mature enough to participate in these activities. The people who fight for what they believe in would need a lawyer. Lawyers have to be paid or else they will not work for you.     There are a lot of people around the world who know what they believe is good and bad. It's all in how these people being are raised, and were raised as a child themselves. If people believe something is bad, then they don't have to read, listen to, look at, or watch any of the things they find offensive. These activities are only for the people who do not have a problem with seeing or hearing these materials, therefore these materials should be censored, but only to a certain extent.     If everything in this world that even one person found offensive were removed, then, what about all of the other people who do not find those materials offensive? What about the adults who find no harm in seeing or hearing these things? Not every person in this world has the same opinion.     In conclusion, not everything should be censored. The materials children see and hear is up to parents. People will fight for their freedom to see and hear what they want because people know what they want and will get it any way they have to. This is @LOCATION2, let's not be overly strict about things."	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
3263	2	"Censorship of @CAPS1 of @CAPS2            'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' is a quote from Author, Katherine Paterson. She is saying that there are some books that most people would think to be a little graphic or shocking, but we can not take those books off the shelf because then eventually there would be no books left to read. I agree with her in the sense that we can not take certain books off the shelves in our library. We can not take them off the shelves because that would be taboo in many ways. It would be stepping into hot water because the people would be violating the authors freedom of the press, who would decide what material was right and wrong, and how far is too far when it comes to censorship. These are just a few of the many reasons this is wrong.     Taking certain books of shelves would be against our constitution. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 gives all @CAPS5 citizens the freedom of the press. This means that they can write anything that they want without having to worry about the government's or the citizens' opinions. If we start taking certain books off shelves of libraries because they @MONTH1 include a few controversial things we are violating there natural right. Which leads me to my next argument in if we do allow censorship, who should be in charge?     So many people want to include their opinions on what is right and what is wrong. So, who are we supposed to believe? On person @MONTH1 think somthing is out of line, but the person standing next to them would think it is ordinary. That is what makes this country great. We are a mixture of many different ideas that work together for a common goal. If the government would assign someone to censoring books, magazines, or music, there would be a uproar. How can one person say if something is wrong? And if someone was allowed to censor things, what would be included? How far is to far?     This is a hard question to ask. If we were to allow one person to judge things what should be included? Would the judgement stop at just books, movies, and music? Or would it expand to judgement of clothes and lifestyles? If we implement this system of censorship, our who lives would become one big judgement. Self expression would go out the window because people would be scared of being deemed 'inapropriate.' Our world would become a puzzle of trying to fit in and to not be noticed, rather than standing out and pushing the human race forward.     There are always going to be those people who disagree with things. They find it out of place or offensive. What we have to realize is that everyone views things in different ways. We as people need to learn to accept something out of the ordinary, and try to understand where otheres are comming from.

3270	2	"I think that censorship should not matter in a library due to the fact that some of those books, magazines, music, and movies, are liked by different people everywhere. If you do not like something said or seen in some of the materials, then do not read or watch or listen to any of them. People have different tastes in what they like to listen to or watch or read about. Some people might like rap music but other might like rock music. People that like rock music might not like rap because of some of the languauge used in songs. This is why some people listen to other types of music and do not listen to the type of music that they find offensive. I like rock and metal music just because rap is a little offensive. I have had a lot of family members say that i shouldnt be listening to such music because of the language.     Some people say that reading certain things is a prefferance, but what if you are sitting in a doctors' office and you would like to read a magazine that is just sitting around. If you start going through the magazine and find something you do not like or take offense to, either keep flipping the pages or put the magazine down. You have to think to yourself that there are other people that enjoy or are interested in something you might find offensive. The best thing you can do is put it down and think to yourself that it is not directed towards you. Magazines can have all sorts of stuff hidden beyond the pages, but sometimes you have to look at the cover to see what some of the things that are written in the magazine. Sometimes this can help you decide on rather or not to read it.      Movies are always fun to watch no matter what occation. Some people like certain movies such as action, comedy, romance, or drama. Some people might not like action due to the fact that there is violence in almost all of those movies. Some might not like comedy because of some of the rude humor. There are just alot of types of movies out there and its not the producers fault that we do not like it. People make different movies because everyone is not alike. Some people might get offended by some of the contents of a movie and what you could do to help that is just by reading into the movies before seeing them. I think that cencorship should not matter in a library due to the fact that some of those books, magazines, music, and movies, are liked by different people everywhere."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3271	2	"Censorship of books     Should books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Yes because certain things need to be removed from the shelves for example many things that don't need to be seen out in public. Personaly I think censoring certain things is alright because there are certain books that shouldn't be seen, music that has either swearing talking about drugs or other things, movies that kids shouldn't see like the rated '@CAPS1' or '@NUM1' that has either blood or nudity or somethen on that line, and magazines now magazines there are many types of magazines like for example adult, children, cooking, cleaning, house things, stuff for dogs or cats, and outside stuff.      But censoring things that could be 'offensive' I can't understand how books can be offensive because some books are talking about history or something that has happen to them. Like for example lets just say a colored kid comes in and reads a book on '@CAPS2 slavery' that kid right there is going to get offensive about it and then that kid is going to say 'You owe me something because my anscetores were slaves' no your very wrong there kid because you either read the book wrong or you just didn't understand it. I have done that a couple of times either I got offensive about it and started getting very angry about it or just tose it in the trash because I got mad because I got offensive about it. Don't get me wrong I love reading but like I said before certain things are just ment to never be read or just never be found.     But as for me getting offensive about a couple of books, movies, music, or magazines @CAPS13 I don't read magazines so I can't get offensive about that but books, movies, and music I take very offesively because like if I read lets just say the '@CAPS3 @CAPS4' and then I watch the movies @CAPS13 I take it offensively because nothing didn't tie in with the books or that person didn't direct it right.      For books like I said I love reading books don't get me wrong but I do take very offensively because like something the character did or something that I wished I shouldn't have done something like that or a character dies and it reminds me of a close friend of mine or a teacher something on that line I either cry or I just stop reading the book period.     Music now I could go all day on that because for example I used to love rap with a passion but now rap is just becoming horrible because the rapper is either talking about killing someone, drugs, or 'sex' it's like I said 'horrible' thats one thing that needs to go away for a long long time. But there are many other types besides rap. There is @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7 @CAPS8, punk, @CAPS1&@CAPS10, etc like I said I could go all day on music.     The people who are censoring things like t.v. shows like for example @CAPS11 @CAPS12 seriously there is nothing wrong with that show some people are censoring that because adults think it is bad @CAPS13 people there is nothing bad with that show. I have been watching it since I was five years old and there was nothing bad on it then, then why would there be something bad on it now. All there is, is a grown man acting like a child it's like your going to tell your husband or your wife or your kids '@CAPS13 @CAPS14 I'm sorry but I have to censore you because your a bad person.'      I'm not saying that I would censore it I'm just saying maybe we as people should just take the time to look through some of these shows before censoring them.                                                              @PERSON1"	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
3275	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Newspaper, or to whom this article @MONTH1 concern.     It has become quite aware to me the problem we face in our media today. Information and how individuals seek it has evolved and is still changing at a rapid pace. Technology and new information is so vast its extremely difficult to censor.       Two weeks ago i took my @NUM1 year old niece @CAPS3 to our local public library to find her a book. Once the automatic  doors to the library opened she darted straight to the movie section. I couldnt help but laugh, because I knew thats why she truly wanted to go to the library. When i asked @CAPS3 what movie she was looking at, she turned the cover over with no reservation and, said' @CAPS5 @CAPS6'. 'I can't let my young niece watch @CAPS5 @CAPS6', I thought silently to myself. Then i realized how easy it is for a child to access adult information.      I agree with the statement of @PERSON1 in some degree. I believe if we started taking certian information away completly we would find ourselves ignorant. But when we let  our children ,the future of the world, vonerable to adult information they are greatly effected, @CAPS9 teens and violent video games, or explicit magazines. For example my niece is able to check out any book in the library, books like @CAPS10 @CAPS11 famous book intitled '@CAPS12 @CAPS13 ', which means my struggle in german. My @NUM1 year old niece can read quite well and is very impressionable as are many young children.     Public media outlets need to be more heavily monitored, this includes public libraries, retail stores, the internet, and @CAPS14. I believe books should be censored by content much like movies. This makes the distibutor left responsible and the consumer more aware of the content and its effect"	3	4		3	4	3	4																		
3279	2	"Some people ask, '@CAPS1 books should be censored from libraries?' @CAPS2 are always parents who think that the libraries have books that are inappropriate for their kids, so they speak out against the library and tell them to censor or remove the books. I believe that in order for a library to censor or remove books, magazines, movies, music, etc., it depends on @CAPS1 the subject matter of those things are about.      It's also the parent's job to monitor @CAPS1 their kids read, listen to, or watch. @CAPS2's no reason for a library to censor and take away books because one or two parents complain that it's inappropriate, when the parent can just pull their kids away from the book or movie and move on to something else. It's not the libraries job to watch kids and make sure they don't read, listen to, or watch anything bad. It's the parent's job.      Katherine Paterson, an author, had a good point, also. She said that if she has the right to take books off the shelf, then so does everyone else. If everyone else starts taking books off the shelf, we have no books left. Everyone has a different view of books. @CAPS1 one person thinks is bad, another @MONTH1 not. It goes the other way, too: @CAPS1 one person thinks is good, another @MONTH1 think is bad. On the subject of movies, @CAPS2 are some that should be censored, like the movies containing extreme violence or gore. I remember going to the library when I was a kid, and I wanted to check out a @CAPS3 movie. I couldn't check it out because I wasn't at least @NUM1. I though it was ridiculous because it was only a @CAPS3 movie, and it was harmless.      With magazines and music, it depends on the subject matter of those as well. Some magazines contain inappropriate pictures and articles for young kids, and it's those things that should be kept away from the kids. They don't neccessarily need to be censored or taken away, just kept in another section for teens and adults. The music poses a problem, though. A lot of the music these days can be very inappropriate, especially rap music. Music that sends negative messages and contains a lot of cursing in the lyrics should be censored, in my opinion. It doesn't belong in a library environment where young kids are roaming around and where they're influenced by it.      In conclusion, books, music, movies, and magazines should or should not be censored or removed based on the subject. It just depends on @CAPS1 the subject is about and how inappropriate it is. @CAPS1 one parent thinks is bad, another @MONTH1 not. Overall, I think that books, music, movies, and magzines shouldn't be censored. Parents can just decide @CAPS1 they want their kid(s) to read, watch, or listen to"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3280	2	"Today I am going to talk about certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines. Should they be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? In todays world it is hard to please every living soul. Every one is going to disagree about something in there life time.      Life as we know it, everybody lives it a different way, and in a different place, but everybody has read a book, listened to music, and even read a magazine a time or to. People @MONTH1 interpride it different than others. Therefore I personally dont think they should take articules out of the library that you can learn something from, unless it's something like pornograh then they should deffently take it out.     My conclusion is that you cant please everybody. I think that you shouln't take things out of the library that can help a student learn."	3	3		3	2	2	2																		
3281	2	"At a local library you can find hundreds of books, all of different matter, a different style and of different stories. Not every person enjoys the same type of topic to read about, not every person enjoys the same music style, nor does every person enjoy the same fashion in a magazine or the same articles written in the magazine. No one is the same, we all have different likes and interest.      Some people @MONTH1 find certain books distrubing and inapporiate, that the book shouldnt be allowed to be on the shelves of libraries. That is only some people, what one person finds distrubing and gross another person can find interesting. Not one person is the same so not all books are going to be eye ctaching and interesting to every person. If one person finds a book to be inapporaite, yet another finds it interesting and suggest that book to their friends, is that one whom disagress upon the reading material as unexceptable to thier community allowed to take the book from the shelf, not allowing anyone else to read it. Everyone should be given the same oppertunity to read the book that another made find inapporaite.     People should be allowed to read the material and topics they enjoy to read. But when it comes to a nude magazine, all about sex and being naked, that should be in adult stores only. A child in the library can wonder over to the adult side and pick up the magazine and see all those women, that mother doesnt want her child to be able to pick up and porn magazine or video when she takes the child to the library. You must be eighteen or older to view or buy those magazines, so only keep those magazine in adult stores where childern wont be able to view them. Now some books @MONTH1 have a naked picture in the text but it could be to show how to give a breast examination, to educate women about breast cancer and to help prevent seriousness over that matter, to well educate the people in our society about the matter. Books of diseases that @MONTH1 have nude photos should be allowed, they educate the communitry and save lives. Although not one persons voice or opinion should be heard over others, we were all created equal, we all should be heard. Books are as of the same way, they were all created equal for men, women, boys, and girls to be allowed to read and find adventure, excitment, sorrow and anger. We all have different hungrys for different reading, music and fashin.     In this world today, in our society, and in our community there are different views upon what the children should be reading or should be allowed to pick off the shelf at their local library. Books were created by different people, who dont share the same views,who look upon life in a different way, whose voices arent all the same. The book has a curse word in the text, that doesnt mean the book is an abomination and will poison the community. That book could be one of the best books the child or adult has every read in their life.       Everyone has different views, likes, interest, wants and needs. Not one person shares the same hunger of reading material. We should all be given the oppertunity to read or not read what another person finds inapporaite. The author as well deserves to be heard and not shunned out because some people view his or her material unexecptable for the shelves of their local library. Freedom of speech, freedom of happiness should be implyed with the pursuite to find a book that feeds the hunger of one person. Let every voice be heard, let every word be read, no matter how big, small, or how many imapporaite context is included.Let everyone read as they please and let everyone be marry in what they read"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3282	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3:     @CAPS4 I am @PERSON1 and I have heard there has been a discussion about different things in libraries.  And I would like to let you know what I think about the whole situation.  There are many things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that people believe aren't appropriate.  Many people have differnt opinions then other people. Everyone had a differnt point of view and sees things differently.  Ecspecially when it comes to what is appropriate for kids.     I believe if a child comes home with a book, movies, etc. and their parent does not approve the parent should go and tell the librarian about why she thinks it isn't appropriate.  The librarian should listen to the parent and then take a look at it for herself and see what she thinks about it.  And if she finds it not approprite then she has the right to take it off the shelf.     If the parent comes in and talks to the librarian about why something is not apropriate and the librarian believes it is alright then maybe she needs to just put the book, movie, etc. in a different area of the library.  Like if a little kid finds a book and the parent says its inappropriate the librarian could take that book out of the little kid section, and maybe put it in a older kid area.       I have actaully had an experience with this.  At my old school adults were always complaining about books they didn't think were appropriate.  When the librarian told us, we were upset because us girls loved to read those books.  The librarian at the time thought they were appropriate and really didn't want to take them out of the library.  So she had a great idea.  She took those books, the ones people were complaining about, and put them on their own special shelf behind her desk.  If you wanted one of those books you had to talk to your parent or bring a note in saying that you were allowed to read the book.  It was a really good idea, because if your parent wouldn't allow you to read them you weren't tempted to get one, and wouldnt even see them.  And the people who were allowed and wanted to read them still could with no problem at all.     Another idea I have is if you see a younger kid by older people books, movies, etc. go talk to them about why they are over there and, tell them that, that's not their age level material.  Try to direct them over to their age level area, and try to find them a book, movie, etc they @MONTH1 be interested in.     I believe that everyone has different opinions but just because one person complains it doesn't mean it has to ruin it for everyone.  Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean everyone else does too.  I think censorship should somewhat be in libraries, but not to the extreme.  There should be many different topics in libraries so everyone enjoyes the stuff there.  There should be action,adventure, humor, love, etc.  Talk to people and see what they like.  And just because one person complains, dont take it out right away because to another person they might love it.  Thank you for taking your time to read my opinion, and I hope I helped"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3283	2	"i think that the libraries in generally shouldn't take themusic,movies, or the magazines away. Because you never know what goes on at there home and they just want to get   away and relax the self at the library to read. I think that they shouldn't take the books off the the shelves just for a reason because people love going to the library.And if they don't have those things then what the point of going there.my other thing that they shouldn't take those things away is thatthey will not make a profit. when the people go to the libraryand they dont see those things they are going to wonder want happen.i think that it shouldn't be the children fault that all of the books are gone. It should be the owners and the people that work at the library fault that they made them take the booksoff the shelves.I also think that when the children goes to the library they are going to ask there parent or someone.Where are the book because they want to read and also where are the book so they can check them out.But the people would want to keep getting the books from the library to check them out.I think that the people should not take the books off the shelves for a specific reason and that reason is that people and children would go like on a weekend to read if they dont have any of those things at home.My thing is that they shouldn't just remove anything at all because it going to be a big commotion. So  by removing all of  that would be sad because what if no one has no place to go and they are feeling loney and they want to go the library and read. but my whole point agbout it is that who came up with no books,music or magzines on the shelves.But i also think that if they did that in the real world. Then it would be terrible and a crisis to the people.I think that they should not do that because the people love to read listen to music and etc. I also think that they should not do that because people love going to to releave some stress that they might have and they jus want to go there.I also think that they might not do it anyways because they know the people love there jobs to not to.One of the things that i like is that when i go to the library it is nice and quiet and we can listen to our ipod or our @NUM1 player something like that.Some people just love to go so that they can see there friends and communicate with them to get on the computer. My reason is that they shouldn't do that is they can lose everything like there jobs and etc."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3287	2	"Censorship in librarys could be useful so children and young people don't see what their parents don't want them to see. In the kids section, they have kid's books. In the adult section they have adult books. Those sections are there to keep children from reading or seeing things that @MONTH1 be what their parents don't want them seeing. But then again, a parent could bring their kids into those sections so they can find their books without leaving their child unattended.     Completely taking books out of the library because they are offensive is not a good thing. It takes away certain literature that people might like reading. But then it also makes those people that want it censored uptight. I am a big reader so I have been to librarys many times but I never actually saw any material that was so bad I thought it needed to be taken out. If there was though, they should just make an alternative section for books, music, movies, and magazines that some people think should be put there.      For example, some albums that contain offensive language or topics have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3' stickers on them. It's simple enough to see these stickers so that you can put it in the alternative section of a library. People that like and want to listen to that can easily go to that section and pick it out. Books always have reviews, so people can tell if those are too @CAPS1 or not. The library staff could put those books in the alternative section. Movies always have ratings, so staff could put anything rated @CAPS4 or above on those shelves. Now I've never seen a bad magazine at a library before. I'm sure they would never have magazines such as '@CAPS5' or '@ORGANIZATION1' there. People wouldn't need to worry about magazines from my experience.      That is my solution. Make an alternative section for all the offensive material in the library instead of taking it out completely. That takes away a lot of literature for the people that like that material. You couldn't take away movie classics like '@CAPS6' or '@CAPS7'. Those movies have been put on the highest of best film lists. Yes, they are rated @CAPS4 but no, that doesn't take away the fact that they are great movies. Don't take the material out. Just make a new section for it."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3303	2	"I'm writing this paper today to talk about cenorship of books, movies, music,etc. I think that there should only be certain things on the self that childern can see. If you walk into a store or video store there are so many different things that children are exposed to. They see things and then seeing them makes them think that kind of stuff is @CAPS1. I believe that there should be a very limited selection that children can see. Things that are inappopreite should not be visable to children. I think that things that are bad should be removed from the selves and placed some where else. Also the music on the radio is censored yes but it doesn't mean that people don't know what the words are. There are people that get affended by certain words and they are still on the radio, on @CAPS2, in books. They are everywhere. Things would be completely different if people would watch what they put in stuff. It makes people expecly children believe that certain things are @CAPS1 and they are not. We should have very strict rules on things like that so then nothing inapporpreite is shown to people making them believe it is all @CAPS1. There are rules now on things like that but it doesn't mean that underage children are still getting to see this kind of stuff. That's why I believe there is so much violence now because children are plating video games such as @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 and when they see shooting and stuff they think it's @CAPS1 and they grow up believing that. I am writing this paper today to ask of an article in the paper on stricter rules for these kinds of things and maybe it will start to make things such as violence less"	3	3		3	2	2	2																		
3308	2	"Everyone has their own opinion on censorship in libraries.I think that what libraries choose to put on their shelves should not be censored. Every human being does not have the same taste in what they read, listen to, look at, and watch. In todays generation everyone has their own opinon on censorship. I do not agree with censorship because not everyone likes the same things, has the same thoughts, has the same lifestyle, and wants to learn the same things.     Everyone is an individual and is different in their own way. If libraries wanted to censor what they put out not everyone would get to read, listen, and watch what they wanted. Having libraries censor things would make people feel left out. For example if the library only put out romance things, then what would the action lovers do ? A library is for anyone and everyone who goes to it. One specific type of person does not go to the library.     Everyone grows up in a different lifestyle. Children do not choose their parents. Some parents censor what their kids read and watch,and some do not. Kids who have parents that do not censor what they choose to get at the library might have differnt interests. Not everyone likes the same things.     In school most of the time everyone learns the basic information that is required. Outside of school there is so much more to learn. People can go to librarys' and learn about differnt things that they want to learn about. What people choose to study in their free time can range from drugs and sex to @CAPS1.If libraries censored what people can read, watch, listen to not everyone would get to learn extra information that they wanted to. Libraries can not censor  their materials!     I do not agree with libraries censoring what materials they choose to put out for the public.People are differnt and that is okay. If libraries choose to censor things then not everyone would have equal opprotunities. Parents can censor what their kids read if they want. Not every parents chooses to censor what their kids get at the library; therefore kids have different interests. Human beings do not always want to learn the same things. The librarys' who choose to censor what they put out is not letting everyone have a equal chance to learn. Please let people be who they want to be! Do not censor what libraries put out such as books, music, movies, and magazines"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3309	2	"I beleive it is wrong to remove books from library shelves even if they are found offensive. I have three reasons to support this statement. These reasons are knowledge, different sections of the library, and freedom. I will explain these reasons below but before I begin I would like to add that most people want to censor things that they fear.     If a book is removed from a shelf because someone finds it offensive then the next person who comes along looking for that book can not access it. How is that fair? In life there are many things that can offend people but thats life, you have to learn to let those things go. Everyone has a right to form their own views and oppinions on things, but they can not if they do not read other people's oppinions. Reading expands our vacabulary, at any age. Just because you do not like something does not mean someone else also can not like it. You have to give them a chance to form an oppionion.     Library's are everywhere. If you are concerned about your children finding books that you do not want them to see then take them to a library with sections. All libraries are broken down in sections. Keep your children in the 'children' section and there should not be any concerns in that area. Once your children get older allow them to roam the library and develope an oppinion on what types of books they enjoy most.      We live in @LOCATION1, which since founded has been all about freedom. Some people do not have the money to buy books, or internet, So these people rely on public libraries. If they look for books and can not find a subject that interests them they will not read. They could even be looking for a specific book and not be able to find it because it was taken off the shelf. There is also a religion conflict. There are many different versions of the @CAPS1 but, many different religions. People come from all backgrounds so if they do not beleive in the @CAPS1 do we take that off the shelves too?      In closing I would like to add that I can also see why people would want to censor certain things. However most of the things people do not like to see are things they fear. These people can not hide from reality, not everything in the world is good, so let's not pretend everything is perfect and do our best to contribute to the wellness of society. What better way than letting everyone read whatever they wish"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3313	2	"I believe that there should be a little censorship in libraries. There are some books out there that could be a little offensive and cause some problems, but I also believe that even if a book is insulting you shouldn't be able to hide it from others.     There are some books that have some pretty nasty stuff in them that you could find in a library. Since a library is public lots of people go in to get books. What is to stop a kid to getting to one of these books, or movies you can find in libraries? Do you really want a child to check something out that has violence, horrible language, and sexual innuedo? What can you do about this problem? You could censorship the books and hide them from the public, but that would cause another problem.     The idea of censorship might sound ok, but really it's not the right thing to do. Hiding things from the public just because it might have some bad things in it is a little over the top. If you are an adult and your in the mood to read something with a little violence in it you'd have to go somewhere else because someone just took that book away because it had some swear words that they don't find appropriate in books. Censorship would just make it harder for adults to find some books that they would want to read.     So what do you do if there is an offensive book on the shelf? Do you just leave it there, or take it away so no one can read it? You could just put age restrictions on the books. If someone underage wanted to check out the book, they would have to get permission from their parent. That way the book can stay on the shelf and be read by anyone"	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
3314	2	"People all judge things differently. Thats why I feel that libraries should keep those kinds of books. What @MONTH1 be found as a offenisve book to one person might not to another one. If there are people saying that the certain books are offensive, then they should take them out of the library. You shouldn't take one book out because one person thinks it is offensive.          What might be offensive to one person @MONTH1 interest another. The person that doesn't think it is, should have the right to read the book. That would be taking the rights for people away because a person finds it offensive. The person might find the book useful because they want to learn about the topic more. They will never get to learn about it if they take the book out because one person finds it offensive or doesn't like it.           I personally like watching movies or reading books that are thrilling and @MONTH1 have some violence in them. If the library took these books or movies out because a mother saw her son or daughter read or waching then it would be wrong. The mother would be taking away what I like to read and watch. Thats not fair at all. A way to solve this issue is to have certain areas for each type of age group; therefore, they would be watching or reading types of things acceptable for their age group.          I understand the fact that some people take things offensively. Also that they don't want their children to pick up a book or movie that isn't acceptable for their age group. They have to understand though that sometime people like those type of things, and they are taking it away from the people who enjoy them. It is like taking rights away from people because they don't agree with what is happening. It wouldn't be right at all to take those books out of the library.                     All people have different views about things. You can't change a thing if one person doesn't like it. People have rights to pick up a book if they want to or not. Not everyone is the same, so not all people are going to think the same way. I like things that some people might not like, that is just how human nature is"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3319	2	"Censorships in the libraris  would be liked cutting the worlds air supply. It would be taking away from a readers imagintion. stoping readers from being able to express their mind.      My veiw on censorship in the libraries would not be needed. Libraries around the world do good jobs keeping certain books in the apperpate ages levels. By removing certain materials out of libraries would cause reader attention to why their being removed. Then readers would demanded that we leave their books alone. Then fight for more books like those and then they would need censorships in libraries.      Books were made to keeping people wondering, learning, and excited. By cutting away different materials would be stopping people from enjoying the world of minds. More you take books away the more the population on watching television gets higher. Then there would be no more author and more actors and actress. People minds would not be wondering, learning or being kept excited.      I remember when i was a little girl i went to the library. I was in the library looking for a book. I wet to the big kids side as i called it and tried to check the book out. The library lady told me i was to young and showed me to my age level books and took the book back. Then i was able to check a book out.      So all i am sating is that censorships are not needed in libraries. That would be tking away from a librarains job. So dont take away readrs imagintion"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3326	2	"I believe that indeed certian books sould not be on libraries shelves. And some people @MONTH1 feel the need to remove books of their choosing but, I also say that if the library sees it fit to put such books on their shelves that is their problem. I believe that if you do not like the books then stay away from them. Now if the books are only meant to be seen by adult eyes then, yes by all means remove them. I personally know parents that would not allow their childern to need a book just because in the review they read the main characters kissed. I find it rediculous, but that is the way they parent their kids. And as long as they dont take it upon themselves to force they parenting methods on to libraries and other learning places just because of the books I am fine with it.      I find that some people see books on slavery and the holocost and such topics to be offensive. I see those books as our history, those topics are taught to us in school and we will most likely hear about such things as we grow up. What is the difference between learning about them now and learning about them as a adult? People seem to be trying to shield the world from thing like swear words. Why? If a book has a few curse words oh well, tell your kids to stay away from it if you think its bad. But, do not take it upon yourself to remove that book from our library. People have different views, we always have and we always will. If a parent feels so strongly about a few books get a postition and get signatures saying that these books should be removed or atleast moved to a different part of the library. Do not force your thoughts on some one else"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3329	2	"I do belive that certain stuff should be removed from the libraries like stuff that little kids should not be able to see. They should be in the other room to where you have to have like a id to get in. They should make sure about this cause you dont want your little son looking at like playboy. I know i dont.     Little kids should not be reading books with alot of swearing and evrything cause no kid needs to act like that. It bothers them they could get in trouble with school and at home.     Yes it @MONTH1 be true that adults like to read about sex, and drugs but do we really want our kids reading the same stuff that we read. Some people just need to think about what they just leaving out in the librarys because little kids loves to see new stuff all the time.     So next time you working at the library or just there vistiing you might wanna watch where you put stuff at cause little kids will see it."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3339	2	"There are so many books and magazines, music, and movies to be discovered in this world. Some are funny, sad, wierd, scary, etc. And then there are some that are questionable to others on wheather it was even nessecary to even put the the material on the shelf of a library in the first place. I for one am not one of those people who would question a book, magazine, movie or music. I believe that everyone's voice needs to be heard somehow and if we all take a voice away that we do not like, then we will lose a lot of voices.     We are all entitled to our own opinion. When it comes to some things some are more opinionated than other, but in the end we all have something that we feel strongly about. There are some people who want to express their feelings with the whole world with people that understand and agree with what they feel. If we take that away from people, then how will we all connect? Some things @MONTH1 come across as offensive to others, but who has the right to say that something should not be shared with the rest of the world. I have observed that when people have the same interests in things like music, books, or movies then it gives people a way to come together and talk about something. I have witnessed at concerts everybody seems to connect because we are all there for the same reason, to see the band or person that we all like to listen to. Everybodys different and likes to have their own personal preference on something. Like Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think she was trying to say that if we all take a book off the shelf that we do not think should be on there, then there is going to be nothing left for anybody to read. Then what will we do?      Theres such a variety of materials that are needed to be discovered wheather it is a book, music, or movie everyone has their own special type that they enjoy. I do not think that censorship is a good idea for any sort of material on a shelf. Theses materials are what keep people connected with each other. I think it is very important to not censor anything because it does not just give the writer a voice, it give a voice for the people that agree with the material of the book, movie, or music"	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
3344	2	"Offensive media is everywhere. From books to music lyrics, our culture embraces us with it. Children that see inappropriate media can pick up bad behavior. This can then lead to a child having a hard time associating with his peers. Adults are also affected by inappropriate media if they see their favorite celebrity or  any other role model use inappropriate behavior. This could make an adult emotionally unhealthy and they @MONTH1 become violent or depressed. Finally, our world could be better if offensive media were abolished altogether. People's lives could be enriched with good, clean entertainment instead of being corrupted with inappropriate media. One can clearly see that offensive media must be pulled from our country's libraries immediatley.     Inappropriate media is surrounding us daily, including children. What children see they imitate, even in the first couple years of their lives. So if they hear a swear word on t.v or see someone doing drugs, they @MONTH1 imitate it. Clearly this is inappropriate behavior for a child. If the child is exposed to inappropriate media, for a long period of time, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to use it in everyday life. Their social skills and mind is being corrupted because of offensive media. Libraries should pull inappropriate media off of their shelves because it can corrupt a child's mind.      Another reason why  libraries should pull off offensive media is because adults can pick up different offensive habits as well. Just as children can pick up the offensive habit of swearing , so can adults if they are exposed to it for a long period of time. Besides swearing, adults can also think that killing someone is ok because they saw it in a movie. They could then pick up a violent weapon and try to kill someone if they are angry. This is not a healthy way to express your feelings towards someone if they are making you angry. Our country's libraries should pull off inappropriate media from their shelves because it can turn adults into being emotionally unhealthy.      Finally , inappropriate media should be pulled off library shelves because our world could be a better place without it. Media is one of the root causes of why people act the way they do. If they see their favorite celebrity getting arrested for a @CAPS1  in a magazine, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to drink and drive. Another example is if people read about someone doing drugs in a book, they @MONTH1 want to try and experiment with drugs  themselves. This can lead to people doing crazy things that can be harmful to other lives around them.      Offensive media is almost anywhere. When children see inappropriate media , they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to imitate it. Adults, when exposed to enough offensive media, can pick up nasty habits like swearing, killing or doing drugs which , inturn , can lead to to being emotionally unhealthy. With out inappropriate media on our library shelves, our world would be a better place. We would have less conflict, less deaths ,and better lives that are enriched, not corrupted , with quality media. Millions of lives could be made better if libraries pulled off inappropriate media from their shelves"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3346	2	"Should books, magazines, or movies that are found offensive be removed from the shelves? I think that the book, magazine, or movie should stay on the shelf even if it is found offensive. If it is offensive to one person, it doesn't mean that it is to every person. Everyone has their own view on the subject of offensive or not.     I don't think the person that wrote the book or magazine meant for it to be offensive. They were just writing what they thought went along with the story and some people took offense from the book or magazine. But, they shouldn't argue over it because, like I said before, the author probably didn't mean for it to be offensive.     In conclusion, the books should stay on the shelves. Everyone has different point of view. The author probably didnt mean for the book or magazine to be offensive."	2	2		2	3	3	3																		
3350	2	I don't think that they should be removed from the shelfs. Everyone has a right to read it at some point in time. To were no little kids can rent the book. If they are complaining about how it's volgar or sexual. Then you shouldn't take it away. Try something else such as an adult section. One person @MONTH1 love a book that has some violence in it and on the other hand you @MONTH1 have a person who is real religous and can't stand to see it.      There are very many view points of this topic. The parents who don't want their kids to be exposed to this type of life style. Some people don't really think about it being as bad as the next person. If it's a book you dislike on a book shelf and you don't like it put out in plain sight. Should you really be the one to make the decision on who takes it down?     Some people don't know what their kids like to read. If they have the final thought on what gets taken down it @MONTH1 affect the kids reading habbits. What if your kid wants to read a horror book and you choose not to let those kinds of books on the shelf any more. Then they don't want to read the books that are left up on the shelf. I'd rather read a book that interests me than a book that I dislike.     My point of view on this topic is simple. I don't think the parents should be in controle of what we read as long as it's appropriate. I think the decision should be left for the government to say which book should and shouldn't be taken away.	3	4		3	4	3	4																		
3353	2	"My thoughts on censorship in libraries is yes some books, music, movies, magazines, and etc., should be taken off of the shelves if they are offensive. If they are left on the shelves some very small child or teens could come up and reach for a book and find that it has bad things in it that are ment for adults. The child will ask the caregiver that they are with '@CAPS1 does this picture mean?', and they will most likely not know @CAPS1 to say at that moment. Parents and caregivers are not always up to explaining or want to explain as soon as they have to about things sometimes. Everyone goes through life with different things they have to learn at different rates. Somethings should be taught when we young like how to brush our teeth, but somethings should be left until we are older like having babies or drinking.           When parents going through the explaination of something like making babies you do not want it to be when they are only five years old. With books in a library with pictures of men and women questions like that do get asked to young. Libraries are public places and should be safe for any age no matter whether they are young babies or adults. Public schools have libraries in them also, and i would not want a child reading a @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 book with bad or offensive things in it. It does not just have to be a book with bad things in it, but it could also be something to do with religions. Everyone has their thoughts and comments on at least one religion. If you have grown up a @CAPS4 your whole life, and a kid picks up a book dealing with jews they will ask someone about it.      Young kids and teens can always find things that they should notat certain ages, but why not make it less by not letting a library be censorshiped? When you were younger your parent did not want to take you to the library and be asked an offensive question because of a book, music, movie, or magazine. It has worked for so many years, so we should not have to change it now."	2	3		2	2	4	2																		
3360	2	"Libraies should not be able to remove books, movies, and  magizines off the shelves just because some kids might be offended. If the town libraries and school libraries took out the cool movies, magizines, and books that most kids love to read and watch then the kids that like those books , movies, and magizines would not return to the library any more.           For example, I like to listen to hard rock, heavy metal, and rap. But, the people that go to church just like to listen to church music. If your with your friend one night because he invited you to come to church with him and you pull in the parking lot listening to your rap music some people @MONTH1 not like it. This doesn't mean that they should take the things people don't like off the shelves in order to satisfy them.          Libraries should have a policy stating that if a child should check out a book or magizine or rent a movie, that they should have the childs parents sign and return a permission slip stating that their child has their permission to rent this book, magizine, or movie. Libraries should have an age limint to check out books and magizines. If kids would want to rent a movie then they would have to have a permission slip signed by their parents and returned. This permission slip will and can be used for all movies.           Libraries should not remove their books, magizines, or movies. They should make a policy to allow older kids to check them out. So, library material should be a choice"	4	4		4	3	4	3

For example librarys in the world that the need to borrow somes books for many people took, and the people can takes the book without pay nothing, thats the people want that the librarys are free.  Also the librarys need to spants with many parts in the world that many people think that did's great idea because many people said no because the librarys can't not borrow a books or dvds,  magazines, etc.   Thats why the librarys need that the people know that the   librarys not borrows books thats happed in the world....  I think the librarys need to do is go with the people and show what they have in the library and borrow books dvds thats the people want too... sometimes the library can rent the dvds that are interesting that the people can't find in the other place, like movies new but if the library not have the dvds somes people can go to the library and give to the bookstor that you can find in the other place. would we have to read more like many people do thats great idea.

3364	2	"Censorship is important. Especially pertaining to what books, magazines, movies, and music almost all people are reading, watching, and listening to. Some of the media such as books and magazines and such in libraries everywhere can be highly offensive to certain people or can send off the wrong message to children and teens. So, should we take them off the shelves?     I personally think no, most media aspects that are on the shelves in libraries can be very offensive to people, but alot of it has to do with people's opinions. The readers are the ones that are claiming that the books and other media aspects in libraries are offensive. The authors and directors and singers just do what they do, and the judgement and opinions all come from the people, fans, and critics. We shouldn't be taking it all off library shelves just because it is offensive to some people.     This leads back to the quote from Katherine Paterson when she states: 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We can't take everything off the shelves because everyone's opinions are different so if we censor everything, there won't be anything left. Right now, they are doing a good job with censoring everything such as putting a rating on video games, and movies. Rated @CAPS1 movies are known to be for adult watchers and same goes for video games. Music they play on the radio is censored of all the foul language, so they make an effort. That leaves people the choice to watch, listen, or read the things they want, and they have to know beforehand that it might offend them. Although sometimes people think censoring those media aspects is not enough censorship, that's about all that can be done to not offend others. By taking everything off the shelves because of people's opinions, it could potentially make someone else angry or them being lacked of the things they want to read or watch. Censorship can be wholesome without removing all media off the shelves and in the world"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3367	2	"@NUM1ed     The censorship of certain media is such a controversial topic. Whether a certain piece of material is considered offensive and should be censored or not is more often opinionated rather than logically opposed, because it really does all come down to someone's opinion on this matter. It is too difficult for most people to step in someone else's shoes or be persuaded from a viewpoint different from their own or even escape pressures from the general public to consider something else. Things get censored for a lot of reasons, too! Sometimes they're just so intentionally offensive that perhaps the author or producer wants it to be censored or would appreciate the controversy, or that a new view or opinion is so radical and against a majority of the population that it is just considered offensive for being so different. Well, when does someone have a right to take a song off the air or pull a book permanently from a shelf?     The first thing that needs to be contemplated is if something is offensive or not. There are extremes to pieces of media where one sometimes must ask, '@CAPS1 were they thinking when they made that?' A movie being so outrageously graphic or violent is a fine example (although the same thing can happen in books, just with words instead of pictures). At the same time though, whether or not something you might think as unnecessary gore in a film might just be @CAPS1 I'm excited to see when I go to the cinema - it's all opinionated!          Another interesting thought is that somebody might come up with a revolutionary, radical scientific theory and write a whole novel or film a documentary explaining it all, but certain groups of people might claim that it is offensive to them. However, we might investigate into that theory ourselves and not be offended in the slightest. This is understandable though, people grow up in an environment that has its own set of ethics and principles, and people will honestly believe them and probably stick with those fundamentals throughout their lifetime. If you go against someone's beliefs that they hold so dear like that, they would of course be offensive to them. Does that mean that the something should be censored just because it offends a couple of groups in a population?     Whether or not something is to be torn from the access of the public is left up to the opinions of the general public themselves. The opinion of the public is created by the current time, trends, ethics, and problems that are going on. When something goes against too many of those things, people get upset. If most people are upset by something, it will probably start disappearing from sight. It's bad for business, and libraries are losing customers already due to most people not having an urge to read anymore with all of the stuff that you can do otherwise. Certain things can just put a bad taste in your mouth, and if someone gets that too often when they go to a library, they probably won't go there anymore.     So when it comes down to censorship in libraries, or anywhere, its just a bunch of opinions. If the general public does not like something, it will stop showing up. Certain books or other pieces of media are asking for the controversy that many subjects bring, while others are just unintentionally going against certain groups of people. People's beliefs are determined by where they grew up and when, and they'll hold on to those things for their lifetime. If something goes against those, people will be offended, and if enough people are upset, it gets taken away"	4	5		4	4	4	4																		
3378	2	"People believe that censorship is impotant in Libraries. They believe that things should not be released if they have a bad subject matter. They feel that it is sending a bad message to children and teaching them horrible things to do and say. I disagree with them on this and these are the reasons why.     I feel that books/music/movies/magazines shouldn't be taken off the shelf is they have cuss words inside, i feel that they should continue to sell them even if they have bad words inside. I feel this way because there are alot of horrible things in this world. Children have to learn that, and i feel like cussing or anything of that subject matter isnt that big of a deal there is so much more to worry about then a couple of bad words children read and listen to. I listen to music that has cuss words on the inside and i also read books with bad words and it doesnt infulence me in any kind of way. So we shouldn't always try to control every one we should just let them be on the shelfs and let them or there parents decide if it's innaporpate or not.in conclusion i feel again that they should be on the shelfs and people should be allowed to listen/read whatever they want to. if it doesnt harm anyone or themselfs then let it go on and happen. let them do what they want to"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3381	2	"I do not think that books should be taken off shelves just because it's offensive or because others don't like it. If everyone took the books, music, and movies off the shelves that they didn't like, then all that would be left would be empty bookshelves.     I believe that the library was a right to keep whatever they want on the shelves. Some @MONTH1 say that the library has inapproprite books to check out, or they don't want their kids to pick up a book they don't like and read it. I think that's why the library has the shelves marked in sections for example, adult, young adult, children, and referance.      I've never seen a book that was offensive to me in a libray, which brings me to another point. Everyone has a opinion, if a book is offensive to you it might not be offensive to someone else. For example say that you saw a book on animal mating and you thought it was a bad book for the libary to have because, little kids might pick it up. Well that is your opinion because, if a biology teacher seen a book like that then they might want to check it out.      Another thing is that the library has certain book for a reason. Say that there is a book in the library that is about slaves, this book might be offensive to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 but, this book is there to inform people about slavery. What is offensive to some isn't offensive to others.     In conclusion, I believe that books should not be taken off library shelves just because it is offensive to you. Everyone just has to remember that people have their own opinions about things and you just have to deal with it. That's why I think that books should not be tooken off shelves"	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
3384	2	"Should offensive material be removed from the library? I think no, and there are many reasons as to why I disagree with this idea. Many books, movies, and magazines are not ment to offend people, but just to let the reader know how the author feels. I think that the books, movies, magazines, etc. should stay on the shelf because if they are removed what are we left with? Seems like all that would remain would be the dictonary. I think that when Katherine Paterson said, 'Children or any other children have taken off the shelf' that she was making a big mistake.      So what seems to be offensive to people? Topics such as gosip and politics are a gold mine for authors in the @DATE1. Yet people find these topics to be offense probably due to that persons backround. If aomeone find a read to be offensive, then they should stop reading and that be it. Instead, people deside to go on a rampage against that magazine or whatever they read and what it banned for life from others to read. Readers have the choice to read whatever they want and if they disagree with that subject, just move on with their lifes.      At the library I attend many poeple different shapes and sizes walk through the door everyday. Many of them like a different subject then the others, so its commen to find everybody reading about a different topic. Sure someone here and there does not gree with an author, but never decide to go crazy about it. Instead they just go pick a different read to enjoy for themselves. People read what they want to so they can enjoy it, not to bash the wuthor for his writing.          In my own read's, I have found at times stuff i disagree with. Instead of going off the deep end and getting all excited about it, I choose to think about where the author is coming from and try to understand his side. On the other hand, some movies are ment to be for one type of audience when instead another audience see's the material. This still should not get movies or whatever the material is banned from the library. When on the box it says rated for teenagers and up, that means it is not for a four year old to watch and their parents get mad at them for it. If people followed what the box says and listen to the guidlines, then there would be no problem.     I disagree with @PERSON2 when she said that some books, magazines, movies, etc. should be removed from the library. People have the right to read anything and to see anything they want, and if they disagree well they should just deal with it. In my own exprience, I have not found there to be a problem in my community library with people wanting content removed. Once people start following guidlines and reading the boxes and still disagree, then maybe will have something then. But until then, we should keep our nations libraries the way they are today"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3386	2	"Have you ever imagined a @CAPS1 without movies or music to entertain you? A @CAPS1 that has no books to read or magazines to inform you upon the latest gossip and fashion? Well, if items are banned from being seen or read then there will be no creativity in the @CAPS1, there will soon be no books or magazines to read, no music to listen too, and no movies to watch, and you will not be able to express yourself or your opinions. I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.     If the @CAPS1 is left without certain materials there will be no creativity. Everyone will be forced to think the same thoughts if they can't learn about other thoughts that are protrayed to be offensive. No one can read about a topic that they are interested in if it is banned, this will cease creative thinking by not allowing people to think differently.     In the process of deciding what books are offensive and which are not offensive, all books will eventually be eliminated. Certain topics aren't liked by everyone and, as Katherine Paterson says, '...if I have the right to remove that book... so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Paterson is exactly right too; if one person has the right to remove a book, so does everyone and this will cause everyone to take off that book that they dislike so much. Also, everyone likes different kinds of books and different topics, and this will cause less self expression because if someone doesn't like books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because they think it is offensive to @CAPS4, then there will be no books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 on the shelves for anyone to learn about it.     Everyone will turn out to be the same if they can't express themselves or their opinions. If a certain topic is banned for being discovered as a offensive topic then this will result in the thought being banned. If you can't read or watch a topic you shouldn't be able to think or talk of the topic either because you will offend someone. Also, if people can pick what books can be in a library, that will eventually be transferred over into other areas, such as clothing, food, thoughts, etc.. Eventually everyone will be wearing the same clothes, eating the same food, and thinking the same thoughts.     I do not believe that certain materials should be exterminated from the shelves if they are found offensive. If specific materials are banned: creativity will be eliminated from our lives, eventually all materials will be banned, and we will all be the same by the lack of self expression. If you haven't ever thought about a @CAPS1 without books, moves, music or magazines; I hope you have learned how crule and boring the @CAPS1 would be without all of those materials."	4	4		4	3	4	3

Why beacuse there are many people out there that read read stuff and listen to stuff that you might not like at all. when i first saw this question i answer to my self that, ''That if all people think the same way this world would be boring, and i answer the question by saying that there should not be any books remove or music remove, from any shelves' why beacause we all don tlike the same thing or do the same thing.     In first place, I know that there are many different kind of thing that people beacause they love doing it and some dont do those kind of things beacause they really dont like or dont care about it. This is answering the question about removing books, music, or magazines from shelves even if the article the book, music, etc, say's or if its offensive to other people, that is not a reason to remove stuff. There are thing that you enjoy doing and things that you emjoy reading, listening, and looking, etc that other people dont like or hate about it.     In second place, not only beacause you dont like something people should stop doing those things or stop buying those thing, NO!!, that is not the case here @CAPS1. or @CAPS2. you should not care just for you or do what ever is right for you. If you are a good person that wants to be someone in the future dont just care about you care about the other too, beacause you'll need those person or those book in the future when ever your falling down.     In my conclusion, about this article. I think that people should not remove any thing from any library even if its found offensive to other people, those thing help other in life to do what they really want to do, while other are getting hurt for those offensive this that are writting on a little peace of paper. Hope this latter help you all think about and change your decision about this case, hope you all make the right decision that would not affect anyone in general.     Thank you for taking your time to ready what I really think about removing articles from libraries"	3	4		3	3	3	3

If there is a group of people that are interested in a book and want to read it more then once they will like telling a new person about it. Then if another student has decided they don't like the book and they don't want anyone else reading it becuase they find it offensive then I honestly believe it shouldn't be taking off the shelves.      I think it would be different if everyone found the book offensive, but if it's just one or two people complaining then I don't think they should take it down and ruin it for everybody else. It's just a book and students should know just because it's there doesn't mean its directed towards them. I think they should overlook it.     If your playing some music, dacing around, and just having fun with it then thats good. Now, if there is cussing and talking about drugs and those sort of things in a song then don't play it in a school system or around someone that @MONTH1 be religious or against that kind of thing because they @MONTH1 not like it and think that your into that sort of things. They might not want to be around you as much. Show them respect and play something everyone can have fun with. So if the libary has this type of music it should be monitored as to who checks it out.     Movies are something you have to look out for too. Movies already have ratings so this kind of helps for people to check them out and make sure the movie would be safe to watch. If your getting movies from the libary then I would think it would already been watched by an adult there to make sure it can be watched by a student or a child. I wouldnt want my little sibblings watching something that they didn't need to see or hear.     You have to watch out for magazines too. You want a magazine that is going to be interesting and clean. Kids @MONTH1 not know what is bad from good, but you still have teenagers. You don't want kids seeing nudity, cussing, or drugs in any magazine. If I were to walk in a library and see those kind of things in a magazine I would suggest you to take it off the shelves. I would only suggest that so the kids will have a healthy thought about things. I wouldn't want them thinking about doing anything bad like they saw in the magazine. I'm just looking out for their safety.     Libraries @MONTH1 always need advice. They need to always have an eye out for things and make sure everything is clean and so that everyone can look at it, read it, or watch it. I'm glad we have these safety ideas for kids. I hope everyone has an eye out for these kind of things. I know I if I were to ever have children I would want them around something they understand and know, nothing bad and harmful. So thanks to libraries that have an eye out for things like this"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3402	2	"In the world, there are just some things that our children should not be exposed to. I believe that the media such as music, magazines, and movies set a high bar for the individuals in our society. I highly disagree with what the media feeds to our minds as to the way our looks and lifestyle should be.     The library is a place where most children go to feed their imaginations with colorful books with morals; but the library is also where adults go to free their minds of work and to escape many of life's responsibilities. Most children from ages @NUM1 to @NUM2 draw a curious mind to the very adult world and seek to find answers. Now the library is not a place where a child can recieve adult information right? Wrong! the library shelves are open to any and everyones advantage. A child can just as easily come across the wrong track to take ones innocence. Some parents in sociey believe that their neighborhood is a perfect harm free enviornment to raise children. Little do parents know, it is a very uncensored world and at anytime a child can learn of it's exsistance.     The media draws it's attention to captivate our children. We have to watch what we let our kids watch, listen to, and read. For example, the girl in the magazine who just recently got a nose job because her nose was too big is feeding the idea to your eight year old daughter. She believes that she can recieve surgery to fix her big nose that the kids at school tease her about. Maybe your son listens to rap or rock music that condones the use of violence, drug, and alcohol use. He will think its ok to pick fights at school with other children or curse the teacher. Or the movie with the sex scene in it could give your child the idea to go out and practice what was taught.     In our society, there should not be an image that our children should try and sustain. We should teach our children that life is better explored through @PERSON1's '@ORGANIZATION1' or through the wonderful adventures of 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2'. Parents should feed kids 'imagination' and not feed their 'image'. Life for our children should be about fun, knowledge, and life experience; but not everything that is on the shelves of our local library."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3406	2	"Offensive literature, sexual content, disagreeable topics. Books all have those things to someone some where. It would be impossible to get rid of all of the books that offended everyone and still have books left. There are many reasons why censorship is pointless and wrong. Censorship only causes curiosity. Censoring books could take away from learning. The real world is not censored so books should not be either.     Consorship only causes curiosity. Young kids every day are told what to do and what not to do. Many people know that children are most likely to want to do exactly the opposite of what they are told to do. Being censored from things makes people want to rebel and learn the truth. No one likes to be told what they can and can not do. The same goes for being told what you can and can not read. No one wants the truth cut out of  their reading materials.      Censoring books could take away from learning. In school children are required to read many different books in their english classes. Some books, depending on the teacher, have what some would consider offensive language and topics. What some people do not understand is that reading those things are a part of life. Reading foul language would not be any more offensive than if someone was to use the same foul language in front of you in real life. In fact, the real life situation would seem to be more offensive. If we are censored from these things how will we learn that they exist.     The real world is not censored so books should not be either. You can not go walking down the street and expect a loud beep to randomly play over someone's foul banter everytime they curse. When someone says something offensive in the real world you have to learn to deal with it appropriately and maturely. We can not cut out peoples offensive banter in real life so why should we do it in our reading material. Has no one ever heard of freedom of speech? That ammendment was created for a reason, to let @CAPS1 speek their beliefs.     Everywhere we look today things are being censored and 'cleaned up' to make others happy who @MONTH1 be offended by whatever it is they are censoring. Sometimes it is appropriate for offensive language or topics to be written about. People need to be able to speek their minds and beliefs. But people also need to be able to have constructive critisism and be mature about offensive writing. Everyone will be offended in one way or another some time in their life by something they will read or already have read. It is just life"	4	3		4	4	4	4																		
3410	2	"I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music,            magazines, ect should be removed from the shelves.              Libraries or any place else. I believe that if someone wanted to          know more information about something the library or the @CAPS2 should be able to provide it for them. Imagine if the           Libraries and the @CAPS1 started putting these materials away, many people wouldnt bother to go to either. The @CAPS2 in my      eyes is a place that shows me where we have been, what we have been threw, and things we have accomplished while we           have been there.In the @CAPS1 could you imagine walking around touring seeing nothing about you past?,'No, I couldn't.          Eventhough things @MONTH1 seem offensive in ones eyes, it could be the history of anothers. Many people now days relie on the           useage of the magazines, books,and music to get information from. I believe that everyone has a right to know what has                happened in their pass to have gotten to their future, so taking away information that @MONTH1 seem offensive to someone           else isn't fair. I believe that we should keep all information in lilbraries, @CAPS1, art shows because everything has it's on history behind it, and if we just cover it up we will never know. I myself, 'would want to know, than not to ever have known.'"	3	3		3	2	2	2																		
3412	2	"Offensive @CAPS1 @CAPS2     @CAPS3 entering a @CAPS1 you know your are going to find something interesting to read,listen to, or even watch. Most people use librarys to find information on a certain topic, some of these topics are not always appropiate for certain age groups. I do believe that materials on any subject should reflect how people see the world now. Most kids go to the @CAPS1 and look to find books that interest them, sometimes they cross book about stuff they should'nt know about yet. Libraries should be allowed to have anything on there shelf that they please but allow it to certain age groups.     @CAPS3 you were a little kid and you wanted to look up information on racing, you might have passes by many books about racism. As a little kid you might not know what that is but all you have to do is pick up and read. That kid just went from reading abot nascar to reading about racism and different races. I believe that book should be kept in order of age. @CAPS3 a teenager goes into the @CAPS1 to look up a book, they should be able to go to a section for teens and get a book on there topic. In most libraires there are topics such as sex, killing , and viloent matters. Kids should not be allowed to view that detail until they are ready for it.     If I am at the @CAPS1 I will always look for a book interest me. My skills on choosing books for myself has changed since i was @NUM1 or @NUM2. Now that older and like to read, I read more books about action and mystery. I was at the our hometown @CAPS1 and saw a @NUM3 year old kid looking at books about pregnancy and was shocked to see what he was reading after he put the book down. That same day I came across a younger kid approaching his father with a book about sex and one about killing. @CAPS3 I saw this I was suprised to see what was happening. I do believe that libraries should be able to showcase what they have but in certain age sections..     Kids visit the @CAPS1 all the time and looking for books to strike interest and will always find something different that they should not be exposed too. Libraires would have trouble containg what kids read, so they should exposed all the differnt topics. @CAPS3 your little and your reading about these topics, you will then be more informed @CAPS3 your just little older.     Next time @CAPS3 you visit the @CAPS1 check and see what kids in your local towe are talking and reading about. You will be suprised @CAPS3 a child apporachs his parents with a book about sex. I think that all libraies should exposed what they want @CAPS3 they want to ensure knowledge to everyone."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3413	2	"I don't think nothing should be taking off the shelves at the libraries, if it's educational to your child in a certain way it should stay. Children can learn alot from the books at the libraries. If you need help or answers about certain things you can always find what you are looking for in a library, they have all the answers. You can not get everything off the internet some stuff you have to look up by opening a book. As I was growing up, I was able to get what I needed done for my school at the library.     It's so many things at the libraries that's educational, you just have to know what you are looking for. For some of these adults, if you was having a hard time looking for what you needed at the library, do not mean the same for your child. Sometimes your children has a better time understanding then you did at their age. Parents please don't take away the good things out the libraries that could really help your child at times. If it was not helpful, they would have never put it in the library from the start.     There are things that you would be better off finding in a book, because not everthing is on the enternet. So many sciencest found their information in a book, because its easier. You learn so many good things from a libraries. The books and things in a library help you with so much research. Taking materials out of a library I would have to disagree."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3420	2	"Sometimes i think its always good to have an anappropiate material on the shelves of stores or a library. i feel this way because of when you see stuff that is offensive, most people are willing to buy. Or maybe when you been through rough times in your life, people like to read books that can be offensive be cause it was a reflection of the way they've been brought up.         My views on censorhip contain to keep the offensive materials because its what people like best. Music, magazines, books, and movies. All of these materials can entertain adults, and teenagers because of the anappropiate sayings. It seems to give people to boost up their style and ways to act, such as music as the number one offensive material. Music comes from everywhere around the world, where young teens adapt to that kind of music and starts to feel that anapprpiate vibe.          Another reason my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials is because of what we see and watch. Movies and television. when we watch a movie thats is offensive and that can be very anappropiate, you learn from whats in the movie. Most people make movies that can teach lessons if your willing to follow behind, or some movies contain advice for people that are going for the wrong things in life. Thats one of my main reasons i think the newspaper should keep offensive movies in stores. Television is basically the same for movies. You can learn a lot from a offensive @CAPS1 show, you can learn what and what not to do.          Also my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials of what we read, books; books are entertainment and what most of us like to do when we have free time off our hands. People seem to read books because of the catorgories that most likely are to fit the way they are, such as reflections of peoples lifes, rough, lovely, funny and drama. We attend to read these offensive books because of what some of us been through as a kid or just would like to read it because they wanna maybe feel the same sympothy that some one else @MONTH1 have had. Also books can be adviceful of ehat people want to do in life, careers that you @MONTH1 be intersted in.     last but not least on my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials like magazines. Magazines are the least offensive object that is placed on a shelf. I go against the reason of magazines to be on the shelf because its alot of gossip. I believe gossip is one of the main reasons why most people buy magazines. Also because of the false information. The false information that that give, is what we wanna buy. But for the most part of my oppinion, i believe that this material should not be in the store unless they change it up.     I believe the offensive materials music, movies, books, and some what of magazines should be on the shelves of stores because lots of people are willing to buy. They all catch eyes for gossip, provokinding adds"	4	3		4	3	3	3																		
3424	2	"Regardless of if we are speaking of the religous demanding books such as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 series to be ripped from our shelves or @CAPS3 wanting to burn the @LOCATION1, books can always bring about controversy. In this country we are given the rights to freedom of speech and press, so why can anyone demand that a book be banned? Everyone in our world has different thoughts, beliefs, morals and values so why should we try to force our own views on others? We should not. Imposing our views upon others can be done just as easily through putting a controversial book on the shelves as it can by taking it off. Music, movies and magazines are no different, all express the ideas and beliefs of their respective writer, and all deserve to be accessed by anyone who desires to do so.     Books, there are lists of hundreds of banned books and honestly you could find a dozen reasons to ban any book ever written. If you ban one writers words because they speak passionately or discretely on a controversial topic, then you must ban them all, and if you have to ban the words then you must also ban the writer so that he or she cannot voice his or her opinion. If we did this then our country and our world would be without opinion, voiceless, and without a voice their is no direction and no moving forward. If the people of our world are denied the right to write a book on their opinion then what kind of world do we live in? If you can ban my words, then I can ban yours and we have both lost our voice and our chance at somehow brightening the future.      Imagine the impact if the @CAPS4 had locked away every copy of the @CAPS5 because it brought about change and controversy. Imagine a world where we had never heard of @CAPS6 or @CAPS7. It would be a would far different from our own. A world without powerful voices influencing not only our daily actions, but hundreds of years of war, love, and hate. It would be one without direction, where people are left to wonder but never to express or discuss. It would be a terrible place.     While children should not exactly be watching porn or reading '@ORGANIZATION1', they definantly should not be kept from reading, listening to, or watching anything they desire. Values and morals should be gained by reading, discovering and thinking, not forced upon us by our government or our parents. Rap music @MONTH1 have lyrics that some would consider rude but to another they @MONTH1 speak a message. To a creationist @PERSON1's views @MONTH1 seem stupid and offensive, but to an atheist they @MONTH1 be what makes sense. We should all have access to all opinions so that we can develop our own.      We should not have the values and ideas of others beaten into our heads, we should be able to develop our own through an exploration through those of others. Censorship is wrong, our government has no business in what we choose to explore and no one should be restricted by the views of another."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3425	2	"I believe everyone has their own choice when it comes to taking a book off a shelf. You should know what your picking up. If you think it might be offensive to you, then set it back on the shelf. It's as easy as that. Taking offensive articles off shevles of libraries just because a couple of people are unhappy ruins everyones opportunity on maybe finding what they were looking for.     Censorship in libraries is just uneeded. Everyone should be able to take care of themselves. Read the title before you pick up the book. It could give you a good hint on whether or not it might offend you. Children on the other hand should be overlooked by an adult just to make sure they dont pick up anything that should not be viewed as a child.      Taking offensive articles off the shelves ruins good books for everyone else. Not everyone is offended by the same material. For some it @MONTH1 be pictures. For others it could just be words. But this offensive material happens in everyday life throughout the world. It just can not be avoided. So why take it out of libraries.     If it's really offensive in any way put a warning sticker on the book. It will warn people that the book @MONTH1 contain material that @MONTH1 offend the reader of the book. It will benefit both sides of this argument. People will be less offended because they won't unexpectingly pick up a book and be offended. But the people that @MONTH1 enjoy reading the offensive books still can read them.     Everyone has their own choice when it comes to picking up a book. You should have an idea of what your picking up. Just because you made a mistake and picked up an offensive article, why take it away from others that @MONTH1 enjoy reading them. Everyone is exposed to offensive material through everyday life. So why have censorship in libraries. It's not accomplishing anything."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3440	2	"Should taking books, music, and movies off shelves of libraries even be questioned? Aa stated in our constitutuion, people have the freedom to information. People have had this luxury every since the beginning of this marvelous country. Also @CAPS1 have the choice to either pick up a type of book or not too. So to answer my question, taking types of books and movies off shelves is completely out of the question,     In the @ORGANIZATION1, it @ORGANIZATION1 that people have the freedom of speech, religion, and many others including freedom to information. Due to this reason places like libraries should have as much information as possible out on there shelves. Even if some of the conduct is inapropriate, it is still serves a way to educate. Which for children, education is largely what their childhood is for. Parents and teachers are always pushing their kids to go out, read and learn new topics other than what is being taught in the classroom or at home. If books were to be taken of the shelves, we @CAPS1 would only be depriving our youth of knowledge in the world. All books or magazines @MONTH1 benificial to some and offensive to others. However for those who would find this beneficial do we want to simply go against our @ORGANIZATION1 and deprive them of that information?     Another topic in the @ORGANIZATION1 is the freedom of choice. Even if bad books or magazines are on the shelve, children have the choice to pick them up. Parents should simply tell there kids to leave those types of materials alone and choose something else. Having books that @MONTH1 seem innapropriate to some, aren't hurting anyone by just sitting on the shelve. However some, @MONTH1 come aross a book like this and find it very interesting and decide to check it out. This action plays no effect on child who is not supossed to be viewing material like that. Finally, it is very simple to avoid this type of information, all one has to do is simply not choose to look at it and walk right by it.     As for myself, I personally as a child was not allowed to view certain types of movies, books, or magazines. For example I was restricted from watching rated @CAPS2 movies or things with innapropriate sexual actions. Since this was the case, I simply avoided those types of movies or magazines that had those types of content. For most of my childhood I did this and it was very simple. However, I don't think it would be fair to remove those types of things from other children. For the reason that it's their choice to do what ever they would like and that it has no affect on me at all. Lastly, I feel like removing certain things from libraries would be very unfair to children who have the privelage to view them.     In conclusion, removing materials,s uch as books, music, and movies is completely absurd. As I said before doing something like this, would be going against our constitutuion. The answer to solving this problem to me is black and white, children should just not pick up those types of materials end  of case"	4	4		4	4	4	4

LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS EASY AND SOME OF THOSE BOOKS WOULD HELP YOU WITH YOUR DESION MAKING. NOW THESE ARE THE REASONS WHY I THINK SO.          FIRST, HOW WOULD THE BOOK HELP OTHERS IN THE LONG RUN. I THINK IT WOULD BECAUSE SOME BOOKS TALK ABOUT THRE REAL DEAL. LIKE HOW TEENAGE GIRL BEING A  MOTHER AT A YOUNG AGE, OR HOW KIDS DONT FINISH SCHOOL AND NOW THEY ON THE STREET, IN JAIL, OR WORST. BOOKS MATERIALS LIKE THESE MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN SOMEONE LIFE OTHER THAN YOU. SO THATS ONE REASON.     SECONDLY, THESE BOOKS IS LIKE A GUIDE TO OTHERS. THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE,  IF PEOPLE READ ABOUT VOILENCE AND STUFF THEY WOULD SEE WHAT THEY DONT WANT TO  GO THREW LIKE MYSELF FOR EXAMPLE. I WAS READING THIS BOOK CALL MY HOOD. AND THIS BOOK TALK ABOUT ALOT OF STUFF THAT I HAVE SEEN WITH MY OWN EYES LIKE GANG BANGING, SEX, DRUGS, HOOD FIGHTS ETC., THAT HAPPENS IN THE REAL WORLD.

3456	2	"I believe that some materail should be remove if very offensive. I also believe that if its helping you learn then it should stay on the shelf. Everyone, has different thoughts about was is offensive or apropreate and whats not.  Also, everyone has different ideas or expectations on if books,music,movies,magazines, and so on are apropreate. Each person should read the cover of the book and so on to see if it will be apropreate for them.And the liabary should put warning stickers on  the book, so that person knows the graphic or voulgur language. Therefore, I beleive that the laibaries should put warning signs on anything to reduce less books being removed from the shelfs.   And so forth my decision is to not remove certain materail, only if offensive. The liabaries should use warning stickers on books so that person knows ahead of time about the graphic or voulgur language. I believe this will help and reduce the problems in our liabaries. Even thought alot of people will dis agree, this is what I believe should happen.  Heres why I believe this should happen. One day when I was younger just starting to read I came across a book. I was reading it to my mother then she takes the book away and gives it to the liabarean and told what happen. I guess I said a very inapropeate word and they had no idea the book had that kind of language in it. So, now everytime my mother takes my younger brothers to the liabary she makes sure the book they want are apropeate for there age group so the same incadent wont happen again.wouldnt you be the same way with your children?

Wherever you go in the world, whether you like it or not, your going to come in contact with things you don't find appropriate or you think are offensive. @TIME1 world is far from perfect. One reason i don't belive they should be removed is because it would be unconstitutional. The freedon of speech and the press was not ment to be tampered with. If a specific library thinks their articles are innapropriate, an easy solution would be to put these articles in a certain section of the library and warn people what they are.     The main reason I don't believe books, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves is becuase the world is a nasty place and books are the least of your concerns. Kids can't be sheltered their whole lifes, they need to face reality and books are a good source of that. Kids these days are resiliant and can handle 'innapropriate' content. Parents need to face the fact that their kids are going to be exposed to offensive things in @TIME1 imperfect world of ours. It's just a natural part of growing up.     Another contributing factor is that it would be unconstitutional to remove books and other articles from the shelves of @LOCATION1's libraries. When the amendments freedom of speech and press were written down they were intended to stay there. They are not guidlines that can be looked over, they are rules set in stone for @TIME1 great country. People to @TIME1 for freedom over much bigger issues than books. Who are we to tell people what they can and can't write down. People's natural opinions can't and shouldn't be governed. I think it would be a crime against @LOCATION1 to censor things in libraries.     My final reason for not censoring libraries is that it all boils down to the people running the library. If they think some of their articles are profound and innapropriate, meerly isolate them to a certain section of the library and put a warning for people to see. If people don't want to be offended they simply have to just stay away from these sections. Take responsibilty for what is in these libraries that is apparently so offending and put them in their own area and stay away from them, do not take them out completely, because who knows someone @MONTH1 want that offending book.     These are all supporting opinions why I personally do not belive libraries should be censored. @TIME1 world is far from perfect and it's not going to become perfect by censoring libraries. Plus @TIME1 act would be completely unconstitutional. Finally all the libraries have to do is exile these articles to certain areas of the libraries and slap a warning on them. If libraries were censored there would be a lot of missing information in @TIME1 world because there are many things in @TIME1 world that are 'offensive' to atleast someone"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3488	2	"With new things coming out these days, I, @PERSON1, believe that all things out in libraries should have a certain organization for certian subjects. I am not asking for any removal or destorying of books, magazines, or anything that is in the libraries but I am asking for a fair hearing of my opinion.     I would like more organization for certian things, I do know people have their own ideas about things that should be in a book. These books found in a library could bring enjoyment to people, but sometimes can offence other people.  So, with this way I would really like if there was a scale, or organization of books.      So with that, people who dont like certain subjects could easily stay away from the books that they do not like. If there is a scale factor of these books, music, magazines, or movies, you can just have a number or a letter symbolizing the certain catagories. Even though, I, personally think it is alittle worse than a different organization, it would atleast worn people of these things.     If you were to deside that either way would be better so then less complaining people would be wanting all books destroyed. I think that organizing the books in a different way would be better. This would be a lot of work but, thinking of a mother of a child could easily keep them away from books the mother would not even touch herself.     I would not like any books removed from libraries. This is because if you start taking one out of the library, that my offence someone, I believe you will start taking out more than one. With this thought I think it will come down to either everyone complaining about a certain book in the library to no library at all. So please, please think about organizing the books, magazes, movies, music, and more so then this will not happen in the future. Thank you for your time to read this, I hope you can find a way of going in to this subject more. Also, maybe publish some too, into the newspaper."	3	3		3	2	2	2																		
3490	2	"The material that someone people believe shouln't be viewed by childern, I don't believe should be removed from the library shelves just for that reason.     The library is not just for the children but also for the adults. Children are exposed to many things everyday that are not suited for them, whether it be in their home, at school, or even while their out in public. So why alter the library just for the children, when we don't even alter the public for them? I think if having certain material that isn't suitable for certain ages, then the children should be monitored closely on what they are pulling from shelves. By pulling something from a shelf just because a parent doesn't want their child to see, hear, or watch it, isn't right to the older people that come to the library.     Another reason i don't agree with removing things is because, by removing items that are not suited for a child is like saying we should move the childrens things off of shelves, because the adults have no use for them. Their are always many ways to suit both the needs of a child and the needs of an adult in a library, and still keep the children from what they shouldn't read. Most children are so amused by their own materials in the library they are not worried about the adult things. If everything a parent didn't want their child to see ws pulled from the selves, then there would be no use for the older people to come to the library. Their only custmors left would be the children, and that wouldn't be much business, because the parent's wouldn't want to stay because they wouldn't have anything to entertain them for the toe being.     There are always ways to make both side of the situatation fair. I just don't believe removing material not suited for children is the right thing to do."	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
3503	2	"Censorship is a contraversal topic. Some believe that it is necessary others would disagree. My personal opinion would be that censorship is not necessary. Everyone is entitles to what they believe, and others have to have the maturity to accept that.     Censorship is not necessary because if you are offended by some material then don't read or listen to it. It is as simple as that. Everyone can be offended by something, so if everything was removed that was found to be offensive to someone there would be nothing left. If things were organized into sections that stated how offensive the material was then it is likely that almost everything would be in the offensive section.     Because censorship is contraversal there are many different thoughts on the subject. It ranges from no censorship to complete censorship, my view be just one of many. Censorship is truely just a matter of maturity and how a person goes about dealing with the material. The only person who can let you be offened is yourself, therefore censorship is not necessary in the library people just need to be mature about it."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3505	2	"I do not think that anything is really offincive so i wouldn't really care what they have on the shelves. I do not easily get affended so i don't know what some things would be offincive but i guess that black poeple would be offincive of a rasist book?     I don't think that porn or anything involving nudety should be used in school library's because some parents are very stricked about that kind of stuff and that is very inapropriet for school. I think some parents take it over the top with whats inapropriet and what's not. Library's that are just public library's are totally diffrent and should be able to have any movies and any books. It should not be a big deal on what there about. If the people don't like it they don't need too look at it or get it.      So, i think that library's should have all diffrent kinds of books and movies. If the people don't like it then they can leave, and don't have too worry about it. That is what i have too say about that problem. I hope that this has changed or proswaded you alittle bit"	3	3		3	2	3	2																		
3506	2	"I personally think that certain materials that are found offensive should not be removed from shelves. I think this because it's parent's responsibilities to keep track of what their children read, watch, or listen to. You can't get away from things that are offensive to some and everybody has a right to do what they want.     The first reason why I don't think offensive material should be removed from shelves is because it is the parents duty to watch what their kids are doing. If parents don't want their children to observe this stuff, then they should keep it off limits. I have heard some parents claim that they didn't know what the material was like, but that is why they made warnings. That is no excuse.      The second reason for not removing offensive material is that there is no way to get away from it. Now a days, material that is offensive to some is all around. Shows, movies,and music, they all have something not suitable for all audiences. Plus children will learn about this offensive material sometime in their life anyway. If they do not hear about it in movies or magazines, they are probably hearing about it at school. These days children learn about things sooner and sooner.        The third reason offensive material should not be removed from shelves is that everyone has a right to read or listen to whatever they want. It is up to them as to what they want to watch, not everybody else. They should be able to go in a place and buy something that they want to watch and not get questioned about it.     That is why I don't think offensive material should be removed. It is the parent's responsibilities, you can't get away from it, and everybody has a right to do what they want. A way to help with this problem is to move offensive material to a higher shelf. This would make parents of younger children happy, but also the people wanting to view this material happy. This way you are not completely removing it, but making it harder for younger audiences to get to it"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3509	2	"From the point of view of a student, books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves just because of the material it contains. I read, watch, and listen to things everyday that my parents my not be too thrilled about, but it hasn't changed the person I am today. You can't escape things like drugs, sex, and other explicit things that we might not want our children reading about. It's in society. These things are everywhere, and just taking these materials off the shelves are not going to solve the problem. I think that we have a freedom to read about, listen, or watch whatever we would like, and removing these things takes away our freedom. I think that inappropriate books, music, movies, magazines, and etc., should not be taken off the shelves.      '@CAPS1' items are all over society. It's everywhere you look. Billboards, signs, books, magazine, music, television, movies, etc., but taking things like books, movies, music, and magazines off the shelves are not going to stop the inappropriate behavoir. Everyone in society is still going to act this way, whether you can stop your children from hearing about it or not. You still have commercials, billboards, etc. What are you going to do? Ban your children from life in general? No, I don't think so.      Reading, listening, learning, about this stuff isn't going to make your child a horrible person. I personally think, at a certain age, they need to know about this stuff. For example, I'm a good student, I behave well outside of school, I have good friends, and I get along with my family. I also read every single one of @PERSON1 books. All of them are about people who do drugs, are suicidal, and do sexual related things. These books are extremely good. Definitely the best books I've ever read, but reading these books hasn't changed who I am. I don't do drugs, I'm not into sexual things, so why would it hurt if I read books about it?      From my experience, reading these things are honestly kind of helpful. It takes you deeper into things. Everyone knows the basic learning you get in school, which is extremely @CAPS2. Reading these books, and listening to this kind of music, and watching these kinds of movies, takes a whole different point of view. Back to my experience with the @PERSON1 books, you read stories that are based off of her life and relationship with her daughter. Crank, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 is a trilogy of books that show the life of @LOCATION1. You see the struggle, the hurt, and the pain the family goes through as @PERSON2 starts to walk with the monster, also known as @CAPS5. Reading these books makes me realize that I don't want to ever put myself through the things @PERSON2 does to herself, and her family. It gives a whole new look on things. After reading these, I believe I won't ever do 'offensive' things.      From my experiences as a student, I don't believe taking offensive material off the shelves is necessary. It gives a deeper look into information about these things. Also, you can't escape explicit material. These things are a part of life, something you can't run and hide from. You just have to accept the fact that it's there, and it's not going away. If you think your children are going to start doing those kinds of things after reading them, talk to them about it. You can't protect your children from offensive material. At least not forever"	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
3513	2	"In libraries, is censorship truly needed? I believe there should be some censorship to some extent.     Libraries are usually pretty good at sorting things. I mean, they do use the @ORGANIZATION1 in every library I've been in. But even when they do sort the books, music, and magazines by topic, there's always something offensive that can fit in that topic as well.     I remember as a child of seven or eight going to the library all the time with my mother. I realized I was getting too old for the 'kiddy book section,' so I ventured forth to places I've never been before. Any isle of books was open to anyone, I felt that I had the world in the palm of my hand.      Most of the books were too mature of a read for me anyways, butt I still looked through them all. I mean, it was something very new to me; almost like an adventure. Then, I came across the music.     There were so many inappropriate titles, cover-arts, and even names of bands. But this perked my curiosity. I remember thinking to myself, 'were books this way too?' I soon found out yes, they were. There were even doctor books with graphic images. The worst were books with cuss words that I found. Innocence in the library was gone.     I think libraries should have a different section for older, more mature people; not including children. Some people loves books, and will open any book just to read or look at the pictures. Libraries need to realize that. I was once that little kid who opened the wrong book, at the wrong time.    In conclusion, I think libraries should have at least some censorship. I understand that people enjoy the books and music that once terrored me, but I think there should be something done about it"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3514	2	"The quote from the author Katherine Paterson is very true , I believe that if we were to remove everything in the world that we took offense to then there really wouldn't be anything left in the world to gaze upon.      I remember when I was younger and  I had just gotten off of school one evening and had decided to go downtown to our town's library , I needed a book for my school project on the holocaust and I remember one of the ladies working there telling me that the book should be removed from the shelves because it was offensive to jewish people. I had at first been a little bit outraged that she would tell the person checking out the book that it should be taken from the shelves mostly because since I'm the one going to read it why would you whine about it to me in the first place plus it's more offensive to tell the person that they shouldn't check out the book that they want to read then it is to the jewish.      Another time something like this occured was when I was in @ORGANIZATION1 and one of the customers was complaining about some religious magizine that they shouldn't be aloud to sell because some of the articles were very offensive to people of certain religions. The customer who complained was taken straight up to the managers office because he actually ripped a couple of the magazines in half , talk about having issues , anyway the customer was kicked out to say the least and had to pay for the magazines they'd destroyed as well.      There has been a lot of times in my life where someone has decided to speak out about their dislikes of something and although they put up a good argument they're lacking in a couple of important things , one of which is the fact that most of the things people complain that need to be taken from the shelves have something to do with history and another thing is there are not enough people complaining about it.      But the quote by Katherine Paterson is like a knock at the door , it speaks of what could happen if we removed everything from our shelves that are offensive to others and when I read that quote the first thing that pops into my head is another quote , ' @CAPS1 speak louder than words '"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3515	2	"My views on cencorship @MONTH1 not  be what others believe. With a good understanding of what the majority of people would call innapropriate, evaluating what books should be placed on the shelfs is easier. Although many people @MONTH1 think that a certain book is appropriate, others @MONTH1 disagree. That's why creating a rating system would be best.     With a rating system of books, movies, magazines, and other materials in a library, parents would have a better understanding of what they want their child to read or watch. If there is vulgar language inside of the book, it could be labeled with a rating and an explanation of why the book is rated the way it is. That way, if there are complaints of the item, the library would not be blamed.      I personally don't think that getting rid of materials because of others' complaints should occur. I believe that the books could be kept, but labeled or even placed on a different section of shelves to reference that they @MONTH1 be more innapropriate than the normal. What happens when a college student needs a book that is mandatory for his class and the book is banned because of 'innapropriate usage'? There is no way of making everyone completely satisfied, but with this system a lot of issues would be resolved.     My views on cencorship @MONTH1 not be what others believe, but taking away perfectly written books is not right. Disagreement isn't the easiest thing, but just because it's hard doesn't mean you have to give up. The rating system would decrease the complications and help others to be more free with their decisions"	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
3524	2	"Who is to label a book offensive? What one might find appauling, others @MONTH1 find a novel or passage to be rather interesting. All books and other arts were created to be read and enjoyed by people. Libraries banning books, music, movies, or magazines seems unreasonable since there is such a wide variety of people and their interests.          Books such as The @CAPS1, The @CAPS2's @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have been removed from many library shelves. Though people @MONTH1 check these books out, many others find them either offensive or think they should not mix with every day books. I have read a decent amount of each of the above readings, and have found the books to be full of remarkable things which have taught me a lot. If books are banned from libraries, it almost seems as if they're limiting our education.      Why would a book be published, or written for that matter, if we were not intended to read it? Any book could be offensive to any one person. Any article, song, or film could be offensive. But, there will always be a crowd it appeals to. And that crowd deserves to enjoy every last word. Censorship in libraries has gone on too long, it is time for the world to freely take part in the literature that interests them.               The solution to library censorship is the division of books into categories and sub-categories. First by subject, down to the author. Therefore, books that @MONTH1 be offensive are listed as such, but are still available to those who want to read them.      Censorship in libraries takes away from individual freedom every day. People should be able to read what they enjoy and not be ridiculed for it. All books are written to be read, and with the division of such books, everyone can agree upon this: books help us grow. Growth is not meant to be limited, nor is freedom."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3525	2	"People have a choice on the types of literature they want to read wether it offends them or not the chose to read it. Books should not be removed from the shelves of libraries.They need to try to avoid the books that @MONTH1 be offensive to them. Now if they cant then thats not the libraries fault. Books should not be removed for many reasons.     One of the many reasons books should not be removed is because they know the risk they take when entering a library, and that's their decision that they are making and sometimes decisions have consequences. When and if they are offended, they will know the types of books that offened them so they would just have to do a little better job of avoiding those books.     Another reason would be the libraries dont know what offends people it can be one little thing in a book but that doesn't mean that book should be removed from the shelfs. Also just cause one person tihnks its offensive doesn't mean that others will. People arn't all offended by the same thing some people are offended by little things, meaning they're offended easily, some arn't offended so easy, that means it make take more serious things than a book to offend a person.     Another reason books shouldnt be removed is because students need them for projects and school assignments. Some school assignments require you getting a little offended exspecially if your african american and you get an assignment on slavery or something during that time. But we need to learn about past experiences and our history and we couldnt do that if some people are trying to remove some of those books from the shelf. You @MONTH1 get offended but there is no reason to remove that book that others will need at sometime.Find another way to solve that problem.     There are other ways to solve problems like these such as tagging the books with a yellow small sticker so it would warn people that the book offended someone. There is no need to completly remove the book. Another solution would be to maybe seperate the books, meaning put the books in a diffrent location of the library if the get more than a couple complaints of being offensive. Also when someone check out a book the librarian can warn them that the book has been tagged with a yellow sticker and its possible that it @MONTH1 offend them. Thats why removing books from shelves arn't cause for."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3531	2	"One @MONTH1 walk into a library, look over at a magzine rack and think, '@CAPS1 is that in the young adult section, the content of that book is not age appropriate?' In many libraries, some books are not censored and catagorized the way they should. In some of the reading material, one might not even realize that some inappropriate things are in it. Supervision of children and young adults are not always looked upon, and some of these people might not even know what they are checking out. Censorship needs to be pushed more in libraries.      In most libraries, the catagories for books are children, young adult, adult books by genere, magazines, and music, but what needs looked upon is what is on the inside covers of those books. Some magazine articles are not appropriate for some teens, even if it does claim to be age appropriate. I remember when I was fourteen, I read a series that was related to colors off the color weel. Each one covered a different topic such as suicide, alcholism, drugs, sex, same sex dating, and jealousy. Looking back on it, I am surprised I was allowed to check them out at the library. A fourteen year old didn't need to read books on such heavy topics.Also, language in books and music maybe unappropriate for children, and @MONTH1 be distasteful and disrespectful for some adults. The catagories need to be catogorized even more, so people further know what they are getting into when checking out a book or magazine.      When a child goes up to check out a book they found, a librarian sometimes doesn't even pay attention to the book they are getting, they simply check it out. Libraries should have a rating system like movies do. Generally people would not let their ten-year-old go to a movie rated @NUM1, @CAPS2 or that is unrated, so @CAPS1 would they let their child get a book holding the same content? If books had a rating system, that ten-year- old would not get their hands on a book rated '@CAPS2' or '@CAPS4' for mature.     In libraries there is not as much supervision as their needs to be. I am aware that libraries are not day-care center and the librarians are not babysitters, but there also needs to be stricter guidelines, because some people are not fully aware of what their children or what they, themselves, are reading. For example, a thirteen-year-old girl wants to check out @CAPS5 magazine, because her best friend's older sister gets it. The girl's mother allows it because it probably won't be too bad and she assumes her daughter wants to look at the pictures of new clothes and trends. What the mother @MONTH1 not realize is in the middle of the magazine contains an article about sex and protection, and that @MONTH1 open a whole new world for the little girl. Even though the mother shouldn't have had let her daughter check out the magazine, if the guidelines were stricter at the library the girl might have never have read that article. Even if librarians had to check or scan a person's library card to make sure they can be in the section or be reading a certain book, it would be protecting many more people then it would be hurting.     If libraries censored books better, then children and teens @MONTH1 not be reading things not age appropriate to them. I'@CAPS4 not saying that books should be removed off the shelf, just maybe put up higher, and be watched over more carefully"	4	3		4	4	4	4																		
3534	2	"No, I don't think that books or any other material should be taken off shelves in libraries just because some people might find them offensive.  I think that if a parent sees something that they do not want their child reading, then it is in their right to not allow that child read it, but it is unfair to take it off the shelf entirely.  That book that has been marked 'offensive' could have been a way for another person to learn about that book and possibly gain something out of it.  There are some non-fiction books out there that can marked as 'offensive', and they are just that non-fiction.  It is something that really happen and anyone can learn something from it by reading it, and to take it away would be taking away the knowledge that another person could have obtained.      I believe that in a library people should have a choice to read what they choose and not have it ripped off the shelf just because parents don't want their child reading it.  I think that if they do not want their child to read it, then the parents can tell that child that they don't want them reading that and then everybody wins.  I know that I have read some non-fiction books that would be marked by some people as offensive, but with that book I also learned much about the topic at hand.  To take away that book would be showing that you care only about how it might be offensive to some people and not how it could help extend the knowledge of another.  If we are to take away every book that might have a racial slur here or an act of violence there, what would we have left our children to read and to learn from.  They read these books and they can find out how that racial slur or act of violence as hurt someone emotionaly and physicaly, and that they should never do it in fear of the concicence that they might have to face later on.       Overall, I think that the books and other material in libraries should be kept on the shelves, and if someone finds it offensive or anything else they shouldn't read it and not deprive someone of that knowledge.  We live in a world today where education is everything, and we think that everyone should have an education.  But if we take away every book that a person does not like then what do we have left to learn from."	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
3539	2	"Author Katherine Paterson proclaims, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work i abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' A controversial issue in today's society are people's conflicting views on censorship in libraries. Many types of books, magazines, music, movies, and much more have been banned from being put on the shelves of libraries because of their content. From personal experience, observations, and reading of the issue censorship should not be allowed in libraries.     The shelves of libraries will soon be empty if censorship continues. Certain readings, and types of entertainment have already begun to disappear one by one. It is understandable if one person does not agree with the material being placed into these books, but why should they ruin the entertainment for everyone else? From my own experience, people in my elementary school were not able to enjoy reading a popular series of books at that time period. Since I went to a @CAPS1 school, the priest at the corresponding church during that time decided he did not agree with the content in this certain series of books. As a result, he took charge and made the staff of the school remove those books from our school library, and no student was allowed to come to school with one of those types of books. If it had been up to him, he would have decided to go ahead and take out all those books from everywhere in the world. Just because one individual does not agree on the content of that book, they should not be able to have the power to banish the lovely leisure for the rest of the population.     Authors and artists of books, movies, and music have the freedom to put into them whatever they choose. It should not be up to their audience to decide whether or not it is appropriate. The concept is quite simple; if the reader or viewer does not think they would agree with the work, then they should not spend their time to read or view the pieces at hand. Just because they might not completely think what the content entails is necessarily appropriate, someone else might enjoy it. Censorship is wrong for this very reason. The creators of their work are most likely proud of what they have accomplished and would like their audience to enjoy it to. The audience they are trying to appeal to @MONTH1 not have the same taste in style as someone who the work was not necessarily meant to have their own opinion on the matter. Books should not be able to be taken out of libraries because what one person might think is not appropriate to be placed into public, another person @MONTH1 enjoy thouroughly. Likewise, if the content of a work of literature does not appeal to an individual then it should just simply not be read by that person. As humans, there is the freedom of choice as to what people would like to read, and what they would not like to indulge in. So make the correct choice in deciding what you want to read, and do not ruin the enjoyment for many others.     In a great deal of different types of literature censorship is touched on by the authors. For example, in the popular prize-winning novel, @CAPS2 @NUM1, books are burned, or 'censored' because they contain information people should not be aware of in that period of time. However, in today's world books are a major type of entertainment and are important in the knowledge of everyone. Books provide so much information on almost every subject known to human-kind that it would be such a dramatic loss if now books were burned if caught reading one. Paterson does point out that everyone has a right to their own opinion of this matter, but if people do not take the right approach to solving this situation, there will be no books left on library shelves for several generations after to enjoy for themselves. Every individual has their own right to be able to read books and absorb all the wonders and knowledge they contain.     As a result of the growing awareness of censorship in today's libraries, people @MONTH1 never be able to enjoy certain types of books, movies, music, and magazines. From my own past experiences on this situation I know how wrong it is to take away someone's own privelage to enjoy types of literature. People should not have a say whether something is appropriate or not to be taken out of libraries. If the individual does not simply agree with the specific content of the work then they need to accept it and move on instead of causing millions of others to not enjoy it. Also, from different types of reading, censorship has definitely become a serious issue, but it should be abolished. Keep the books that are on library shelves now for many generations to come and enjoy for themselves"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3549	2	"Libraries hold many books and movies such as fiction, nonfiction, historical, fantasy, and adventure.  These books have many different styles and portrails and many of these @MONTH1 be takeno offensive but that doesn't mean that they can just be taken off the shelf.     One book that comes to my mind that can be seen as offensive is 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2'.  This book talks about blacks as slaves and how they should be whipped for being let go and it call them @ORGANIZATION1 offensive names yet it is a classic and is in almost every book store or library in the country. Why, because it was written back when slavery was legl and slaves were treated as property not people.    A movie that many people have seen recently is slumdog @CAPS4.  This movie has a boy from a slum being tortured because he knows the answers to the questions on the gameshow '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 to be a @CAPS4?'.  Many indians @CAPS2 are smarter could be offended by this because they are saying if you grow up in a slum you can't be smart.  But, people blow it off because it is a movie so it isn't real.       But if you go to somepeople and ask them about these books are movies some will say they are @ORGANIZATION1 good others might be offended so they might as weel stay on the shelfs.  The book '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' is a book about the civil war could this be scene as offensive showing the thoughts of both sides saying slavery is good and bad at the same time yet it is another classic and will stay on the book shelfs.     So books in libraries shouldn't be censroed because of being offensive to a race, sex, or group; they should stay on the shelf because every books other tahn some childrens books have something offensive.  Thus if we took books off the shelfs for being offensive their would be nothing to read except for 'The @ORGANIZATION1'!"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3551	2	"In my opinion,  I do not believe that anyone has a choice in what children or any other age group chooses to read. It is not up to the general public to say what is right or wrong. When society says that every single child is not allowed to read a certain book, or listen to a certain song just because it is found offensive to some people. There are laws against restricting what a person can or can not view. There is a level of media that is not as appropriate as it should be but that does not mean it has to go away completely. Some of the reasons society can not sensor everything are because of the fact that not everone is offended by everything, it is up to the parent of the child to say what is right or wrong, and lastly individuality is comprimised if the choices we have are limited.      When someone gets offeneded by the media that is out there, that does not neccessarily mean that another person is also offended. When I do not like a video, or a book, or any other type of content, someone else should not have that content censorded because my opinion is in the way of what they enjoy. I know that personally I would not want someone to take away my favorite book so my child could not read it. Content that is out in the public will always be unsafe to read by someone else's views. Just like I will not believe in what other people believe in, but, I will see that it is valued by others and should not remain a censored topic.          Books that are considered inappropriate, should be decided to has censoreship by the parents of a young child. Decisions like that should not be left up to a group of people that has opposite views. Whe children are growing up and are taught the values that know today, it is their parents that teach them and not a society full of people which have different kinds of opinions. There is a saying by an author and it says 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf' and all that means if we all would have the power to remove a book or any other content from the shelf that we do not like then their would not be any books left. I believ in that saying and I also believe that many others will as well.      Individualaity is when one person has differnt traits of feelings than another human being. We all have choices of the books we read and the musice we listen to and that is why we all have individuality. When people start to thnk that they are allowed to remove a certain song or book because that is not what they want other people to see, then everyone will do the same and no one would have that song they enjoy or the traits that make them differnt because they are the only one that likes that song. If there were not any of us left on this earth that has something that they enjoyed and no one else that also enjoyed the same thing, then we would all be pretty boring. I have learned from experience that being the person that has something different about them is not a bad thing and is actually a good thing in some cases.      Also from experience I have learned that a boom that is no longer on the shelf that someone has removed is not a good feeling. I would not want the same happen to all of the other books in the world. It is a very good thing to practice the art of understading, and to have an open mind when it comes to a certain material that another person happens to enjoy. In the future, when I find a book that @MONTH1 not be a book I would want my children to read, I will just let the topic go and remember that everyone has their own opinions. So in conclusion I just want to let everyone know that books that are seen as inappropriate or offensive to one person, @MONTH1 be seen as a good thing to another."	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
3571	2	"In society today, people take things in very many different ways. So things that might help one person, @MONTH1 offend other.      In libraries, there are different kinds of books; fiction, non fiction..(etc). So if you dont like a particular book, maybe you should try looking in a different area. I do not think books should be removed from the shelf because the book has offened a few people.      We are blessed to live in @LOCATION1, where we have freedom of speech. So authors have freedom to write what they would like to. They work long hard hours getting a book ready to be published and then someone wants to take it off the shelf becasue it offened a few people? I do not think that is right.     '@CAPS1 man's junk is another man's treasure.' I think this quote goes along with this topic very well, because the book @MONTH1 not mean something to one person but it @MONTH1 mean the word to someone else.      You never know what people @MONTH1 need to hear. Maybe an alcoholic is at a point in his/her life and is ready to change, and someone has a book about a recovering alcoholic. Now, this kind of book @MONTH1 offend a few people, but it @MONTH1 save a family, a friendship or maybe even a life.      Take @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for intance, her journal is now a book. Now this @MONTH1 offend a few people that might have been thereor maybe don't like @CAPS4 @CAPS5, but her story has the right to be told. Yes, there is violence in it, and i understand that maybe you don't want your @NUM1 year old to hear about how they use to treat @CAPS4 @CAPS7 women, but the story has the right to be told, and should be told.      I do not think that the librarian has the right to take a book off the shelf at the library, just because it has offened a few. There are lots of different kinds of books, if the books you are reading offend you, look for a different type of book"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3574	2	"Practice @CAPS1 You @CAPS2     The @LOCATION1 is considered one of the greatest countries in the world because it is a free country. In the @DATE1's people migrated here to escape the control that their government had in their homeland. In @LOCATION2 we practice freedom of speech. If we censor materials like books, music, movies, etc. it would defeat the entire purpose of @LOCATION2 and it's @ORGANIZATION1.     Everyone has their own personality with likes and dislikes. Not everyone likes the same music or is interested in reading the same subject, thats why its wonderful that their is a variety of everything. If you start banning or censoring certain things then how will people learn? There is nothing wrong with learning about negative things because that teaches people lessons so they know @CAPS1 or @CAPS1 not to do if in that situation. When you censor 'bad things' it creates naive thinkers, which only leads to discrimination.      I agree that for children there should warnings for material that parents @MONTH1 find offensive. For example, movies have ratings for different age groups, and books could do the same. Of course its up to the parents if they want to follow the recommendations but banning something all together is not neccessary.     I personally learned a lot of things from @CAPS1 I've seen on television. Whats on television @MONTH1 be considered 'street smart' education but that is good. Today we live in a scary and violent society, so being 'street smart' is an advantage. If television was censored then people would not know @CAPS1 to do in a bad situation because they have never experienced or seen of it before.     If books, movies, magazines, music, etc. are removed from shelves then @LOCATION2 is not practicing @CAPS1 it preaches to the many of people who come here in search of freedom."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3577	2	"Many people have many different thoughts and beliefs. Some people @MONTH1 believe that a movie or song needs to be removed, but others @MONTH1 disagree, and nobody wants the things they enjoy to be taken away.     If there was a book on a shelf in a bookstore that you didn't agree with and thought should be removed, and you removed it, then you are taking away from someone who @MONTH1 enjoy that book. If everyone removed things from life that they didn't enjoy, then there would be very little to enjoy.    For example, I personally love horror movies. I love the thrill you get from a horror movie and how they can make you jump even though it's just a movie screen. I'm sure there are people in this world who think horror movies are wrong. If those people were allowed to just remove them forever, I, and many other people, would be sadly dissapointed. I also love video games. Video games are a huge part of my life, and I know for a fact that there are people who highly disagree with some of the content of them. If people could take video games away because they didn't agree with them, i would be crushed.     I am also aware that people @MONTH1 just be worried about their children watching movies, listening to songs, or reading books that are not appropriate for them. I understand that the parents want their children to be supervised, but removing the books, movies and songs is not exactly the answer. Movies and books can easily be censored. Many movies and songs have language filters and some movie programs now have parental options that allow the parents to decide what movies they want to allow their children to watch. Parents can also supervise their children when they download music onto an ipod or phone, and depending on where they are bought, books and magazine's @MONTH1 require parental consent. Video games also require parental consent depending on the rating of the game.      We can't just go around removing everything we dont like, because it is not fair to those who @MONTH1 like it. We live in a world with many different ideas, thoughts and beliefs, and we all need equal right to share them"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3580	2	"I dont think books that would affend people should be on the shelf. some of the books that maybe on the shelf @MONTH1 hurt some ones feelings. But i also think people should beable to read what they want to read. many people wouldnt read a book that they think would affend them.      There are many kinds of books not all book will be bad or affend people. but books that are not apropriot for young kids or teens shouldnt even be in school librarys. In public librarys i think it should be ok to have every type of book. and have different books in different place's. like haveing the young adalt section and the adalt and children section.     I think screton books should be sold in book stores like i dont think they should have inapropeiout books in children book store's. They should have a different store for certain books. And parents should monitor what there children are reading and take part in the book by helping them understand what the book is saying.      There are lots of parents that dont really care about what there kids read, and to me that's there busness but my apenioun is that they shouldn't let there kids read what they want. Parents should be with the child when he/she is picking out a book. But if it is a teen @DATE1 and older, i think they would be old enough to choise what they want to read. by the time they are that age they have matured enough to read and understand things much easer"	3	3		3	2	3	2

Or what if you liked the choice of what the place had, but someone else didn't? Should they have the right to take it away just because they don't approve?                                            What if @NUM1 people came into a library with  @NUM2 books, magazines, music and movies, and @NUM3 of them did not like any part of the library and wanted every book, magazine, music, and movie taken out? Even if the @NUM4 others loved what they saw? Do you think it's fair just because some people do not approve, that they get to pick? I do not think it would be fair for just one person to be able to have the right to do that. If something is that offensive to that many people, they should be mature enough to ignore what they see and find what they like.                                                                 If someone did not like your house and said I don't want to see it should they have to demolish it just like nothing?                The world would have never ending chaos if people had too much power to change things. It could only get worse.              I have encountered problems between people that do not agree on throwing out or keeping it. One solution could be just move it to a different area where if certain people would like to look at the item they could, otherwise have  separate parts of a room that are divided into all ranges.                                       If you read this and think to yourself about how many different options you have to get along and not have to worry about offending people you will realize that no certain person should be able to take that one thing that you would like to keep to enjoy and be happy."	3	3		3	3	3	3

No, i don't think that the stuff should be removed from the shelves just becuase someone thinks or takes it to be offensive. Let's say this ok if we had everybody go and say that this book is offensive, or I don't think this movie should be on this shelve because i think it's offensive or this or that then we wouldn't have anything to wacht, lissin to, or even read. I under stand that yes people do have rights and there believes on something but it doesn't mean that they have any say so on what should stay or what should go.           If we let people do this than nobody would be abel to wacht, read, play,  or even lissin to for fun. Us people used these thing for haveing something to keep us intertaned. Let's say this ok we all know how littel children have thier emanginashon and they used that to keep them intertaned just like us older people used books, music, movies, and ect to keep us intertand. Well if we don't have this stuff than we would be lost and won't know what to do with out that stuff. Just's think of our littel kids if we take there emanginashon away than they would be lost and hoples because that's how they learn and grow up.     We people used this every day use to not onley keep us intertaned but to also help us learn more about what every we need to learn about to survive in every day life. See in ways we are not so diffrent from our chiledren at all realy. they used what every they find or see to keep them intertaned and for enjoiment. If people realy thought about what they are realy going to do by removing something from the shelves than they would regreat that what they did was stupied because now they don't have anything to read, lissin to, or even wacht. I my own self had experience on what it's like to have something like that polled down from the shelves befor and it's realy not cool at all fore that to happen. Takeing something off the shelfs that is alittel bit offensive doesn't meen that it should be tooken off the shelves.     I think that if people who took something off the shelves just becase one person thought that it was offensive if wrong and should not take somthing down that maby other people like. I mean just look at what the thing is talking about first and see if it's offensive to you or not and maybe it's something that people could learn from. Taking something down befor even reading it your self is stupied on be hafe of your part becasue maby other people like and maby you like it who knows. I just think that people should realy think befor they go and take something off the shelves with out haveing alote of people giveing you a bad coment on it befor just taking one persons opean on it."	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
3591	2	"Offensive or @CAPS1?     Who can truely say a book, movie, music, or magazine is truely offensive. There are some of the obvious movies that completely make fun of or taunt someone's personal views as a religion or lifestyle but is a book about a wizarding world really that offensive?     While growing up I had a friend who was very religious. Her parents would never let her read the @ORGANIZATION1 books by @PERSON1. At the time I didn't understand why she wasn't able to read such fantastic books. Now that I'm older I understand that her parents believe what is in 'The @CAPS2' and nothing more. Make believe and imagination was @CAPS1 a suitable thing fpr their child to read. For many families, though the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 series is nothing but a different world in which they can set themselves free from the real world. Should a book that many people love and adore be taken off shelves because some families are offended? I personally don't think they should.      While my family loves the books and movies some families don't. That is their lifestyle and their opinion. Everyone has an opinion, and if we took out everything in this world that could offend someone we would be left with nothing. Movies would be boring, stories would @CAPS1 be interesting, and there would be no music.      If our world was based off of the opinions of others and making everyone happy we would @CAPS1 have music. Music is a way for someone to release their soul. The different sounds of music are based off generations. My mother's generation was based on @CAPS3 @CAPS4' @CAPS5 and mine is of @CAPS6, @CAPS7&@CAPS8, @CAPS9. So what would really happen if all the offensive materials were taken off the shelves of a public library or say a @ORGANIZATION2. The shelves would be blank. Empty shelves would be a horrible look.      Everyone is offended by something. I'm offended by the rape scences in movies but some people believe in some situations it makes a movie better. My friend's family is offended by the make believe world of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, and I believe that some where out in our world there is another world, a wizarding world as a matter of fact.      People believe in many different things and like many different things. I've never met one person who is exactly like me, because there is @CAPS1 one. I'm an individual like everyone else and if the things I liked were taken off a shelf because someone was offended then my life would be boring because I wouldn't have the things I enjoy. In some cases some offensive things should be taken off shelves but who am I to say it should be, because there is someone out there who believes it should be on the shelves of @LOCATION1"	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
3592	2	"As said before there would be no books for anyone to read if everybody removed what they felt was offensive. The libraries would have a very watered down material base and there would be no reason to use this place anymore. Some material is not suitable for young ages there is much from advanced material that can be learned; thus the libraries should sperate their books only as they do already.     Some material does seem to advanced for others but these materials are needed to advance academic gwroth. Some people should think that school should not read @PERSON1 due to racism in the south. This was true history so there should be no restrictions to that sort of book. If there were those soprt of restrictions then schools would lack much of histories best literature.     Just as the movies do for the gerneal population, @CAPS1 is for @NUM1 and up while @NUM2 is for @NUM3 and up. These are good standard that keep the youth from seeing what they are not yet ready for. This concept should be used the same way in these libraries where there seems to be a problem.Yet this is already done in libraries. There would be no reason to break these sectiopns up more then they already are broken. There is the young adult section, adult, and youth. Those are the main catagories that most perople want sperate due to offensivce material such as drugs, sex, and alchohol.     Much of the media that is public today is censered and that benefits much of the youth, but there is a point where the public needs to realize that sheltering the outh can stunt them academically"	3	3		3	3	3	3

If we start taking offensive books off the self then every body coming in would be taking @NUM1 books off the self.  Then with in two days there would be not books left.     If we do not have any books then are eyes would be bad. We should not take books off the selves because of some people like to read.  If people do not like the books in the library then they should not go to the library to get books.     This is why people should not take offensice books off the selves.

He listeans to his friends talking about drinking alchol and how much fun is it. He thinks it sounds amazing to drink. He dosnt no something is bad about it or not. No one every told him. So he starts to drink an dlater died of alchol posing. Now, you dont want this to ever happen to someone who is very close to you. If people are to scared to talk about the bad things in life. Like sex, drugs, etc..Then they should make books and movies to show how bad these thing are. There should not be censorship in libraries. Some of you @MONTH1 say 'well there to young they cant hanndle these things yet.' @CAPS1 your opinon you should think of there maturity level, aslo they can learn from other peoples mistakes, and it would educate people.     How do you tell on someones maturity level? There are many ways to tell. If you talk to someone about sex and they start to laugh and make jokes then there not very mature. But, you cant asociate that every @NUM2 year old is immature. Many people @MONTH1 take this as a serious thing. Others @MONTH1 not but, they still will be able to see them in there own way. Putting censorship in libraries would not be a good idea.     Many topics in books, movies, music, magazines, etc.. @MONTH1 have inapropte things in them. Like sex, drugs, drinking, bad language. Should all these things be taken out on libraires and off the shevles? @CAPS1 a hard question to answer. But, what you can answer from that is it would allow people to learn from there mistakes. If theres a movie and a guy and he is doing drugs and later dies. People could assume that drugs kill you. But, what about the other thing? Its hard to show how its bad to say an offensive word to someone, that they herd on the radio. But, when they here that word or read about something or watch. They can ask about it and we can say that saing those things or doing them can be offensive.      Now, can you educate someone from letting the person listean, read , or watch about something offensive or etc..? It depends on the person. But, you can educate someone about the subject matter. No matter how offensive the topic is. We should teach people about them. If we dont, its bound to repeat it self. Say if we censor the holocaust becuase of how horifying it was. No one would no about it and we would most likely repeat the holocaust. Censoring certain things a library would not be that good of an idea.      Ceratin people can hanndle talking about certain subjects. Its not always a good thing to censor offensive subjects. We need to teach people about these thing to educate them, and also so they can learn on what has been done and not repeat it, also some people can handle these materials, they just need to have a high maturitly level. These are some reasons why there should not be censorship in libraries and other places"	4	4		4	4	4	4

So, since everyone has a different opinion about what is offensvie and what isn't, who's to say what can and can't be in the library?     When I was little, my grandma would take me to the library almost every @DATE1. I noticed that she tried to keep me from getting certain books and was fine with others. My @CAPS1 did the same thing, but they had different opinions on what was okay for me to read and what wasn't. Grandma wanted me to get religious books and @CAPS1 was okay with that and things like '@CAPS2 the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5', and '@PERSON1'.      Even at home, everyone's opinion is very different. For instance, when it comes to music at my house; @CAPS1 likes country, @CAPS7 likes metal, my brother likes alternative, my unlcle likes rock, and I like a combonation of all of it.      That just does to show how different people have different opinions; some more strict than others.

There are many offensive books and thangs on the shelvs. I wouldnt want my kid or anybody els kid reading offensive books. So lets get rid of all the bad stuff or atleast filtyer it all.     I beleve any book, movie and magazines that have alot of profanity or bad pictures in them should be removed or not be able to be cheked out to a certion age. If they wana keep teh books on the shelves they should make it where you have to be in high school and have a permsion slip to get the books. Removing teh  books and thangs complitly @MONTH1 cause to much troubl so we should defntly make sure the kid is a certian age and has permsion.

There is alot going on in socaty now a days that badly influnce children. They do not need to read about how guys rob places and are crimanals. I think thats why we have so much of a probly to day becouse evry one sees it at a young age and they want to be lyk that wehn tehy get older but that is a very bad thing. They do not need books and movies that make it worse on them and make them think bad things are good.

3625	2	"Censorship at  the library is not needed at all times. It is the parents who should take the books away from the kids. It isn't the libraries job to tell people what to do. There are certin cases when it's needed though.     It's the parent's job to tell the kids what to do. They are the ones in charge of the kids. they are the ones who should tell teach them right from wrong. They are the ones who are raising the kids, not the library. Other wise, they parents are having their job done for them.     The libraries have the right to get what ever books they want as long as there isn't anything really bad in them. I do get it if they pull off books, movies, and magizines for adults, but if there is one little word in there, people will just have to get over it.     Isn't that why people are wanting classic books, such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2's @CAPS3' and 'The @CAPS4 of @ORGANIZATION1,' changed? Because black people find it offensive? It's not rignt. People are trying to rewrite history; to sugar-coat the truth. Well, the books are like the real world. People aren't always going to be nice to you. They can be down right mean some times. The whole world is just corupted.     There shouldn't be a problem with just one little bad word in great works of liturature. People will cuss you out if they feel like it while in books, the language limited to one or two bad words. They shouldn't be trying to change great books because the minority find it offensive. The library shouldn't be the ones who tell us what we can and can not read. The library shouldn't censor their books."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3627	2	"I belive that the view on censorship in libraries are fine as they are for many reasons. The main reasons that i belive censorship in libraries are fine are that almost everything in the library are for people to learn about weather they read it or watch a movie about it. Another reason is that if they took everything that was offecsive or unliked then there would be a lot less information for people to learn about in libraries.     I agree with Katherine Paterson in her quote because it means that if we took away every book that someone found offensive then there would be no books left. Every person has different things that offend them and it would not be possible to remove everything from the library that offended someone. For example, if someone wanted to learn about a historic war from the past, but if someone was offended by the war because they lost a family member or friend to it, should the piece of writing be taken away? Libraries are a place that someone can go to, to learn about something. They hold a lot of information about many different subjects that people go to learn about even if it @MONTH1 be offensive to some people. If someone doesn't like something or finds it offensive then they should just leave it on the shelf and move on because someone else might learn something important from it. There are things in life that people need to be opened to or informed about even though they @MONTH1 not always be plesent. Libraries are the place that people get introduced to these things and if these things are removed then where will people go to be informed about this information.     To sum it all up, yes there are things in libraries that some people @MONTH1 find offensive but other people @MONTH1 learn from it and it would be unfair to take this information away from everyone else. A library is a place to go to learn about different things and should alway have information on different subjects and topics. Many people have learned things from a library that have affected their lives and will keep learning more things as long as they are still opened to a wide source of information."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3628	2	"Censorship in Libraries      I believe that there should be censorship in libraries. In @DATE1's society there are many kids who are hurting and are getting into bad things. There are somethings kids just should not see. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive.      Censorship in libraries can steer kids in the right direction. Odds are, if a kid sees his role model on the front of a movie case smoking a cigarette, then that kid is probably going to become curious about smoking. This has happened to me before. I once saw this kid that I looked up to drinking, and I almost took up drinking myself, but because I had the right peers, I didn't. The point is that when kids see someone they look up to doing a certain thing, it has a great impact. If that movie case is sensored then that kid would never even think about smoking because of his role model.     Every parent is worried about their kid getting into trouble with the law, right? Some of the movies that a kid can get at a library has the actors doing illegal things in it. A kid will see this and then they will probably think it is cool and go out and do the same thing. I have seen plenty of movies that made me want to go out and do what they did in the movie. What if that thing they see in a movie is murder? It maybe crazy to think that a kid would go out and murder someone because he saw people do it in a movie, but it could happen. A couple years ago I can remember reading an article in the newspaper about a kid shooting his father in the head. This kid was only six years old, but he thought that playing with guns was safe because he saw them do it in the movies.      Censorship can take some of the stress off of some parents' backs. Parents stress all the time about where their kids are, what they are doing, who they are with, and so on. If the library censors some of the music and movies that kids watch then his parents will not have to worry too much about him going off and doing bad things because he sees his peers do it. This makes parents feel good and confident in their child's life.      Finally, offensive movies are actually offensive, whether this be to the kid himself, the parents, or the audience that the movie is targeting. Keeping offensive movies censored can relieve a lot of hate in a kid's life. I say this from experience. In movies we always see the smart kids getting picked on and it seems like the athletes get all of the attention. Well I am sort of considered that smart kid. I feel that, because of some of the movies my peers have watched, they find it okay to pick on me. This creates hate inside of their hearts, all because censorship was not used.      In conclusion it has to be obvious that I feel censorship should be used in libraries. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive. With censorship, all of these things can be accomplished. This is not only helpful to the kids, but the parents as well. In my experience, censorship is a good thing to have."	4	4		4	4	4	4

If they think the book is bad then don't read it.First off a book should not be banned from a libary.It is just a book.Second the only reason they would want to band a book is because people like to start drama. Third reason every could be offense to somebody.          First off they should not band a book just because people don't like it.If your child read an adult book that is good for them, for reading those big words.And if they just happen to see a naked picture it is not the end of the world. I bet it is not the first and it won't be the last.     Second some people would try to band a book just to start drama. They know it will cause a lot of crazy things with the author.     Finaly If they band books for being offense then they would not have a libary. Cause any body says something is offense.In all they should not band one book."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3637	2	"Should we have the right to be able to remove materials from shelves if they are found offensive? I believe that we should not have the right to be able to do this. I believe that if we had the right there would be no materials left for future children to read. A big thing to consider when you think about this right, is even though our materials speak of discrimination, or use a word that someone might find offensive, or even if we did not like the book, movie or magazine and thought that it was a waist of space. We should never have the right to be able to remove these materials.     I know of several people that think the harmless childs first book is trying to discriminate someone, or a race of people. There are books out there that are discriminating certain races of people, or informing us of a time when people were discriminated against. If we would have the right to remove these materials, all of them would eventualy be gone. Our future children wouldnt know that the event even happened or if they did half of their information would more than likely be wrong, since over years people would probably change the story to a version that they wanted their child to think.     If someone found one single word in the book or even a movie that they thought was offensive then they would have the right to remove the material from another persons view. If someone found a curse word in the material that they found offensive, or if they just find the idea of using curse words offensive they would be able have the material removed and that would mean that thousands of good books and movies would disappear for a word that one person did not like.     Some people might find them to be a waist of space and just remove it, if they did not like the book, movie, music or magazine. There are some people out there that like to read or listen to them and @MONTH1 find some of the them that we cant stand to look at, good or entertaining. Some people do not like a book by its size or by how big or small the words are. These arent ways to judge a book.     I think that nobody should have the right to remove a book, movie, music, or magazine from the shelf. We all should keep these materials as a reference to future generations. Past people in the world have destroyed materials that they didnt like, now we will never know what they were about or even trying to tell us. There is no reason to remove a material just for the oppinion of one person or even the oppinion a a group of people."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3638	2	"Removing certain materials from the shelves of libraries is not the way to go. No matter how offensive they might be, there are many other ways to solve this problem. I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from libraries for being too offensive.      First off, many people have different opinions about what is offensive and what is not. For example, many people have different intrests than others. Some people @MONTH1 like certain kinds of books and movies while others @MONTH1 not. For instance, one of my favorite types of movies to watch is a comedy. On the other hand, there are many friends of mine that love to watch horror movies. This is something you can not change. Everyone is going to have their own preference on what they want to read, listen to, or watch. Why would you take things away that people actually enjoy? There are other ways to solve this problem.      I believe that we can solve this problem by just seperating certain materials from others in the library. For example, if something is thought to be offensive, then it can be placed with others like it. These materials do not have to be removed completely. Mothers are often worried about their children picking up things in the library that they think are offensive. If these materials are seperated from others, there will not be a problem. Certain materials do not have to be removed completly from a library.      All in all, there is no need to remove materials from a library because many people have different interests. In conclusion, I believe that materials should not be removed from libraries for being to offensive"	4	3		4	4	4	4																		
3639	2	"I'm really sick and my head really hurts at this moment while having to write this paper, so please take @CAPS1 easy on me.      Any source of literature is someone's own creation of imaginiation, taken in whatever direction they so choose for @CAPS1 be to be taken. The creation of that art form as writing would be nothing less then lonesome trash floating the winding streets if @CAPS1 were censored.       @CAPS1 is almost like when watching television; your kids are up and want to stay up late to watch the new horror movie but no way, that movie is way to scary for them, plus @CAPS1 shows some nudity. If the movie is not appropriate for your children then do not let them watch @CAPS1. In a library though, your mother might not always be there to pre-read your books for you. So maybe you just have to assume responsibility and read the book if you choose to, or not read the book depending on how your mother would feel about @CAPS1 of course.      The thought of there being censorship in libraries is quite ridiculous. Of course I would not like to see @PERSON1: @CAPS1 in my childrens section but that is all up to just having books in their right sections. Have the explicit books on one side of the library and the non on the other side. The main point is that most people that make use of the library are old enough to choose a book of their liking and if they are not they have their mother accompanying them"	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
3647	2	"There are many books, music, movies, and magazines that people find offensive. Some people even believe these things should be taken off the shelves. I do not believe that the books, music, movies, or magazines should be taken off the shelves completely. Not everyone finds these things offensive and they should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them.     First, people have different views on what they find offensive. Not everyone will find the same things offensive or want the same books or song to be removed. With people always having different views it is difficult to take books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves for everyone. Just because one person does not agree with what is being said in the movie or book does not mean that every single person wants that movie or book to be removed. If one person found my favorite book offensive I would not want it taken off the shelves completely.      Equally important, if every book, song, movie, and magazine that someone finds offensive is taken off the shelve there would not be many books, movies, songs, or magazines left. Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove a book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is saying that if every single book that offends someone is taken off the shelves there would be no books for anyone to read. People find different things offensive and if everyone took these things off the shelves there would be none left for anyone.      Finally, if someone finds a book offensive they do not have to read it. When someone finds a book, movie, song, or magazine offensive they don't need to watch it or read it. Instead of taking it off the shelves the person could just not read it. Not everyone finds the same books offensive and taking them off the shelves could upset many people. When someone finds something offensive they could just avoid that instead of getting it removed and upsetting other people. If someone was offened by one of my favorite books, I would prefere if they just avoid reading it instead if taking it off the shelves so that I can not read it.      Some people find many books, songs, movies, and magazines offensive. They would like these things to be removed from the shelves permenatly. I, however, do not believe that these things should be removed. Taking these off the shelves could make some people happy, it could also upset even more. Not everyone finds the same things offensive and should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3650	2	"There I was, shuffling my way through the library, finding the perfect books to check out.  It was then that I had stumbled upon a book that looked incredibly interesting.  The cover page featured a depressed girl with the look of hope plastered on her face and the back included the summary of a book I wanted to get my hands on.  The book, titled @CAPS1, was about a girl who went through some troubled times but found her way out of it.  Stories, novels, magazines, or books on tape of any type find their way onto our library shelves, it is then our job to discover them.  Whether literature includes stories of love and breakbreak, sorrow and depression, or the success of a sports team, it should all be allowed on our library shelves.      Opinion, everyone has one that conflicts with someone elses.  Our world revolves around these different viewpoints and ideas, should our literature and music not reflect these opposing sides?  Literature is an escape for many people, it is their way of experiencing the world and to live through the main character of whatever they are reading.  If we remove books that @MONTH1 be offensive to one, we are taking away that opportunity for others. In my opinion, the removal of the potentially offensive material in our libraries, is sheltering our world.       Regardless of how hard we try, children and teenagers will one day be exposed to the offensive material we are attempting to remove from their lives.  We should not attempt to hide what our actual world is like, rather allow them to experience it in a safe way, like reading or listening to music.  If someone views material as offensive, it should be the parent's responsibility to regulate whether their child reads or listen to it or not.  The removal of the potentially offensive material would not be any help.     In conclusion, offensive material should not be removed from our libraries, rather regulated through our parents or elders.  The idea of regulating what is on our shelves is not the most effective.  If any material has the potential of being offensive, it is not the library's role to regulate whether or not it is displayed to the public"	4	5		4	4	4	4																		
3653	2	"Maybe, to a sense I do not think that boo'ks should be removed to an extent. The reason for this is becasue that some books, magazine and other stuff can be informative. They can help you wtih certain questions. They @MONTH1 not always answer what you need but they are there to look back at and see what type of generation we have.      But, there is also other reasons things that can be offense to others. People @MONTH1 take that aspect to the next level to where they are getting hurt. I think that maybe certain books and magazines should be removed. They tend to do damage to others and can hurt other poeple. The sense of this nautre is to ask the store to remove the books or magazine. The store can not take the books off the shelf if one person is offended by the book.      If you take every offensive book of the the shelf then you will not learn from the other mistakes it has taken on other peoples lives. They maybe think it would be a good idea to books off the shelf but younger adults could not learn the mature items that the parents do not want to terach. They @MONTH1 think they are doing t the right thinking by not showing you sexual offenive stuff. You @MONTH1 not want kids or others to see this sexuality and see what the world is becoming.      Also, I can see why they would want to take that stuff off the shelves. They @MONTH1 not like what they see but they think it is the truth and is very offensive to see the sexual, mental illness people have. Certain books @MONTH1 stay on the shelf such as a @CAPS1 book. @CAPS1 books so the human body they do not hid the human body we should know about the human body. So the @CAPS1 books and magazines should stay on the shelf. If you want to look at naked provakadive stuff then go to a sex store. Do not put out books in public that can show the sexually side of humanbeings.     The @CAPS1 magazines are there to learn not for enjoyment. You can go to a different store for enjoyment. But, if you take off stuff that can be offensive to others then that means you would have to take off the @CAPS1 items. People could get offenive by not looking like the poeple in the magazine. That could offend them so would you take it off the shelf or not. Not you would not becasue a @CAPS1 book is there for you learning envoirment not to ofen you. That also could go for the sexual magaizes. Yes, sex is good for you but would you want to teach that to ounger kids that fast. You would want to teach them about sexual introcourse not a magazine. I know that @CAPS1 books and tapes can be incouraging sex but they are mainly talking to adults.     As far as music and tapes go no I do not think that those types should be removed. That is for enjoyment and people liek to relax to this sorta stuff. I mean I do not buy tapes of @CAPS2's or music but othe people do. They enjoy it if you did take it off then what else would they put up? You have to think about the younger generations. The older generations lived a happy not violent life. But, for teenagers now in certain places they have it hard. They need to make a living on the street. They need something to listen to. This offensive music is to listen sure some music is horrible but what music isnt these days.        If music is what you are instersed in then why would we take it off the shelves. People make a living listeing to music and cerating it for others. It is a wonderful thing it really is what makes the world go around. Making stores and stands take the music and newspapers off would be a disappointment to see such a wonderful thing go down the hole because it hurt others.      If you go back to the @NUM1's there music was about drugs as well and nobody ever had a problem about that. Maybe people don't have a problem with it but its becaseu they grew up around it. Just like we have grown up to the rap and the sexual musice. We are teenagers and you were once a teenager. You know you would not be listeing to a beetles song that wouod not be about drugs or sex or getting high. The beetles sang about all the stuff singers sing about now.      Generations change and so does the enivorment but  you can not change they way we grew up. You can try to make it better but it will take a lot of will power. The generations now are tough and they wont let down. You might as well stop trying to take down what we grew up to away from us. Nobody was trying to take away your music so why would you take away ours.     Its not something you want to take away it's somthing you want to look back and see how much are generations have changed from one to another"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3657	2	"I believe the current way materials are censored and removed works, and should continue. While everyone @MONTH1 dislike a particular novel or book, libraries can not remove every book a person dislikes, as Katherine Paterson said. When a book appears so controversial to the point where the majority of people disapprove of it, then the book usually is taken off of the shelves.     The possibility children will see the offensve material appears unlikely. Most public libraries do not put their offensive material near the childrens books. At my local library, their is a section that has the more offensive or obscene books all in one place. To acquire these books you must have a parents permission or be @NUM1 years of age. It is very unlikely a child would ever see the materials in question.     Numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated. @PERSON3 @PERSON2 @MONTH1 have had racial slurs in it, but if one considers the time and place of the novel, these slurs were normal for the time. Someone can not be frustrated with a novel written @NUM2 years ago because it has something offensive in it by todays standards.     While I believe, for the most part, libraries should not censor or remove materials, there should be some restrictions set in place to keep extremely harmful materials out of libraries. For instance, libraries should not have dirty magazines or movies on their shelves. If a high majority of people want a particular material banned, then it is hard to ignore them. When a book is so vulgar people begin to protest the book, there are questions as to whether the book should remain on library shelves. When a high percentage of people join that cause, then it should be banned.     Censoring or removing materials from libraries remains a hot topic today. I believe the current system in place to censor or remove books does its job, and that it should continue. If few people disapprove of a particular material, the book remains in most shelves uncensored. When a lot of people begin to protest that same material, it has a high probability of being banned. With this process, every book with a racial slur or questionable scene is not removed, while the ones that truly deserve it are removed."	4	5		4	4	4	4																		
3676	2	"The library is meant to be a place that is filled with materials of all different genres and types. Many of us go to the library because we are looking for something in particular, rather than just browsing. Although some materials that people need to research at the library @MONTH1 be considered inapproproate for certain audiences, it still serves as a useful resource for others. This @MONTH1 include getting information for a research paper, renting a movie that needs to be watched for school, or looking for a certain type of book to read. By taking certain books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves, we are limiting the amount of materials for people to borrow.     At many schools, students are asked to write research papers. What is considered a valid subject for a high school research paper @MONTH1 include information that is not suitable for all groups of people. A student @MONTH1 write a research paper on the effects a certain drug has on an individual. Just because the student chooses this topic, does not mean that he or she supports it. Some adults @MONTH1 say that information on drugs should not be on the shelves in a library because it @MONTH1 include material that they consider graphic, but a student looks at this material only as a resource for an educational purpose.     My freshman year we read @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. We also watched the movie to get a better understanding of the differences between our time periods. There is death and violence in the movie, along with a brief flash of nudity. Many would consider even this great literary work as a movie inappropriate. The movie helped us to get a real life picture of how things were back then. We were mature enough to look past the graphic scences and see the movie for what it really was. If this move was taken off the shelf, some people wouldn't have fully understood the story because they couldn't picture it.     Sometimes, we just want a good book to read. Many teens gravitate to the young adult section because it includes age-related material. Many books in this section @MONTH1 include works that have a dark or graphic theme with subjects that are inappropriate for younger children. If we eliminated books from this section because they are being censored, we will end up with even less teens that read. Certain books provide an escape for some teens, and @MONTH1 even help them to confront or deal with problems in their own lives.     If libraries start censoring books we @MONTH1 end up with less and less readers as the years go on. Instead of censoring the books, we should censor the people reading the books. If a parent doesn't want a younger child to read about a certain topic, then they should keep them away from that material. Libraries can put age approval marks on certain books to permit only certain age groups to read them. Authors of the books should not be punished for what they choose to write about by taking their books out of the library. No matter what a person's purpose for reading is, they should have a choice of what kind of material the book contains."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3680	2	"I will be talking about, do think books, music, or even magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive. In my opinion I don't think books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive too some people. Because not all people have the same interests.     First of all I think things shouldn't be removed from library shelves because people don't like the items because they get offended. But the people who like the item say like an explicit @CAPS1 they would probably buy it. But also the people who don't the explicit @CAPS2 would get offended and would want it off the shelves.     Another example can be a book. what if a person didn't like what he/she read and gets offended. They would return the book and would not want to sell anymore and wouldn't mention it to a friend. But another person comes along and picks the same book and did like what he/she did read and that person would probably recommend it to a friend.     The same way goes for a magazine also. What if a person gets offended at an advertizement. A person likes it and returns it, then comes along another person who gets offended at it and doesn't like it it shouldn't stop selling for that particcular person.     In conclusion I think things in the library shouldn't stop selling because one person gets offended at it. they shouldn've look at the item in first place."	3	3		3	3	4	3																		
3683	2	"Should there be censorship in libraries? People think that there should be and some think it shouldn't matter. I think there shouldn't be because maybe some people like those books. I have three reasons why there shouldn't be censorship. My reasons are first people like certain books and should be able to get what ever they want. Second, the libraries should be able to put what ever they want on the shelfs. Third, if you don't like what the books say then don't get the book.      Libraries have many books for you to choose from and you can pick which book you want to check out. Libraries don't need to censor their books because some people might want books like that. Everybody has there own preference on the kinds of books and music that they like. Censorship wouldn't allow them to get what they want which would make them mad. There is all kinds of genres of books and music around, some have more strong language in them then other genres. Some people like their music uncensored and should be able to get it. Libraries and entertainment stores are the ones who buy the books and music not you.     Libraries have the freedom to get what ever books they want to and put them on shelves. If you don't like what certain books or music say then go get something you do like. There is no rule that says you have to get a certain kind of music. Some people like the music genre called rap which does have some strong language in it but its your choice to listen to it. the stores just put the products on the shelf to make money not to get you angry about what the products say. There are sections on the shelves that say what genre they are.     People that want to say something about what the language is like in the book should not have checked it out. You have the right to ask what certain music, books, or movies are like, and movies have ratings on the case. Music and movies have ratings which tell you how strong the language is on the cases. People can not say to monitor that when it tells you everything thats in the movie or @CAPS1. The libraires and stores usually mark the sections on what genre they are. That can tell you where the uncensored parts are. You can stay away from those sections if you find them offensive.      The libraries should not have to censor there books and entertainment store should not need to censor all the music and movies. Its your choice what to get not theirs. People can stay away from those areas that they find offensive. Everybody should be able to get what they want even if it might offend others."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3703	2	"I do not think that libraries or any one should have censorship to books, movies, music, magazines ect. People who put there time to writing all of there thought and ideas in that should not be just thrown off the shelf. People who wrote that stuff have freedom of seach and the wright to write that stuff or say that stuff.      Yes I have read books that I have found offensive or that I don't like, but I dont think they should not be in libraries. They are there because some other people @MONTH1 like that kind of stuff no reason why we should exclude what they like to read out of the libraries that everyone shares and goes to. There would be nothing left in libraries because almost everything out there someone could find offensive.     For example people such as @ORGANIZATION1. People say his lyrics and music say alot of bad stuff but most of his music is about him and his life. He has the freedom of speach to wright and publish that for the world to see and hear. His music is just i @CAPS1 of his life. In history @CAPS2 because he killed people. Should take him off the shelf because jews @MONTH1 think it was offensive, yeah it might be but it lets people know about our history and what has happened. If we keep that cencored who know history my repeat its self. which is a saying I have heard many of times.          So censorship or not I just think they had the freedom of speach to write that stuff down and be put in a library for people to see learn, edgucate, and entertain themselves by. Doesn't mean if it offeneds you that its offensive to other people"	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
3707	2	"Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 are many books, music, and magazines that are saturated with offensive words or obscene themes.  However, just because a book or song contains an foul word does not mean that the book needs to be sheltered from the public's eyes.  @CAPS2 are many reasons we should not censor public media.  We cannot ignore wrongdoings happening in our world; plus, in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech; and, finally, if media was censored, people @MONTH1 start to think every little word has an offensive connotation.     If a bystander observes a person being abused in a hallway or alley, the bystander just cannot pretend like the incident never happened.  If the world never reported accidents, @CAPS2 would be too much crime and terror.  Sometimes, a book or movie is like a cry for help or a way to raise awareness about some wrongdoing in the world today.  Most of the time, I only hear about an event through movies or books, and I want to know the honest story, not a fairytale version of it.  After all, if the language in some slavery books was not as vivid as it is, some people @MONTH1 not oppose slavery as strongly as they do.    Here in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech.  We are allowed to give our opinions on any topic, and describe it in any way.  We should be permitted to say anything we want, even though in our hearts, we should know what is right and wrong.  People should at least be trusted enough to use their own conscience.     Also, another reason why books and other media should not be censored is because people @MONTH1 judge almost every little word offensive then.  Then we @MONTH1 have 'no books left on the shelf' according to Katherine Paterson.  Once people are allowed to censure books or other media, they would look for words with negative connotations.  If a word was close to being offensive in one person's perspective, it would be left out.  Then, many words would be gone.     Sure some types of media, especially songs and movies, just spill out nasty themes and foul language.  However, I have the choice to watch a movie or listen to a song.  I can always change the radio station if I do not like what I am hearing.  People however, just cannot remove the words of another right from their mouth, no matter how bad it is.  We just cannot pretend that we all live in a perfect world where everyone is polite and caring.  If we hear about something wrong in our world today, we need to act.  However, we might not act if we do not know the full extent of its terror.                                                            Sincerely,                                                              @PERSON2"	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
3720	2	"Books That Are Offensive     @CAPS1 view point is that books should not be taken off the shelfs if taken offensive to one person. Sometimes people get help from books that are offensive to others because somebody is doing something wrong and the book @MONTH1 help the other person. Everybody should be able to read a book if they want in a library. In a library everybody should have the right to read every book.     The idea of taking a book off the shelf is a bad because people want to read books like that. Some people have a problem with that type of book but if they don't like it then tell people not to read it not take it off the shelf. If anything put it in a different area or just move it put all that type of book in one area not mixed in.     When people need help they read a book or look it up. So if the book is offensive but can help somebody with problems then don't even move it. People do have a reason to read books that are offensive. We don't know all of the reasons but there are alot of them.     If a movie is not good for children or just very horid it @MONTH1 need to be put in a place where nobody will look. Kids and grown ups are the same and nobody needs to see a movie if it is really bad.       Usually when somebody takes something offensive they are guilty of something and know they are but will not admit it. People think other people write things that are just offensive on purpose ,but they don't they write it and somebody is guilty if something and can not live up to it. Sometimes just the reading is read wrong and misunderstood.     Everybody has had a book that they thought was offensive but then the next person read it and they might think it is funny. The biggest problem is some people can't read. then some people read so fast they do not comprehend it correctly.     I don't feel like them certain materials should be taken off the shelf if found offensive because that person @MONTH1 be feeling guilty of something. If the materials should be moved they should just be moved to a different area not off of the shelves totally. If it is taken offensive they should tell the librarian and then if very many more people say it is offensive then it can be taken off the shelf."	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
3723	2	"Newspaper staff and/or whom it @MONTH1 concern,      Reading material found in a library is very useful and informative to the world, there is no limit to what could be found on paper. Whether it be offensive or not, having limits to books will only create tension, effect the economy, and will lead to illegal activity, ironically enough, in which offensive books will be written and sold, completely undercover.      In today's world, it would be nearly impossible to pick up a book and factually state that it is not offensive. Almost everyone has some little issue with something in the world today, and because of that, original and unoffensive material are hard to come by. With the stripping of offensive material from libraries, authors will be devastated, not just emotionally, but will be out of a job and will have less income. Because of how virtually impossible it is to write a book that is not offensive, authors will become very frustrated, and most are very passionate about what they do. Also, because almost all reading material is offensive in some way, there will be little to no reading material on the selves of the world or nation's libraries. @CAPS1 could potentially lead to violent protests that quickly tear down even the most successful of nations. However, physical devastation would not be the only toll paid for the stripping of offensive reading material from libraries      Books cost money; to make books costs money, to buy books costs money. Paper companies would take a major nose-dive in the market, having almost no clientel. When a major divistion such as the paper industry falls, it will bring others down as @CAPS2, and due to the nation's market complexity, almost all major companies rely on paper. @CAPS1 would ruin the economy. Some might say, '@CAPS1 means that the people of @LOCATION1 will be much more green!' @CAPS2, the past few centuries when economics and the environment are put on a scale, economics takes the cake by a mile. Obviously, @CAPS1 will do much more harm than good. The people of the world always have a priority. Also, the majority of the people don't enjoy having something taken that they have grown so fond to.      People, in general, want what they can't have. An obvious example would be illegal drugs; the drug market is extremely successful, but it's illegal. If people were to have these currently illegal drugs for their use, being completely legal, chances are that the success of drug marketing will plummet. The opposite situation for books: We have them now, but when they are taken, we will want them even more. People who read tend to be very passionate about literature and very intellegent. All it takes is one group to gain numbers, and have a very talented speaker persuede others to follow in a potentially violent revolt to be given back permission to write and publish alleged 'offensive' books. All other material found in libraries, such as music and movies, being taken away will have the same effects, give or take a few similarities or differences.      Avoiding such problems is easy, keep the books and all other material in a library on the shelves. It will only be problematic to take it all away, especially for being offensive, when there are very few books that the general population will find not offensive. If keeping the material in libraries means individuals will become offended for very different reasons, let it be organized chaos. @CAPS1 is how people work, and keeping the material on the selves is how the people are pleased or motivated"	5	5		5	4	3	4

But in the case of libraries, all the books would have to be taken off the shelves. And if all the books are taken off the shelves, then all the books in stores would have to be thrown out as well.     Books are essential part of life. They have great ideas and thoughts expressed through these amazing pieces of word art. People who think that the books in libraries should be censored, are fools. These people want to keep their children and themselves safe, and that is understandable, but at the same time they are hurting people with the decision they have decided to put forth. Authors are hurt because it is their work that is being censored. People who enjoy reading the books, that are wanted censored, would no longer be able to read those books.     It is mainly the choice of the person to avoid these books if they truely find it offensive to themselves. They should not go all out of their way and try to censor them, because they would eventually might cause everyone or some people to think that they could find a book that should be censored. And if that happens, then there would be no more books on the shelves. The government will take notice and ban these books or worse remove all books forever just like what happened in @CAPS1 @NUM1.     Over all, books are a good thing. They gives us inspiration, and help us pull through life with the thoughts expressed in them. It is your choice to avoid the books that upset you, not what other people think about them."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3739	2	"Libraries in @LOCATION1     I am going to write a persuasive essay about what I think about some books and magazines that some people find offensive thing in the book. I dont think that just because it is offensive someone it should be taken off the shelf, because some people have different views over the book or magazine. So I am going to tell what I think over this subject.          I think if someone dose'nt like whats in the book they should just not read it or something, because some people might find it interesting. People just need to stop being so selfish and start thinking about others. For example the author of the book or magazine some how relates to them, and they probably made it so other people could relate to them also. Thats why I think people should not argue about taking books off the shelf and start thinking of others. Thats what I think about people trying to take the books off the shelf.     So whoever is reading this please take this in consideriation and relize that some people like different books than others. So don't start taking books off the shelf just because a few people find them offensive. So thats all I have to say about people that are trying to get them taken off the shelf because there offensive to them"	2	3		2	3	3	3																		
3741	2	Censorship in Libraries     I think that censorship in a library is fine some people @MONTH1 feel that children don't need to see certain things. Which that @MONTH1 be true there are a lot of things that even adult shouldn't even see themselves. If there is going to be bad things in the library the owners might make a section just for those things.      People should have the right to be able to look at anything that they want in the library	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
3742	2	"Libraries are a place where anyone can find books to read, on any topic they choose.  This is a right that should stay in the reader's hands, and not the library's.  Every person can read about whatever topics they please, and those working at libraries should not have an influence on which books peole read.     Censorship of books is competely unneccessary.  If somebody wants to read about a specific topic, then they have the right to.  Reading a book that is offensive to the reader is the reader's choice; nobody forced them to read it.  Upon finding a book that is offensive, the reader then can make that decision, and not read the book.  Though just because this one reader finds this book offensive, does not mean a different person would, and this different person has the right to read this book if they choose.     Finding a book offensive is a simply an opinion, and has no factual evidence.  So who has the right to say whether a book is offensive or not?  Just because somebody running a library belives a book to be offensive or innappropriate, does not mean the book should be taken off the shelf.  There is no one person who can say whether or not a book is offensive.     Other items such as music, movies, or magazines also should not be censored, though some of them are already.  Movies for example, are all rated, and this therfore gives the viewer the choice of what level of movie they would like to watch.  The viewer should not expect to check out a rated '@CAPS1' movie, and see no material with foul language, violence, or other 'offensive' subjects.  By choosing a higher rated movie, the viewer is making their own choice of what they see, and so the librarians should not take it upon themselves to take away these films.  It is simply not thier responsibility.     Music also is rated, and if thought neccessary, has a parental warning label, telling the listener that this album has explicit content.  Though just as with movies or books, everybody has the right to listen to whichever music they please, and should not have to search at places other than a library, because the librarian thought the music to be innappropriate.     Magazines @MONTH1 not be rated, but this does not mean the library should make the executive decision to rate them, and get rid of the ones found to be 'offensive'.  As mentioned several times above, it is the reader's choice to view material; not the librarian's.     Whether the material is books, music, movies, or magazines, the consumer has the right to read, listen to, or view whatever they please, without the influence of librarians.  Each person has their own say of what material they choose to consume, and nobody else has the right to tell them otherwise."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3750	2	"Should certain material found to be offensive be removed from the shelves of our library? Many people find material they see in libraries such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., to be offensive; but does that mean that they should be removed? I believe along with many others that libraries should not censor out offensive materials. To censor libraries would neglect parent responsibilities, destroy our profitable media, and be unconstitutional.      Parents are responsible for their children, not only when it comes to providing food and shelter, but also when their children are viewing inappropriate or offensive material. If you do not want your child to be offended or see vulgar shows, texts, and music, do not let them see it. For instance, if a child is listening to a sexual song on their I-pod take it from them. It is not a right to have the device it is a privelage and parents are aloud to take away privelages.     In addition to neglecting the parent's responsibilities, it would be a gigantic blow to the media economically. Most media is viewed, because of the inappropriate material appearing in their shows, books, and music. If you censor all of that material out less movie tickets will be bought, less books will be sold, and less music will be listened to. In a time of recession, like the one we are currently coming out of it is more beneficial to provide as much income as possible, instead of destroying current oppurtunities for profit.      Both of these points are valid, but most importantly censoring libraries would be unconstitutional. In the preamble we are given rights to the freedom of speech and press. These offensive materials are included in this right. I understand admentments can be added to specify what type of speech and press is appropriate, but how will officers monitor that. Not to mention all the jail space that would be needed for people smuggling inappropriate material to buyers.      In brief censoring libraries is a bad idea in the areas of parent responsibilities, media economics, and our constitutional rights. When negatively effecting all of these areas the consequences are much more influential then the benefits. Obviously censoring is not the answer to offensive material"	4	5		4	4	4	4																		
3752	2	"No, I do not believe that anything should be taken out of a library because someone thinks it's offensive. I believe that poeple have the right to read what they want and so do authers have the right to wright what they want. One of the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 statements is @CAPS5 of speech giving people the right to say and wright what they want.     People shouldn't take anything out of libraries because libraries are built for storing things like books, magazines, music, and movies. If people start to take those things away then what use would be for a library. If everything is taken out then nobody would have any reason for going to a library.     This brings up the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. ''@CAPS5 of speech'' meens that people have the right to wright what they want to. if others find it offensive, then don't reed it. Also @CAPS5 of expresion lets people do this to. If people wish to express themselves by reeding it then they have that right.     One of my personal experiences is that I love music, so do my two best friends. One of them goes to the library to find music and we both listen to it. He found these bands I had never heard and I realy liked them. If someone found them ''offensive'' I would have never got to hear how good they were.      This is why I believe that people shouldn't take things out of the libraries. not only does it deny others of something they could love but it also destroys history. libraries will be around for a long time and they store so much information,it would be a shame to deny future people the right to read these wonderfull peices of work someone worked real hard on to create."	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
3757	2	"I belive that beople have the right to know and learn about stuff even if it is found offensive, the reasone why i say this is because if one person finds it offensive doesn't mean that another person might think it is. If people think that a film from back in the late @NUM1's about the @ORGANIZATION1 that is used for educational perposes is racist, then they need to just grow up and to go back to school for this stuff. Just because some people think that a book with vulger language is offencive then they need to know that more than half of the worlds book have profanitey in them and just because it does, doesn't mean that they need to be removed form the shelfs in the library.     I have had my own incounters with books that i thought were offencive, there was a book that i was reading in my fresh year of high school and there were people in it that were part of the @PERSON2 and they were having meetings and one guy said that he hated negros and they he had picked one for tonigh and were going to lynch them with the nuse they had made the night before and that really hurt me because I have some one in my famliy that is black and to think about someone doing that to him, that would just break my heart and I would probaly go out and find the people that did it and kill them.       In the quote that was writen by Katherine Paterson, she talked about how if she has the right to remove a book then we do to and if we do so then there will be no more books left for us on the shelf is a great way to say that almost everybook we have has something volger in them and if we were to take them all away then there would be none left. If there was the posibility of all the books being taken away from us then there would be a huge uprising and everything would be going down hill form there, because there are people that can't go a day with out reading a part of there book and some people have devoted three hours to reading ounce a day.     What im trying to say is that there is no way to get rid of our books today that have volger langage or something offencive in them because if we tryed to do that then we would be taking every book away in the world and then no one would be learning anything"	3	3		3	3	2	3																		
3769	2	"My views are that if it is offensive to someone or other people the certain maeterial shouldn't be taken off the shelf. I think you should have to have permission from a parent, or guardian if the material is explicit. For example in a store where you buy cd's, games ect... you have to be of age to buy the material that should be the same with books.          Say a book has a certain word on it like '@CAPS1' it shouldnt be taken off the shelf just because of its name. That brings up the subject don't judge a book by its cover. Just because the name isn't to someones standards it shouldn't matter. Pick the book up read the back and see what it's actualy about. Then if it's what you was exspecting it to be talk to someone who is in charge, and explain top them what the problem is in your case.     Also you could always have a section of the store, or librarie just for adults only. It @MONTH1 sound stupid, but it can actualy help out alot. There is tons of books out there that have things in them not appropriate for children. Such as love books, they talk about love, and passion in ways that are very innappropriate for children.      If there was a section of a store or librarie it could help keep these things out of your children, or other childrens minds. You or anyone else wouldnt have to worry about children picking certain material up that you wouldn't want them to see. Just keep this in mind next time your in a librarie and you see something you wouldn't like for your children to see"	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
3780	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3, I am a student from @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, I do think that certain materials such as books. music, movies, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because, some students read book on a daily basics and reading also keep some students out of trouble. The @CAPS8 I say that is because if you find a book you might be interesting in the book and you might share @CAPS2 with you youger sisters or brothers to keep them from doing the wrong things. Also some books that are offensive shows students to not do the things they see in the book. Some books that are offensive show how people that do bad thing have to pay the cost and people can learn from other people mistakes. Some books that are offensive show people what to do or what not to do so you wouldn' t have to pay that cost from doing something wrong.     Also music can be offensive because of the curseing that some of the songs have in @CAPS2.The music is sometimes good to listen to because songs speak and takes action in a certain way.The offensive part about the music is that some music is calm music and @CAPS2 keeps you motivated inside and some music have bad vibes to @CAPS2 and can make you do bad things.Most of the time music can make you happy and you can undertsand alot in life just by listening to music. Music is a description of life meaning that life is ful of offensive things but you have to be very selfcentered to understand.     Some movies can also be offensive because of the actions in the movies. Movies are enjoyable and you can also relate to some movies in your own way. At times movies can be very interesting because of the actions and drama in the movies. The titles in the movie can also be offensive but that don't mean the movie is a bad relation in the story.     Magazines can also be offensive because of the things inside of the magazine. Some magazines shows appropriate things that children and adults can relate to. Also there are different things like activitys and things for family and freinds to enjoy. Many magazines are different in there own way @CAPS2 depends on how the cover is and the person who created the magzine. Some things are good about magazines because they show you posters of some of the super stars in the music career.     There are alot of things that can be offensive in the world but you have to learn how to seperate yourself from the negative things in life. Also all things are not offensive because you can relate to some of the books and music that we here in these days. The most important thing is that you don't have to listen what the magazines and movies are telling you because, you have a mind of your own. People don't listen to what the books and etc, are going by because some of the things they are talking about is false information. So thats why i say @CAPS7 i do believe that cartain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.

3782	2	"People all around the world think differently about music, books, and movies. Some think that books and music should have different kinds of ratings. Some people think that a song should be rated '@CAPS1' for mature when others could think that it shouldn't have any rating at all. Level rating stops young kids from buying something they are not mature enough for. Level ratings help the parents know what the kids are getting into.      If everyone could pull off a book or magazine, etc then there would be no books left. This is why we have levels of maturty on the material. Levels are letters, such as '@CAPS1' for mature. '@CAPS1' means that their will probably be some naked and sexual play into the video or song. With this on their it warns the parent so that if they do not want their child listening to it they can take it away. This leaves the parent with some control over what kids can watch and hear.     Stores won't let kids under the age of @NUM1 buy a rated @CAPS4 movie. Rated @CAPS4 stands for sexual act, language, and blood. It can stand for more things such as drugs. I am happy that my nine year old can't buy a rated @CAPS4 movie, but senice the law says a @NUM1 year old kid should be aloud to watch it, then its saying they should be mature enough to see or hear it.     We should be happy that we can have some control over what are children watch and listen too. We could try getting rid of all bad books, movies etc, but over time I'@CAPS1 sure more will be made. I am also sure that over time we will find a old copy of a book on a website. We cannot save our kids their whole life, so over time we have got to let them grow up. Our kids will decide if they are mature enough to watch something we would rather them not watch. We just have to raise them the best we can."	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
3786	2	"'Book or no Book?' Certain studies have shown that there are many people in this world that have many diffrent intrest. Wheather that be cars, boats, toys, or animals it shouldn't matter what the intrest is. I firmly beleive that a library should have books over tons of things. Just because one person might not agree with it doesn't mean that another should not be able to read or possible learn about it.      This is a on going debate nation wide and there is going to have to be a decision made fast!! There are to many people making enimies all over the world. I was asked to submit my opinion and i beleive that they should be allowed to check out any book that they want too. If the opposite person does not agree with the fact that those books are being checked outh then they don't have to watch it.      There are multiple solutions to the problem. The librarys could have diffrent sections for diffrent types of books or such as sorting them by class or hobbies. There could also be age limits so that kids don't get ahold of anyting that they shouldn't be watching or reading.That way the other people would never even have to see the books that he or she does not agree with.      Well i cant wait to see how the results turn out!! I also hope they people make the right vote. Im not saying that my vote is the only way, its just my opinion.

3793	2	"A colossal number of significant and life-changing books can be found in the millions of libraries throughout the world. The big question is whether or not individuals should get rid of the books of lesser importance, and the books that are found offensive to a number of people. In my opinion, there are a certain number of books wasting away on the shelves of the library that need to be disposed of. That is why libraries need to discover which books are creating issues, such as books on race or religion. Although Katherine Paterson boldly argues against taking books off of the shelves, I strongly disagree and believe that libraries should remove materials that are creating tension or books wasting away on the shelves.     Race is an extremely important topic in the world today, and I believe books that discrimate against certain ethnicity's need to be removed immediately from libraries. @CAPS2, there are exceptions to this proposal. For instance, books talking about the civil war and underground railroad need to be kept in libraries because they are significant historical events. Unlike fantastic books about our nation's history, there are also books about race that are of lesser importance, and they @MONTH1 offend people. In that case, libraries need to crack down on this issue and remove offensive books from the shelves!     Secondly, libraries need to be extremely cautious about what music is made available to the public. It is important that we teach our children the difference between right and wrong at a young age, and if the kids hear some of the derogatory music on the shelves, they will lose all sense of what is right and wrong. As Katherine Paterson mentions in her quote,' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1, that same quote can easily apply to the music on display in the libraries.  By libraries exposing children to derogatory music, they are creating enormous liabilities for the children and their families. Overall, our society would benefit greatly if libraries removed derogatory and offensive music.     Lastly, Katherine Paterson says that if we keep removing offensive books from the shelves, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2, that is a nieve comment as @CAPS1 as an exaggeration. There are millions of libraries throughout the world and thousands of items in each of those libraries. Therefore, it would benefit our society if we would dispose of the items creating the greatest amount of tension, and there is one simple but effective way of doing that. When people are at the check out desk at the library, the library could have a sheet of paper asking if the customer found a certain book offensive. If the same item appears regularly on the list, remove the item. That would benefit everybody greatly because the offensive items would no longer be on the shelves, and it takes little effort from all parties involved.     In conclusion, I oppose Katherine Paterson's decision and believe libraries should remove offensive materials immediately. One highly controversial topic is race, and if the book is not informing us about a historical event, it should be removed. Certain derogatory and offensive music is available in libraries, and it should be removed from the shelves as @CAPS1. A quick and efficient way of figuring out which books are offensive is to have a list available to the public where they can write down which book they find offensive. Ultimately, libraries need to take action and dispose of the offensive materials that pose a threat to our society"	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
3794	2	"Do I believe that certain materials should be taken off book sheleves if found offensive? There are many answers to this question and many people have different views to the question. For instance, you have to look at all of the different races, customs, and more of what people believe in to find the true answer. Some materials are very offensive, but should they be taken off the shelves of our very own libraries?     There are thousands of books in a library, and hundreds are written every single year. These books range from romance, action packed, and scary. Now many books are starting to be found offensive to our society today. I have read many books and have not found hardly any book to ever be offensive. There are offensive things in other matierals such as: music, movies, and magazines.      I do recall listening to music, watching movies and reading magazines and not liking what i was doing at all. Some music today is just extremely bad. From the fowl language and missinterpretation of words, music has become worse. Some movies that I have watched are not very well either. Movies can be offensive in many other ways than any other material there is. You got the scary, gorry and the movies with all of the different sex scenes that are made every year. This can teach the younger kids what is wrong and right, as well let them be aware of what life is about.     I do believe that all of these materials should stay on the shelves of our libraries. Learning from books, music, movies, and magazines is good in a way. Knowing that many things in this world today are offensive to people, I think that it can only make our society stronger to help us understand all of the different views that our people have. Yes it can go in bad directions, but there are many ways to get people to understand what is right and what is wrong to push them to stride for the best.      Knowing that materials on our shelves are offensive, I still believe that the right thing to do is to keep them there. Clearly people get mad and upset when reading, listening, or watching these materials, but this is what makes us who we are. There will always be offensive stuff being said written and so on, but the way you can handle it yourself will show everyone around you that it is possible to change their own views of the offensive matter and look at it the better way."	3	4		3	4	3	4																		
3797	2	"Censorship has become a major part of the media now-a-days. It is everywhere: books, movies, songs, and television shows. The government is trying to make the children of @DATE1 less corrupt, but they will end up learning everything that is censored for their friends and peers anyways. I feel censorship is a waste of time for the government. Children learn mature information sooner than they should in @DATE1's society.     Censorship should be more for the media children and young teens pay attention to. It should not be put into more mature movies and music, such as movies with adult content and rap. Those are more of items for grown up and teenagers than for children. If parents allow their children to listen to and watch that certain media, then they must feel their children are mature enough and know enough to not be majorly effected by it. Censorship also ruins the quality of books, music, and movies.     Certain words help to better express people and their views. If they can not use the specific word they feel describes them the best, it tends to ruin the quality of their character. People cannot be themselves when they have to watch what they say and are looked down upon because of their choice of language. I, myself, am very free with my language and the inappropriate and vulgar things I say. They are just a part of my nature and help me to be more expressive of myself. There are probably better, more appropriate words to use when I am in public, but then I would not feel like I am being quite myself. I think censorship is corrupting our society.     The government is trying to control us with censorship. I am not one of those paranoid people that thinks the government is out to get them. This just happens to be one of my opinions of censorship. We should get rid of it. It is changing the way people are and the way they feel they can act around others. People have to be careful of what they say, and I feel that makes speaking and attempting to express yourself so much more challenging. Censorship should be stopped before it ruins the quality of all the media."	3	3		3	4	4	4

3802	2	"How would you feel if you were forced to only enjoy the exact things that everyone else enjoys? If you were limited to only certain subjects because all of the other choices were thrown out you might begin to feel trapped. Everyone in this world is different from the next person. So I believe that each person should be able to read any book they would like without any restrictions. Some reasons for my opinion are personal values, unique interests, and the fact that people should have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others.     For my first reason goes along with personal values. For example a person of higher authority @MONTH1 find a particular book, magazine, or movie inappropriate due to their values and beliefs. So if this person is the owner of the library they would be able to throw out all books and movies pertaining to that topic. This would make it unfair for the people who do enjoy these topics.      My next reason is that every single person has their own unique interests. If someone begins to dispose of books that they are not interested in the library will lose all of the visitors that do find that topic enjoyable. This can cause the library problems and be a disappointment to those who find reading about that certain topic a great way to pass time. Everyone likes different things and has different views. They should not be forced to read only the things that are selected by another person.     People should also have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others. I know from experience that being ostracized for doing what you enjoy is completely unfair. If everyone did the things that every other person does our world would not accomplish anything out of the ordinary. Many people find inspiration from books and movies so if these were limited to only particular subjects people would begin to feel pressured to be the same. Every person should have a right to enjoy the things that make them happy without being hurt by the opinions and judgements of others.     Books should be something that each person should have a choice in. If there are endless choices of books and movies a person could learn about many different things and develope a more open mind. If everyone in this world opened their mind people would become more accepting of others. So I believe anything that is published should be there for the public to read. No one should be limited because of other people's values or interest. The right to read the books, magazines, and watch the movies you like should always be present."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3803	2	"Should we remove books and media because they are offensive? I do not believe so. In this essay I will describe to you why I think this way.      The word offensive is a contreversial word. Is it kissing that makes books and media offensive or is it curse words or fighting. Many people see many different things.      Many off the books today's youth read are 'offensive' to older generations. That is because today's standerds are different. Children are more free to do what they want and say what they want, making offensive a changed word.     If a book, song, or video is offensive then the parents should take that up with their children. Things that are offensive for some people are just fine for other people. Just because it is out there does not mean that we have to see it.      So in conclusion I do not think that books and media should be removed from the shelf for being offensive, because offensive is a changing word and it is different for every person."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3804	2	"In my personal opinion, I do believe that certain materials whether it be in books, music, magazines, or movies be romoved or edited more carefully. Most parents, including mine, expect their kids to behave with manners and not use foul language or make out with their boyfriend or girlfriend in inappropriate times, and yet we promote it and that's unacceptable.      In bookstores or even libraries, they have some books on the shelves that can be considered inappropriate. We encourage and even push kids to read, but we can't even say, pick any book you want. These books @MONTH1 have foul language, gang violence, or even sexual jestures that I wouldn't even consider giving to a niece or a baby cousin.      There are many types of music out in the real world. Everyone has their favorite music and they have their least favorite. In my opinion, you can't make everyone happy so your just going to have to ignore it. There are different cd's, cassate tapes, or even records, that you can buy. Yes, I think what some people put in their music is not appropriate but we can always change the station on the radio. You don't have to purchase that cd, and you can always ride with no music on.      Magazines can get pretty ugly sometimes. Whether it's @PERSON1 on the front page with no hair, or @LOCATION1's next top model. Quite frankly, I don't mind seeing that in magazines but strict parents @MONTH1 not want their kids being exposed to @NUM1 actions. Magazines could talk about anything such as someone on drugs, alcohol, or winning the lottory. You just have to choose what you and your kids look at wisely.      People can get pretty crazy on what they do and how they do it. Whether it be in writing, singing, or pictures, you know there is always someone going to do something inappropriate. This is reality and there is nothing that we can do about it. If you don't want to hear it, don't listen. If you dont want to see it, don't buy it. Its quite simple"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3805	2	"Censorship in libraries!Do you believe that certianmaterials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?NO!, I do not think they should be removed. I believe everyone is intitled to there own opinion, @CAPS1 if something is offensiv eto one person @CAPS2 @MONTH1 not be to another. No one thinks the same or has the same opinion about somethings thats why there is a variety of books, music, movies etc. If you take out the 'offensive' things, @CAPS2 @MONTH1 cause offense to another.People just need to stop being sefish and understand everyone is different and we all have different interests"	3	2		3	3	2	3																		
3818	2	"I do not believe that any material should be removed from library shelves.  I stand frmly with this because it is a choice to read material that is found offensive.  I would not expect a young child to seek out inappropiate materials because they are not interested in them.  Just as I would not expect an adult to go searching for a little kid book.  Basically there is a maturity barrier that seperates what each age level is interested in reading.     There is no point in removing any material from libraries because you would accomplish nothing.  People who would get offended mainly children are already exposed to violent videogames which glorify war and violence.  And you can not just go ahead and remove material that you think is offensive.     If you removed offensive material from libraries then I guess you would have to shut down the internet as well.  A child could much more easily go to a computer and find anything offensive they want to find with the click of a button.  Also at a library their are age level restrictions on cards that prevent a child from checking out offensive material.     Some people might enjoy material that is offensive.  If material is removed  alot of people would be upset that libraries do not carry what they wanted.  There would be alot of complaints, and problems.  And some people might stop going to the library because the content was limited..     The best thing to do is allow libraries to have whatever material they want to have.  Many people will be satasified, and most people will be happy"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3830	2	"Have you ever felt as though your reading choices are dwindeling? Censorship is taking away our freedom to experince to read or listen to what we want, who has the right to tell us what we can watch, read or even listen to?     As an avid reader of all kinds of literature i cant stand censorship. Kids today need to be able to read what they want, to open up their minds to new ideas and ways of life. The so called 'banned' books are some of the best anyone can read, as @CAPS1 we should be able to read what we want, wether it is offensive or not.     If you want to put certain restictions on a book such as a age limit i can understad that, but to completely take them off the shelves then we are losing our greatest right as an @CAPS2 citisen. To read and watch or listen other media is a great way to learn about things other than what is in our back yard.     Music and television i understand some censorship, i dont want my little brother or any younger youth hearing the '@CAPS3 bomb' or seeing anythin obsene, but these days its getting harder and harder to control what they watch or listen to seeing how it's so easy to obtain those sources of media.      Many kids today have access to the enternet which can be good and bad. If a parent does not want their kids watching or listening to anything obscene then they have the right to but certain blocks on their computer. Kisd these days mainly use two kinds of media which are the enternet and @CAPS4, but a kid who wants to read should have as many choices as possible weather it be fiction, classics such as 'The @CAPS5 snd The @CAPS6', or educational litterature.     So is our reading choices becoming scarese? Yes i believe so, na it all has to do with censorship. We cant read some of the classics because the're 'racist' or are 'pornagraphic', but you have to understand for the time they were written the weren't. so let everyone read what they want when they want."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3836	2	"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 many people believe that certain books should be banned from schools, just the opposite is true as students can learn valuable life lessons from these books, get a deeper understanding of the past, and comprehend the true meaning of an author's unique style.     Over the years many well-written books have been on a 'censored list', meaning that they are at a risk of being removed from the library.  'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1', '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2', and '@CAPS3 to @ORGANIZATION3' are all examples of books that have been marked down as being offensive.  These books are all written in a style of their own and can bring a different lesson to every reader.  While one reader @MONTH1 love the story and wear out the pages, another @MONTH1 get halfway through and never finish it.  However, the belief that there is freedom of choice in reading is correct.     'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON1 is a classic example of a censored book.  Throughout the book there is foul language used that is considered offensive to some.  However, at the period of time the book was written, these words were not considered to be wrong.  Books like this should be saved for older generations to read; however, we also have to realize that if a parent allows their children to read that book at a young age, there is nothing that can be done about it.  None-the-less, removing the book from the library is not the correct response.     Ever heard the saying 'learn from past mistakes'?  Books are a fantastic way to learn about the past in a fun and enjoyable way.  They are a tool of knowledge.  Removing a book from a library is like removing hundreds of pages of knowledge.  Every story has a unique style, which @MONTH1 appeal to some and not to others.  Many books give readers a deeper understanding of what the time period was like when the book was written.     '@ORGANIZATION2' has been a known censored book from the beginning due to its somewhat dark and gloomy aspects at certain points throughout the story.  How many kids do we see at school carrying around one of the '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2' books?  They often state that it is their favorite book of all time.  If the book were to be removed from the library, it would cause many students to never have the opportunity to read a fantastically written book, which has a unique style about it.     Throughout our twelve years of school, students are taught to think for themselves and make their own decisions.  How are we encouraging this if we are removing materials from their grasp?  If we cannot let students make such a simple decision as to whether or not to read a book, we are teaching poor life lessons."	4	4		4	4	4	4

There are many people who thribe off of the horrable thing people put out in to the world. They love to pain of others. Instead of taking the offensive work off the shelves, there should be a age limmit to what sertan age groupes should read. Yees there are young kids who are reading this kind of things, but that lyes with the parents.           If there was a age limmit of what people should be able to read then that would solve the problem.As well we could have the parents sign out the book saying it is okay for their child to read such a book.      if we  had all of this then there would not be any more problems. it would be a nice controled libaray. so in conclustion this is the way to go. this is the futur of tommorw"	3	3		3	2	2	2																		
3850	2	"There is alot of different thing that can offensive to all sorts of  people . so if we started taking thing off tv or out of book ,and magazines we would be always takeing stuff out. if it to graphic for kids put it in the adults area. would censorship be the awnser to take out  stuff no. we need to be more aware of where ur children are an there would be less probblem.     If we made the change the age limited on movie we might be even better off . If parent were to watch the movie then the parent would be able to tell them what ok an what not. we need to put more true history stuff in them an make them where you want to watch them we could be teaching kids more stuff so they know.the music should be censorship some what like with rap. there is alot of rap music that should be cleaned up so little kid dont hear it.      There might even be a better way to controll this stuff so little kids cant get a hold of it. We can have teacher help tell the kids an let them no that it not right for them to watch that. we also need to look at some of the new cartoons that are on tv. There are some that need to be clean up. There are also lot of different in what people want. Then there some that dont care about it to.

3852	2	"A library is a public place for all ages. They have many different kinds of books for specific reasons. For the children they have a nice comfy spot for them to pick a book and sit down and read it. For adults they have coffe tables, sofa seats, and many different things while they read their books. never should a library have to disclousre certain materials because of the ages that come in and out.              Censoring a library would not make it any easier to keep young children away from certain materials that are offensive. I feel that when a child is in a library they should go to their specific areas for which they came for, they should also be monitored while in the library. Most kids woldn't go to a book that doesn't have a lot of pictures or colors in it any way. The library is a public place and is made for all ages, even though there are book stores that sell just adult books, movies, and magazines, they still shouldn't throw them out of a library. There should be equal rights all over, yes even in libraries.     The world is full of offensive things period. Now while a child a is not within a library they could be at home or in a public place and see things that they could also see in a book at the library. The removal of certain books, movies, and magazines wouldn't really stop anything. I think that if the parents teach thier children right from wrong there is nothing wrong with them being in a library that has adult books, movies, and magazines. If I owned a library I personally would not mind all kinds of books that are appropriate to a certain exstint in my selction of books. I have been to plenty of libraries and have seen stuff that I thought shouldn't be in thier but at the same I was not in my right section or doing what I was supposed to be doing. This subject really doesn't bother me, so no I don't think they should remover certain books just because children are in the library."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3859	2	"I do not feel these types of things should not be taken off the shelves.What i think is that thing should come with a rateing because  this is a free country and for some one to do something like that it would be takeing away someone's freedom of speach.To many people have faught in the past for just simply freedom of speach.I think that if people rate the  thing's  that come out then they will not go in to the wrong hands. That's like saying they should have taken @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 when it first came out off the market because it has violance in it ,profange language,and guns that company will had lost a lot of money because it is inapprotive for kids.I think that parent's shouldn't go buy a @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old something like that but some parents do .It not the creaters fault of the actions of how people react to what ever is put out there because the buyers have to be more responseable and make sure that what ever it is is supervised and carefully montoired. There's an old saying ' every thing isn't made for every body' .I strongly belive that;That saying is so true .Every body don't like the same thing that some one eles likes but its okay for that person but it's not okay for you because as they say everything isn't for every body and you can't fource nothing on some one.Well every thing isn't approtive  for every one we all have are limites to every thing and if you watch what kids watch and do than things want be so inapprotive for this wold . Certion books young children should not read because they have sex in them and they talk about things that a child should not even be thinking about at that age.When children read books like that they tend to think about sex and how what they read about will feel but children should not be thinking about that type of stuff that why its there parent's responseabitly to montoir what there children read because that there job as parent's to do not the person who wrote the book because they @MONTH1 think there writing to a much older group that can relate to what there talking about but then again there just speacking there mind and infourceing there freedom of speach right one of the rights that we as a people together have been fighting for .I also feel that music help's us to express are selfs so if someone feels that the music is inapprotive for there child then they need to watch what there child is listen to.Music brings out the different moods in every body.All magazines are not for every one because as we all know there are adult magazines the produce certion imagary that children should not see but you can not blame the creater only the buyer is in fault for leaving it in the wrong place after there done with it .There just people trying to make money  off things that they know that people like."	3	2		3	3	2	3																		
3865	2	"Katherine Paterson, who is an author, thought that if a book was not one that she would want her children to read that it should be taken off the shelf at the library. If you found a book in your public library offensive, would you want that book removed from your sight and public view? Personally, I wouldn't. I would not want the book to be removed because that book could be a good learning experience for others. In this essay, I will explain from my personal experience @CAPS5 I disagree with Katherine Paterson.     In the sixth grade, I learned about how to find a certain book in a public library using a system. We had to find certain books in our school library, using this system, as an assignment. One of the books we had to find was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I found it very easily because I knew where it should have been and what it looks like. But there was a child in my class who had never seen a @CAPS2 in her life. After helping her find the @CAPS2, she ask, '@CAPS5 is this book so important to people? I don't understand it.' I explained to her in the best of my ability the life of @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 this was important to me. She soon found out that it was something she wanted to learn more about.     It is against the law in some states that a @CAPS2 be in school at all. This is because of others beliefs or non-beliefs. If it were not for the library having the @CAPS2 on a shelf that girl would never have learned something that is now important to her. A book can be offensive to other people but that book can change a person's life forever. Katherine Paterson believed that some books should not be found in libraries. Unfortunatley, other people think this also. One book can change a person's life, what if that book was not in the library to change another?"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3868	2	"Whose to say what is appropriate for whom? whose to judge right and wrong for anyone? It depends on a point of view like most things. The sheltered must learn one day, and if kids learn now about the truth, such as, not to stick forks in outlets, then they won't be as curious when they are older. Being sheltered is not always a good thing and censor ship of what we read, watch, or listen to is ridculous, and disrespectful to authors.          In matters of censorship, I find it to be pointless. Censorship doesn't prevent your kids from learning about anything, except mother won't let me watch that. it just keeps your kids more curious and more obligated to hide things from you and like they cannot ask you questions or be open and honest with you. Causes children to go behind your back more and when they're in trouble they'll as if your they're last place where they can ask for help, where you should be they're first resort.         No, I do not believe that libraries should censor anything. Its altering a authors work. How would it feel if you had written something and it had been published and was in the library and didn't like something about it so they decided to just bleep it out or not allow certain people to read it? I believe censorship should be illegal not required.          Sheltering things from kids prevents them from maturing, and discovering the real world. The idea that the world has no evil, or hiding the evil from your children will in most cases cause them to rebel and in other cases leave them unprepared for the future and the real world. Wouldn't you rather be able to help your kids and teach them about things instead of tell them that everything is perfect and only bad people use that kind of language. Or make them feel like a bad person for do something your grandparents did when they were young?      I conclude that censorship is injust, unfair, and is the real wrong. Not the profanity or the violence that will one day be apart of their life in some way. You don't go through everyday in the 'real world' with a mindset of there's nothing wrong in this world. Or everything is censored and everything is controlled  I believe censorship is just another way of controlling the mind through nuture"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3873	2	"Censorship in @ORGANIZATION1 has been around for as long as their has been the various mediums of art. In many cases the censorship @CAPS9 of what many would agree as not suitable material for anyone to create and enjoy. But then in other more serious issues that the censor has deemed not suitable for a certain audience, or even to a whole country. What @CAPS9 it that gives a select few the right to ban any given number of imaginative creations, even if they are in some aspects more lued in nature?     Censorship has and @CAPS9 still a very usefull tool that many governments employ to accomplish a wide variety of tasks, considered to ensure the 'safety' of both our minds and bodies. Some of the more widely know cases of this most despicable tactic of control come from the countries of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4R, @CAPS3 @LOCATION5, and @LOCATION2. In these countries all materials that are deemed potentially hazardous to the wellfare of the @ORGANIZATION2 are heavily policed and in many cases destroyed. The most noteworthy instances of this occured in @LOCATION3, where the @CAPS4 would gather up large amounts of books from the people and burn them in massive rallies. The people were so enthralled by the @CAPS5 leadership that they would often times freely relenquish their books with no resistance, and in some cases join in and throw the books in themselves. The same thing @CAPS9 still occuring in @LOCATION5 today, wtih a censor still on their internet surfing possibilities. In @DATE1 the popular search engine @ORGANIZATION3 attempted to set up shop in the country, but quickly entered into dispute with the @ORGANIZATION2 about the censoring of certain materials. Some months after the argument began over the censoring of @LOCATION5's people, the company completely removed all bans for a short time, much to the dismay of the @ORGANIZATION2. During that time it @CAPS9 reported that some of the main search topics were that of many social reformers and of different religions than that of the @ORGANIZATION2's sanctioned religion. But the one country that takes the cake for having the most censorship @CAPS9 @LOCATION2, they're @ORGANIZATION2 has restricted and policed any technology in the country. The common people live in a so called '@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8'.     In our home country of the @LOCATION1 we are promised many rights to protect our freedom as citizens. We are promised the freedom of speech as well as press, and in censoring our libraries they would restrict both. If we do not stand up and protect our rights, then who will? Are we not a @ORGANIZATION2 for the people, by the people? Why are we allowing the censorship of our own intellectual creations in a place that was created to provide access to said materials for those who are less fortunate, so they themselves can gain knowledge and understanding. If we as a people were to allow such a blatent restriction on our given freedoms, then we are in no position to have them in the first place. Our country was founded and later almost torn apart by the men and women who were willing to risk it all in order to protect their freedoms in this country. Are we descendants of those same people? If so why should we allow ourselves to squander what was hard fought for and earned by our forefathers.     The censor often poses a few questions that do cause one to wonder '@CAPS9 it really better off this way?'. They point out that for every great work of intellegent art, other of a more deviant nature create some more innapropriate pieces of 'art'. Pornography @CAPS9 the most prevalent of their examples, pointing out that if they did not restrict it, then who would stop the hundreds of children that not only roam the libraries bookshelves but also the provided internet services. It @CAPS9 a reasonable question, once that should be take into consideration, but in answer to it I believe that it @CAPS9 and will always be the job of the parent or guardian that bring the child with them. It @CAPS9 simply not enough to drop a child off at the local library and hope they find something interesting. Helping that child find what they want @CAPS9 a journey that should be taken by both the parent and the child. And what about those who believe the censor isn't always right about what @CAPS9 and what @CAPS9 not acceptable for the general @ORGANIZATION1? As author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     Censorship has been around for a very long time, and will most likely never be fully cut out of any functioning @ORGANIZATION2. That @CAPS9 sadly an inevibility that cannot be avoided. But the amount that it occurs in your daily life will be directly affected by how much of your freedom you are willing to stand up for."	5	6		5	4	4	4																		
3877	2	"Censorship has become a major topic when it comes to books, music, and movies.  These are being censored because people don't want young kids to read, listen, or watch these materials.  What about the adults?  Books, music, and movies being taken off of the shelfs in libraries because of censorship, is not fair to the adults.     Books now are being rewriten so they won't have offevsive language in them.  To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 is a classic example of this.  Changing the offensive language in this book would totally ruin it.  This book is mainly about the racism that whites had towards the african americans, and if that was altered the readers wouldn't get a sense of that racism.  If libraries have books that are censored they should put them on a shelf just for censored books so adults could still be able to read them.     Music is another peice of material that censorship has gotten a hold of.  Offensive language is being taken out  of songs and uncensored cd's are not being sold in some stores because of censorship.  Some adults like the original songs with the original words.  Libraries should carry both the explicit and the clean verions of cd's to they some them that are suitable for kids and the ones that adults can listen to.     Movies are another peice of material that censorship has taken over.  They are being rated @CAPS3, suitable for all ages, @NUM1, suitable for children @NUM2 and older, and rated @CAPS4, suitable for people @NUM3 and older.  These rating are good guidelines, but parents should be the ones to make the final decision on whether or not their child should be able to watch a certain movie.  Libraries should have all kind of movies on their shelfs.  If a twelve year old kid wants to watch a @NUM1 or rated @CAPS4 movie, he or she should be able to with the consint of a parent or guardian.     Censoship is a good thing but it doesn't need to be taken to the extreme.  If an adult wants to read a censored book, he or she should still be able to read it at their local libary and if a young kid wants to watch a rated @CAPS4 movie, he or she should be able to with the consint of a parent or guardian."	4	4		4	4	3	4

There are some books, magazines, movies, and ect., that we all run into that have very bad language, racism, bad religious talking, and even some about sex. Nobody needs to be reading those kind of books, it is bad for our minds and is very offensive to some people. A lot of people do not like to hear curse words or see them. Seeing those words in a book will make that person think wrong things about the library and put the wrong words in their head. Then there are those books about racism and that is the worst topic to most people. If someone came across that in a book, it would hurt their feelings and they would not want to finish that book.

There are a few ways that the library could handle the books that offend people. The librarian could think about putting a warning sign up and seperating those books, magazines, and etc., into their own section for people that do get offended by those things know where they are and know not to look there. Or inside the front cover the librarian could put a warning note on there to show the person that there are some things in there that @MONTH1 offend someone. It would be very helpful to so many people!      In every library you won't see that all the books are perfectly good. We all know that there are going to be some bad things in books, but there are some books that are way too inapropriate and those books can be removed. There are just way too many people that get offended while reading the books they want to read. Let's put a stop to it.     In conclusion, many of the libraries around are going to have the kind of books that offend some people. There can be a stop to that by removing them from the shelves or at least warning others about the things in the books, magazines, and all the other entertainment people like these days. It would be amazing to know that all the people that love to read will not be offended by what they are reading!"	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
3903	2	"Do you think @CAPS1 is going to prevent people from getting offended? Taking items such as a books, music, movies, magazines, ect., will not stop people from getting offended. The @CAPS2 question's are who decides what is offensive, and how is it offensive? What makes something offensive"	2	2		2	2	1	2																		
3904	2	"Many people in the @LOCATION1 read. Books, magazines, news papers, and music are a great passing time. I enjoy reading books about people with special powers; such as necromancers. If we were to take such books that offend someone out of our libraries, what would we have left? I, for one, don't like reading @ORGANIZATION1 books, which seem to be the only type of book that wouldn't offend someone, unless they have some severe hatred towards letters.      Think for a moment about what you like. Think about your interest in music, art, and the style of books or magazines that you read. Now imagine all of those gone from the one place you can get away from screaming children or annoying neighbors: the library. You @MONTH1 be baffled as to why all of your loves have dissappeared. That book you love, the one about necromancers, it's offensive to @CAPS1 because only @CAPS2 has the power of waking the dead. The song that you have had stuck in your head all day is now no longer online. Its use of certain words are offensive to those with 'sensitive' ears.      If I were to walk into a library and find that all the 'offensive' works had been band, I would be shocked. Every one in the universe finds certain things offensive. My @CAPS3 @CAPS4 teacher thinks that rap and hip-hop or pop songs are offensive to women and their bodies, but I think that some of those songs hold a different meaning. If everything offensive were to be taken away, what would be left? Nothing that a teenager or an adult would want to read. Heck, @PERSON1' works are offensive to some people, they think he was crazy, and who wants their children to read a book written by a bafoon?      Also, the less the library contains, the less people go. Libraries would soon close because everything is being found as offensive. All of the books we had hoped to read would have to be bought online, if it were still allowed.     For all of the Book @CAPS5 out there, finding an attention-getting, eye-opening book is like finding buried treasure. It's an event that changes your life, makes your blood rush, and leaves you hanging onto your seat. It's an adventure played in your head, one that you set the specific details of each character, or it's the book that provides the knowledge that feeds your brain every time a new sentence is stored. Taking away everything offensive is like having a child being taken away, you can't replace that love with a distraction"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3920	2	"Certain materials, such as books, music, magizines, etc., should never be removed just because a certain person, or group of people, find it offensive. The authors of these books have the right, as stated in the @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, to have the freedom to say what the wish within the context of their own individual wrighting. Also, certain materials that some people find offensive have little to no offensiveness to many other people who @MONTH1 enjoy the book or movie. Finally, many books that are on the shelves of many of our libraries have no end to the amount of things that @MONTH1 be considered offensive, but allow a certain knowledge to be had by, not only the writer, but the reader as well.      If something is stated in such an important document as the @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, one that set the standard for living and set the laws of a nation to parchment, than it should, for lack of a better term, be taken with the utmost respect and dignity. Several great leaders, such as the first president of the @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2, decided that freedom of the press was a viable asset to a new and growing country. This simple fact alone should hold more than enough levity to allow all materials, no matter how offensive, to not only be published, but also enjoyed by all people. It is this simple freedom that causes books to be published, even written, no matter how offensive they @MONTH1 be.     Certain materials that a person, or group of people, find offensive @MONTH1 not be offensive to everyone. No matter what religion, ethnicity, or moral values you hold, just because it is offensive to you does not mean that it is offensive to everyone. Many people in this world serve in their nations military, ones used to fight more battles than any history book could hold, is just one example that not everyone in this world holds the same morals or ideas that others do, and tensions will always arise because of it. That being said, this also holds true to the way certain people percieve literature and art. @ORGANIZATION3 would hate @ORGANIZATION2's art, and @ORGANIZATION2 would hate @ORGANIZATION3's, however, neither has the right to condone it or to keep it from the eyes of the world.     Many times literature gets removed before their true meaning can be shown to anyone. This is disheartening for several reasons, one being that whatever we, as a human race, could've learned from this piece is now lost forever. Many books could teach the older generations how to leave a legacy for generations to come. Others @MONTH1 teach how future generations can change the world by simply working hard and doing their best. These are best portrayed in books that are sometimes removed from the shelves because of hard lessons or graphic words used.      Is censorship in libraries ok? No. Not at all. All works of literature should be allowed to be read and enjoyed, not only by the author, but also by the young, the old, and all ages in between, of all races and religions. The longer we allow materials to be removed from the shelves of our libraries, the less of a chance we are giving, not only ourselves, but future generations to learn and be all that they can possibly be."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3928	2	"Some books on the shelf at libraries have bad things in it, whether it is what the book is about, the curse words in them, or just not very aproprit for some of the age groups. Should the books at the libraries be censored or should we just leave them for the reader to decide if they want to read it or not?     I dont think any of the books, or magazines should be censered. If some one wants to read a book with curse words in it or anything like that then let them. The parents @MONTH1 not let some kids read them but some parents just dont care. I think if they read them they might say them but they will learn not to say them and that they are not very nice to say.       Should the movies you get at libraries be censered? I dont think they should because the parents arent going to let them get it or watch the movie if they dont think it is something they need to be watching. The kids know what they can and cant watch so if it is something they know they cant watch then they shouldnt get it. The kids might get it but the parents could take it away and tell them they cant watch it.      Should all books.magazines, music, or movies from libraries be censered? No. If it is a library at school everything has to be school approprit. If the book, movie, magazine, or music is not approprit they the school cant lone it out. A public library can but there are mostly adults there. The kids should know what they can and cant watch, read, or listen to, so they should know better than to get something they cant read, watch, listen to, or look at. Some parents @MONTH1 agree to censering them but if you do that you are limiting the books everyone can read. Even the parents or adults wouldnt be able to read them aswell"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3930	2	"To censor, or not to censor? That is the question. I am positive that there are a great amount of different views portaining to this topic. Everyone will have very good points on either using, or not using censorship in the library. Although this is true, I believe that there are many more valid reasons not to use censorship in libraries. First of all, how offensive can library material truly be?     I do not believe that is very offensive at all. There will be movies and material specifically designed for a mature an older age group. This is fine; if the person choosing the material is of age then he or she should have no reason not to choose advanced material. A mature person will not want to read elementary books their entire life. Sooner or later, they will have to be intruduced into the real life. It would not be beneficial to them or society if they are sheltered their entire lives. Also, if the person is still a child, there should be no reason for a child to choose the older level of material. There @MONTH1 be times when he does; however, this is not a problem because all the parent has to do is explain to him that he is not of age yet. This is an easy fix. As I said earlier, ther is no reason we all need to read the same thing.     Variety is what makes libraries apealing to the customers. Who would want to go to a library with all the same books? I myself would not. Within the library, there are sections specifically just for children. If all the slightly offensive material was to be taken out of libraries, that would eliminate a large portion of the customers. Also, this would discourage writers from even producing thier material; thus hindering their income and motivation. We have freedom and choice in @LOCATION1, and I feel this would go against @CAPS1 values if they were to induce censorhip in a harmless library.      No one is perfect and we all make mistakes. However, we can also improve and learn from them. If a person does choose an inapropriate book, they will most likely learn and improve from their mistake. We have a choice about what to choose when we go into the library. I believe if not all, the majority of the time we make the right choice.     Libraries are a supercenter of learning and information. This would not be true if certain portions of information began to be removed. I have had many worthwhile times in the library and was never once harmed or offended. Libraries are here to help and not to hinder our learning. I am most likely not the only one who feels pleased with the way libraries are now and feel no need to change what is good"	3	4		3	3	4	3																		
3935	2	"Leave @CAPS1 on the Shelves                                             In every library it is intitle to have all types of books, movies, and magazines.Even if they are good or bad. Not everyone in this world is going to have the same likings.If there are people that are offened of what types of sources they find in the library I don't think it should be taken off of the shelves. Everyone in able to agree or disagree in what types of things they like.      If the library didn't how would people learn about things today that are going on in this world, because not everything that is said on television is true. Every library in the world should not take certian books, movies, and magazines down just so kids or anyone else can't read @CAPS1 or watch @CAPS1 because there might be other people who would like to read @CAPS1 or watch @CAPS1. If the libraries took down certain books, movies, and magazines then it shouldn't even be called a library because it is suppose to have all types of sources.     Not everyone is going to have the same opinion on whether or not certain books,movies, or magazines should be in the library, but all types of these sources should stay in the library beacuse if they are offensive to some people there aren't going to be like that for everyone so that wouldnt't be fair for the other people who enjoy reading, looking at magazines to see whats new ,or watching all different types of moive, and listening to music.     I think that the librarians should not take anything down in their libraries because they know what they are doing when they put those sources on the shelves and also they should stay on the shelves because if they didn't want people to feel offended then they wouldn't have made books, moive, or magazine that would offend people today.     Libraries don't leave the sources on the shelves on perpose for people to feel offended, they leave @CAPS1 for other people to read.With this being said all types or books, magazines, or movies should be left on the shelves to help other people learn what they want to learn about"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3937	2	"Picture for yourself you, as a @NUM1 year old child sitting in front of one of the greatest philosophers of history, @LOCATION1. Days later, you come to find out that he has been killed for 'corrupting the minds of the children.' @CAPS1 what? One of the greatest minds in human history has been censored because they didn't like his ideas. This is censorship at a basic level, and it happens to millions of books, movies, and songs every day. Censorship is not only wrong, its unnecessary. Here's why.     @CAPS1, when it comes down to it, most books, movies, and songs are meant to be interpreted in many different ways. For example, some poems are written with a vague tone so that they can be interpreted in different ways based upon the person. Besides, most music and books are meant to entertain, not offend. Granted, some books are meant to be interpreted in a certain way, but that still doesn't mean that they were meant to offend. Think about it next to you look at a copy of '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' by @PERSON1; is it really that offensive to you?     When you are given a book in school for a class assignment, they usually expect you to read it because its of some educational value to you. Books like 'To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5' provide a huge educational value because they show what @CAPS6 culture was like, but everyday, someone new is trying to get it off the shelves of every school library in @LOCATION2 because they find it offensive. Ask yourself, is it right? The answer for me is no, since books like that hold an educational value that outweighs their offensiveness.     There's one last thing you must understand, and that is the fact that no matter how many books you take off the shelves, and no matter how many movies you ban, or how many songs you take away from us, the problem still isn't solved, its just been suppressed enough for different problems to arise, and those problem are that there are people who wanted to read this book @CAPS1 can't because you thought it was offensive. @CAPS1 this person complains to whomever banned this form of literature, and the book or other form of literature is put back on the shelves. @CAPS1 you feel it right to try and ban it again, but what does that solve? Nothing. Even if someone doesn't unban it, people can still teach and tell of what its about, making the ban worthless.     I hope that before you think about complaining about some book you found offensive, you think about this. Your complaint that causes the banning affects everyone. It affects a teacher's ability to teach, and a student's ability to learn. Is it really right of you to take away a good teaching material? Or you could ask yourself, what does it really solve? Either way, you still must know that bannig these things in wrong."	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
3939	2	"There are many inapropriate types of intertainment in the world but does that mean we should take them all away? I believe that censoring things such as books, movies and music in a library is not a good idea. We would not have any diversity in the world or any type of intertainment because everyone has a different view on what they think is offensive or inapropriate.     With censoring materials in a library it will extremly limit on what we can learn. For example if someone thought that a book about how an animal catches it pray was offensive then if a person was interested in learnig about that topic they would not able to. Many peoples only way of reserch is at a library, so if they had on assignment for work and they could only get informatoin on it there they would not be able to finish their job if only one person thought a book about that topic was offincive. Also people in the medical feild have to watch many movies deminstrating sertain proseedures. What would they do if one person thought that a movie on what they were doing was offensive? They might not be able to save a persons life.     With censoring there would be no diverstiy. Censoring would cause us to have a very small choise in what we could read for intertainment. It might even cause us to not have any books to read for intertainment because it one person does not like a sertain book it can be gotten rid of. So if not all the books are gone there is still going to be a few books to chose from. It would cause all to read the same books therefor making the diverstiy very small.     I see only a few good points in censoring. Yes, it would prevent children from learning or hearing about inapropriate or offensive things but, that is what is in our world and i believe that we just have to accept it. Our society today is filled with crime, haterid, sexually things, and profanity but there is no changing that. Censoring @MONTH1 hide that for a small amount of time but its not going to keep it away forever. Censoring is not going to change our society.     I do not think that we should censor thing in our libaries. It can only lead to a downfall in our communitys. It is a great idea but i do not believe that it can help us more than it would hurt us. Censoring will cuz a lack in diversity education and a realization of our society"	4	3		4	3	3	3																		
3944	2	"Should you conceal a child from the inappropriate half of the world? Not letting them hear, see, or read the bad in the world. Letting them grow up as innocent as possible. Should libraries take these procautions?     In a world like ours were bad things happen everyday when it comes to people comminting suicide, being murdered, goverment scams, and even terrorist attacks its hard to keep people that shouldnt know, from knowing. It is very easy for our nation to figure things out, all we have to do is watch @CAPS1.V. or even go to our local library. While we already censor what goes onto our television, we dont think to care as much for our libraries. Our libraries have anything from thousands of book and magizines and now having an equal, or more, amounts of movies, @CAPS2, and videogames.     I think a library should have censorship when it comes to what they have and how they organize it. There should be different sections of libraries, much like they do now, of age groups and what is appropriate for them, and to avoid people checking-out items that are from sections above them they have an age group security check on the libraries card fileing system. This sounds very complicated but at least we are doing as much as possible for trying not to expose anyone to anything they are to young for.     When it comes to offensive material, I think that should not be taken off the shelf but put into a different place in the library. Some people need to read some thing they find offensive, maybe they need to read it for a class, maybe the book is offensive but needs to be read because it teaches a very good life lesson. There is a book that is called '@CAPS3' its by a man with the last name of @LOCATION1. It sounds very offensive but it actually teaches people the origin of the word and how it came to be offensive to people. It @MONTH1 be offensive for some people to read but it teaches a lesson in why people shouldnt say it.     Yes, there are always going to be some parents out there that don'@CAPS1 care as much when it comes to what there child read, watches, listens to, or plays. But, for there kids to get it, there parents will have to come and get it for them, that way the parents know what they are extracting from the library."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3957	2	"As an individual and what books I have read, I believe some books needs to be taken off the shelf. My concern is for the children who get a hold of these books. Kids should be kids and wait till they're older and more mature to know about certain things. This also includes music, movies, and magazines. Some people believe these things influence bad behavior like stealing, cussing, and even murder. The less obsene matterial we have the better we can control our kids or at least some of them anyway.         We see bad behavior every day like stealing, cussing, murder, and assault. Ever wonder what causes people to do it? Just look around you they show it in movies, they talk about it in books. theres even songs about it, no wonder kids think its okay to do these kind of things! If we limit these items we @MONTH1 see positive results.     Like I said before kids should be kids and be free of these obsene materials. They will be exposed to it sometime but hopefully when they're older. In the mean time censors should be put on these items or taken off the shelf."	2	2		2	3	3	3																		
3960	2	"In a way many books are put on the library shelf for a reason. Some of the books take race, sexism, bullying, ect., to extreme. Putting myself in a child's shoes when they read those books, magazines, movies, music, ect., would have to be scary. The languages in movies and music are not what we think they are. Would you want your child, that's @NUM1, to go out and do what the other @NUM1 year olds do because they think it is cool for others to do?     Remember back in the days when you were young and your parents didn't have to worry about what you were doing because your generation wasn't like the generations now? Well, these generations to come will probably get worse if we don't do something about it now. Taking some books off a shelf, or taking profanities out of a song will not hurt a child or teenager one bit. These things are telling your children it is ok to have sex, smoke, drink, or even cuss.      I know that my mother worries about me @NUM3, because she's always calling me to check up on me and asking how my day was, or if i had any problems today. If we work together on taking care of all of the profanities then i bet the world would be a much safer and nicer place. Bullying wouldn't be a problem anymore; neither would cyer space or the drugs and alcohol. You need to step up and show your children that doing those things are not exceptable or nessesary in any life. Remember them that there is a whole life out there without the sex, drugs, and profanities.     So, the next time you think that your going to buy a dvd or a cd preview it before you buy it. Make sure that if your child listened to it that it wouldnt be hurtful or have any profanities in it. Make sure that you talk to your child about what is right and wrong. Lets make these profanities go away on their own. If they aren't something you want your child to listen to then you shouldn't listen to it either"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3961	2	"Browsing for a book at your local library that you've read, wanting to reread @CAPS1 to enjoy the sounds of its words again? You look shelf after shelf, not locating @CAPS1 anywhere. You searched everywhere, by everything that the book would possibly be listed under. You've browsed paper backs, hard backs; eventually letting your frustration take over.Giving up on locating the novel, you walk over to the librarian and ask about @CAPS1. She replies with, 'I'm sorry, we had to remove that particular novel due to a person finding @CAPS1 offensive to them.' You're infuriated, you decide to write a article to your local newspaper about the outrage of the books, movies, music, etc. that has been taken out of your local library.     Personally, I don't think that the media taken away from the library should be considered offensive. How can you consider what is offensive and what is not? A book could be offensive to one person, but not another. Different people have different opinions, and @CAPS1's not reasonable to remove a book or other type of media from a library because @CAPS1 contains 'offensive material.' @CAPS1's ridiculous; @CAPS1 infuriates me that someone would do that. If you think @CAPS1 could get into the hands of a child, or someone that @CAPS1 would effect, do not rent the item. That's why at most libraries, there are seperate areas for adults and children so that children don't obtain these items.     How can you determine if something is offensive? I personally don't find a lot of things offensive, but just because something is offensive to me, doesn't mean I will request to have @CAPS1 banned so that other people can't enjoy @CAPS1. If you find something offensive, just leave @CAPS1 alone. Don't bother, annoy, or hassle someone else that had nothing to do with its creation with @CAPS1. @CAPS1's not only disrepectful to the individual you file a complaint to, but the artist who created @CAPS1. You do have the right to voice your opinion, but sometimes, @CAPS1 doesn't have to voiced.     We live in such a closed-minded world. We have people who don't even think @CAPS1's approprite to show one's arm. I can see why some people take offense to these things, but honestly, @CAPS1's mediocre to report something just becuase you do not agree with @CAPS1. We have a vast knowledge of what's right or wrong, what is or is not appropriate for an audience to hear. If @CAPS1 weren't appropriate, you honestly think @CAPS1 would have been published? Sure there are things in book, music, etc. that are inappropriate, but to be so closed-minded to have something banned for use of foul language, minor sexual content, or violence is unlogical. You can find worse, hear worse, just by walking down the street just about anywhere.     To answer the question bluntly, no, I do not think that media should be banned just because @CAPS1 is offensive. We as @CAPS2 have the right to speak our voice, from two different perspectives. You can argue if something is mediocre, is offensive; I will argue back, just because I have the right to voice my opinion as you do. These reasons that enjoyable media are banned, such as language and violence, add emphasis, meaning, emotion, and make the reader dig for so much more in a book, song, etc. These are how the authors see their work, they want to show the people what they see, even if @CAPS1 does offend someone else."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3962	2	"Imagine that a person comes up to you and says, '@CAPS1 is that you are reading there? Wait, I know that book! That book is absolutely offensive! How dare you read that!' Then, imagine that they snatch that book up, and you never see it again. This is an example of how censorship works. If the government notices citizens in our country with offensive magazines, books, movies, or music, is it right for them to grab it away? No, not in any way do they have a right to do that!      Everybody should be able to decide for themselves @CAPS1 is right or wrong to; watch, read, or hear. Nobody has to be exposed to anything that they don't want to. Also, if a person truley wants to find an offensive form of entertainment, they will find it, no matter if it is legal to or not. Therefore, I believe that trying to stop people from this is a fruitless action.     Remember when you would get to listen to your favorite bedtime story, '@CAPS2 The @ORGANIZATION2'? Well, you can't read it anymore, the government declared the book offensive to camels and took it away. Now, you have only a boring book on facts about camels. @CAPS1 fun is that? And I have to think, '@CAPS1 about the authors?' @CAPS4 thing that is amazing about our country is our freedom of speech and expression! Stopping all that creativity from our author is tough and cruel. Writing a great story is near impossible to accomplish with limitaions that could result from government censorship.     If a song is beautiful and sweet, but contains @CAPS4 bad word in it, is it a bad song? If there was censorship, who would decide @CAPS1 is appropiate? Would the @CAPS5 decide for us? Or would the @ORGANIZATION1 get together and read aloud the books before they were declared inappropiate? Personally, I would love to decide for myself. And, as a mature adult, I can. I have the morals and the mind to choose for myself @CAPS1 is good or bad.     Perhaps, the multitude of books and songs that we have now would disappear altogether. It is possible. It is incredibly difficult to imagine the entire country having the same moral opinions on our entertainment. This could cause a number of entertainment forms to be eliminated. So, how can we create a standard to approve these forms of entertainment?     Understanding that there are young, fragile children, that are privy to all forms all public entertainment, some censorship @MONTH1 be required. However, I strongly believe that this should be limited. The censorship should be used only to help the kids. This is similar to the way a parent has their children eat healthy food instead of junk as they are growing up. When the kids are grown, they decide for themselves @CAPS1 food to eat. Some of the items I believe should be censored are; public commercials, children's television shows, and children's movies. The things I, and many others, believe should be censored are; profanity, violence, and offensiveness toward race, religion, and gender. Later, these children will be able to chose for themselves @CAPS1 they think is acceptable, and the censorship can end.     Total censorship is bad. Each and every citizen has the right to read whatever they please to. And nobody should ever try to take that away. Please, don't ever let people tell you your own morals."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3963	2	"Many Libraries today have limits on what they can put on their shelves.  Yes, their is offensive material out there in the world but, its just artists triing to make a name for themselves.  If we start controlling each others thoughts, feelings, and artist ability where will that get our culture that is rapidly expanding?  Libraries should not have the right to censor material.      One way to appeal to everyones demands would be to divide the library into two major sections childrens and adults and then you could contiue dividing sections.  Doing this would be cost-effective and adding a   age limit in the adult section so no noisy children could get into there would be nice.  It would help making finding a book easier for finding that right book.     Censorship is defined as taking out a paticular item, thats either offensive to a certain group or is banned.  If someone took out @PERSON2's @PERSON3 statue and other peices of work, we wouldnt get where we would be today.  If you take out material you never know where it could go or lead someone.  Censorship holds back many artists true potential.  Limiting someones knowledge could hurt that persons chance at becoming something in this world.     I have read many books that are both offensive in ways and other books about knowledge and intelligence and their is no difference. Many things interest different people. The author Katherine Paterson's quote explains this all to well if someone has a right to remove a book from the shelf than everyone has a right to remove a material off a shelve and so there would be no books left.  Censoring something not only hurts the person who created it but hurts everyone else.     Libraries should not censorship any material. Censoring material hurts everyones yearn for a open mind or a better understanding of something.  As Katherine Paterson's quote goes 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 explains that if one person has a right to take a material off a shelf than everyone else has that right.   Censorship shouldnt be in libraries."	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
3968	2	Isn't there a saying in the world called its a free country? I thought it wasthere are alot of things that people should not see in the world. But we find ways to see it anyway no matter what it is the world has so many sources to get the truth or maybe even lie's to the world we live in. From the media to the press to poparasi maybe even from the people around you they all help the cause of things that should not be being seen by the people.          There thing's out there that we the people don't know nothing about that the goverment and world shields from our eyes. Then there's the things that we are showin by the world like @PERSON1 alot of people think what happend to him is offensive. Not only that but racisim in general also the news why would people put violent things on the news like murder storys and kidnapping and robberys and many more. People find that offensive and even scary to alot of people but yet we keep it on there.                                                                  So no i don't think it should not be removed from shelves and or were ever all things found to be offensive to people are located. Just like when that marine died and gay supportors and protestors were near his funeral chanting with (offensive) thing's. Say thank god for dead soldiers and god hates the army. Nobody stopped that. If we as people are not going to come togeather and work with one another about the things that should or should not be displayed then whats the point of telling someone else what is offensive to you when your going to end up doing it to. And your going to do it with out a care in the world not thinking about who your hurting . Everyone has and opinion and wants to demained it but people are diffrent and some will always see it diffrent than what you see it.                                                       So if you see something offensive in a book or movie or outside. Dont watch it dont read it dont try to hear about it from a friend or stranger leave it alone. We put so much effort into hearing about these offensive things when all you had to do was leave it alone. And then you wouldnt have even known about it. Live life and dont worry about the negative lets focus on the positive of what you see.	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3971	2	"Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. I believe that even if books, music, movies or magazines on the bookshelves are offense, they should still be left there. They are apart of our history and the history we're creating.     If anyone wants to read a certain book or magazine, there's a big chance they will end up reading it. There are so many ways to get to those things with the technology we have today. You could just look them up online and read them or listen to them off the computer.     Also, censoring in libraries, where everyone feels tranquil and comfortable, can make people rebel and even put the library out of business.     From what i've observed, most people look up inappropriate or offensive things on the internet already. Especially if they know that it's something that could be debated about being censored.     A lot of books and movies, great ones even, contain some offensive content but they are classics. Generations, one after the other, have enjoyed them.     Now tell me, who would want to be the unreasonable person and take that away from anyone who is interested? Everyone should have the right to these books, magazines, movies, and music. Libraries should not censor them."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3972	2	"Libraries are full of all different sorts of books, movies and magazines.  These books, movies, and magazines @MONTH1 come across as offensive to some people. Parents might not want their children to see certain books or movies. Does this mean we should take thoughs offensive books off the shelf?      If everyone decided to take one book or movie they think was inappropriate off the shelf, there would be nothing left in the library. Books contain adventures and life lessons that kids and adults need. Young Children need books to help their imagination grow.  If there was not anymore books in the library, children would not be able to learn or grow. Movies are just like books but for young children it is easier to visualize a movie rather then a book. If the book or movie is found offensive to you, pick another, but it should not be removed from the shelf.  One book or movie @MONTH1 seem offensive to you, but @MONTH1 not to another person.     A world without books. No imagination. No adventures. It would be a boring world.  I would rather have a few offensive books then none at all. That way I can learn and see character's adventures through my own eyes"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3974	2	"I do not think that censoship has a ightful place in our librares. I know that libraries were created to be information! hubs for the public. If censorship were put in place, then many books would be gone as they @MONTH1 be seen as offensive to a  minority of people................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................"	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
3981	2	"Remain on the Shelf?     Certain materials such as books, music, magazines and more can often contian offensive information that many would want censored. The people writing the items are not making them so that they are just plain offensive, the way people take in information is the main factor. People choose whether or not to believe certain things for themselves, and with those come their personal opinions. Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive, this could create more problems with the public and those who disagree on what has been taken out, that dont consider them to be offensive.     What is offensive to one person, @MONTH1 not be offensive to the next. Items being removed because of a complaint made by one person should not even be considered. Whether it be a book, magazine, or music the author had a purpose for it and it was not intended on hurting someone's feelings. For example, a book about slavery could be offensive to a white man, but a black man would consider it to be about his history. People can find many things offensive by just reading titles, or listening to one lyric from as song, but that does not mean they have to read the book or keep listening to the song. Someone else is enjoying the book and the song could be what another person looks forward to everyday.     These magazines and books could also be seen as informing. The material in a certian magazine @MONTH1 not be acceptable by some, but a lot of new information can come from them. If everything found offensive was removed from the shelves there would most likley be nothing left. Removing them could cause choas to someone who is trying to learn more about a disease, when another person who is suffering from it does not want their story told. Certian materials being offensive can only offend so many, and chances are what doesnt offend them offends the next person. Informing articles and books should not be removed from shelves in libraries because they are there just to provide a source of knowledge.     Censoring in libraries would also take away from those who are just interested. A lot of people like to read and rent movies just for fun, but chances are if the book or movie does not sound interesting, it is not going to make any profit. What is considered offensive to a person could be the interest of another. From my experience teenagers are interested in alot of action and romantic films and books. They often times contain alot of physical and sexual content along with a decnt amount of foul language. A older person would not be interested in the foul language and content, they would consider them to be offensive to either the girl or boy in the story and would wonder why it is even being read. Most would even say that the books and movies can be degrading to some, but it is what interests teens and makes them want to read more becasue they can't wait to see what is going to happen next. Removing items such as these would push teens away from reading and viewing alot of movies because nothing then would spark their interest.     Scenes and facts in materials that could be offensive to a person are usually not intended to be. People are not being made to read and watch what offends them. Everybody is different and what offends my neighbor @MONTH1 not offend me. Chances are that there will alwasy be something that is going to offend at least one person. The more we all get used to it , the less many people will actually run into items that offend them. They @MONTH1 still be offended on the insided but it won't matter because they will have realized that not everybody is offended by the same thing"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3984	2	"Many people think that libraries should be censored in one form or another to keep certian types of book away from people. How does that really help? Even if you remove certian book or music from a library doesn't mean people won't still get that same information from somewhere else. Besides many of the things that people should be censored is probably not that bad. I think it is better for some one to read about somthing the have it happen to them and then experince it. Like Katherine Paterson said if we let people get rid of book of music that they think are bad for people to read or listen to what will we have left. Nothing! Through people think censorring libraries is for the greater good, it just has too many bad side to have much of a good effect.     When people try to censor things they normally just take things off of shelfs and get rid of them. But, in today world of technology that doesn't stop people from obtaining there goal. We have the internet that lets people upload book and music to share. So yeah, you many not be able to get a book at the library but you can almost always find it online. In result trying to censor libraries by removing books and music really is doing anything.     How do you determine what should be censored? People all have a different idea of what is ok for the public and what is not. Some book that get removed could insult a group of people because it related in some way to them. Then you loss business and make poeple mad at the same time. In some way isn't it better for people to learn about bad things like crime and death through ways that aren't real and don't hurt. When things like that happen in a book they normally don't just stop there. They show the results or how the situation was handled. Which could come to help people who end up in the same sort of situatuions later on it there life. Which makes it really hard to determine what should be censored and what shouldn't.     Katherrine Paterson even said that if we let people censor what they think is unmoral nothing will be left. Everything will be gone, because every person in the world would find something is every book that they could find bad. Even if there is a book that people agree should be censored, there are people that think the other way. No books would be left if we  censored libraries because people could find thing bad or unmoral in every book.      Overall, censoring libraries ends up being more pain than it worth. It is not stoping people from obtaining the information another way. There is no way to decide what shuld be censored. And, censoring somethings will lead to people wanting other things to be censored, which will leave nothing. In conclusion, censoring doesn't really stop people and ends up leading to bigger problems in the end."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3987	2	"In this essay I am going to write about the books about the librabries. Also if they are books that can be offensive and that it can or not be removed by the libraries.I think that the libraries have the right to have any materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, and more on the shelves. Well in my opinion I think that they should not remove any books because people @MONTH1 think that it can be offensive but other people @MONTH1 be into those books. So no I don't think they should remove any because some people have different opinions on different books.When I go to libraries they are books that I can enjoy reading or not like but that is just my opinion. Some people might like the book that I did not liked or hate but I think that the books should not be removed from the shelves because some people might enjoy it and some won't.I think they should not remove books because the books are for people that are interseted on the books that they want to read or learn about the stuff about the past or just fiction books.I just talked about the essay I just wrote I talked about the books about the libraries, and how some books can be offensive to other people that are trying to pick books, and also if they should or not remove books from the shelves"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3990	2	"Censorship is a tough topic to discuss. Everyone has different views on what is and isn't acceptable in libraries, because of the content in some books, music, movies, and magazines. When you start to censor what information is available to certain people, they get angry, and it can cause an uproar of protest. There should be an age limit on some materials however. So how can you tell what is okay for younger children and teens to view?     For movies, music, and magazines, there are already limitations on how old you have to be to buy or rent them. With movies, the rule in libraries should be the same as anywhere else. It should be that you must be seventeen to get anything rated @CAPS1. I'm not sure what the age is to view unrated movies is, but for libraries it shoulld be the same as anything else. Anything else, should be open to all ages.     Music is also a controversial material to censor. If a @CAPS2 has an explicit label on it, you should have to be eighteen to check it out. The reason being, is that some music can contain violent lyrics, and unless you are eighteen you shouldn't listen to it. When you hear music that is offensive to you, you must be smart enough to not listen to it. Anything any artist wants to say on a @CAPS2 can be recorded, and children should not be exposed to that until they are responsible enough to know what they should, and sometimes shouldn't be listening to.     Printed materials are the hardest to censor. Personally, i don't believe any book should be kept from anyone. The only type of book that should be kept from some people is magazines. Once again, magazines can contain some graphic content, and should only be kept from anyone under eighteen. There are just some things kids shouldn't see, but if you are a legal adult, and want to read any kind of book, it should be available to you.     With any of these materials, it should all be available to you in a library. It is a place to learn about how a writer, a movie director, a music artist, or magazine editor feels about the world. If we censor the material in a library, it is denying the public of the real world. Also, we would be revoking the right given to us of free speech. I do not make fun of books because I know whatever someone writes down, in their eyes, is the truth. It is an expression of self, and to stop someone's work from being available to the world, you are taking away the right of free speech."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3992	2	"Cursing, violence, gang activity, murder, ect. All of these  are factors found in our books and music we have today. Do you believe these items should be cencered? If books or music have these types of messages in them it is going to influence children and adult's choices on what they do in life. I feel that, yes books and music should be cencored.          My first supporting reason of why books and music should be cencored is the fact that children and adults get a huge influence from the information. Look in today's world; murders are happening, gang violence, and even abuse. If a book or song is advertising about murdering some one, or selling drugs nine times out of ten people think that is the 'cool' thing to do so why not do it. With people following uncencored books and songs it leaves dead people, inmates, and poor choices. Most people want to follow what an artist or author is doing because they are famous, which is causing peer preasure.     The second reason books and music should be censored is the simple fact of respect. Some books or music affends people by their race, religion, or their apperance. You find most of the critizisium from music more than books, but it does occur. Young children and teens shouldn't listen to or read about racism, sex, how to drugs, ect. Books and music that have advertisment about these types of things is disrespectful to parents and what they teach their children. The message brought from the book or song is basically saying go against your parents and do this. A person should be able to sit and listen to a nice song, or book without getting disrespected and offended.     My final reasoning for books and music being cencored is the reputation it will have or has. Books and music are just like people, they can send off the wrong message leaving a bad reputation upon others. For instance, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 tend to have a lot of bad messaged songs, so therefore most people think that all @CAPS3 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are bad. If songs and books were cencored there wouldn't be a sterio type against a certain type of music, or books have the best message. A normal person bases the first song, or book they hear/read by if or not they or their child can listen to or read that type of material.      Love, positive messages, influencing good, these are the types of things most people want to hear or read. If books and music are cencored there will not be any more cursing on the radio, bad ideas given to those influenced, and could stop less violence. Again I state, yes I feel books and music should be cencored."	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
3995	2	"Can you think of a book that you hope none of your children or any other children have taken off the shelf? But if you had the right to remove the book would you? I believe if I found a book, magazine, any type of  music, or a movie offensive I would not remove it, because everyone has a right to their own opinion, even if it is offensive. Also, instead of removing the materials completely, why not remake them into a more suitable manner to where they are less offensive.     First, noone should have the right to remove materials they find offensive. Because if people were allowed to do that the world would have no music, books, movies, magazines or anything to intertain ourselves. Also it would start a big fight because alot of people do not find certain things offensive like other people do, and when the people that find materials offensive start removing things that other people dont find offensive, a big riot will start.     secondly, why would you start removing materials if it could be remade into a more suitable manner? maybe instead of removing everything, why not find the publisher and see if the could make it @NUM1 or less vaulger. Same with music, movies, and magazines.     So to conclusion everyone has a right to their own opinion, no matter if it is offensive or not. I think if i came across something that offended me I wouldnt do anything about it. Because maybe that person who wrote the book, or movie was expressing how they feel, and you can not tell someone how to feel or express themselves. So instead of removing materials off shelves consider that someone was just expressing how they feel and have the right to their own opinion just like you do"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4013	2	"I believe that there should be censorship in public libraries. Libraries have families and young children going to them that do not need to see, hear, and read certain things. If people would like to buy inapporpriate reading material, movies, or music they can do that elsewhere. Certain things are acceptable in public libraries and other things are not.     Certain material such at rated @CAPS1 movies and romance novels are not inappropriate or unacceptable. They are meant for adults but they are not showing extremely racy pictures on their covers. Other material, however, most people are not interested in having to see and our young children should not be subjected to that.     People that wish to view, listen to, or read inappropriate material that is not meant for all ages or covers shouldn't even be viewed by young children can and will purchase or find them elsewhere. People that wish to possess these items will find another place to get them besides a public place with families and children. I believe these people reserve the right to view and listen to what they would like but they should be censored in a public library.     Most people don't read inappropriate material in public and most extremely racy movies aren't even shown in theatres so why should you be able to check them out in a public place? Besides that many people do not even want other people to know that they are viewing these objects in the first place so many wouldn't even check them out at a public library.     I also believe that not only should children not be subjected to these things but parents should not be subjected to their children wanting to know what certain things are that they are far to young to know about.     The youth of @LOCATION1 is getting into new things younger and younger daily whether that be drugs or inappropriate magazines so I believe that we should not begin subjecting our children to that at an even younger age than they will already find out about it."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4014	2	"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 the author, Katherine Paterson. Her quote means that there might be a book, magazine, etc., on a shelf that someone shouldn't see. I beleive that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are ways people can avoid seeing them. I think that if something is found offensive then they should be in a special aisle.     First off, if there are items that people find offensive then they should be placed in a specific aisle. There are things that only adults should see so therefore there should be an aisle dedicated to the offensive or inapropriate things. And for someone to get into that aisle they should have permission to get into the aisle and show and I.D. so that kids and children don't accidently slip in and see things they shouldn't. Because if a child sees something bad, then that might influence them to do bad things because they won't know any better.     Secondly, if an indivual finds a book or magazine offensive, then they can avoid it by simply walking away. That person doesn't have to read it or look for it in a library if it's in a certain aisle. But if someone is really offended by something then all they have to do is go complain to the person head of the library and it can simply be removed if there are enough compaints. Then again, it's not that hard to avoid something you don't like. It might bother you that it's there, but it should be out of the way for younger kids to see.     Thirdly, the library will contain things that are found either offensive or inapropriate so children entering the library should have adult supervision so that they don't see the bad things. If a child sees something bad, they might find it interesting so they might want to pick it up and read it, which is bad because it might give them ideas.     Finally, there are many ways to avoid seeing something you find offensive. You can walk away if you notice something you find offensive or you stay away from that area of the library. There are going to be many things out there that people find offensive and inapropriate, but there's not much you can do about it. The best thing to do is ignore it and walk away. And if you're that concerned about it then you can always make a complaint about what has offended you or what you think is inapropriate for children. Putting bad things in an aisle is a smart idea because little kids won't be able to access it."	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
4016	2	"As a fellow person of the community and a person who often vists the libray, I think that books,magazines,movies,etc., should not be taken off the shelf. The reason for this thought is because, although it @MONTH1 be offensive to one person does not mean it's offensive to another. Taking various books and items away from our libraries takes away from many peoples' knowledge of our world. This in turn makes the world illiterate.     Libraries provide multiple things that are not family disscreation but, to the right age group offers alot of knowledge. Movies are a large portion of this problem but, they are there do to entertainment  reasons. I feel that all items that are equipped in a library should be looked at as a way of knowledge and not as weither it is offensive to a certain quanity of people. The removal of these things @MONTH1 become harmful to a new generation in the long run.     I personally think as a person who attends the library often, that things being taken away cause uproar in different ways.  I have read multiple books that have been aquired from all different sections of the library. Some even pertainig to racism of my own ethinticity that uses words that are not to my liking. I tolerate with the words do to the fact that I would like to know what my ancestory had to do in order for me to get where I am today.             Magazines are also a small portion of this conflict. As like movies though they are there to provide entertainment. Most people like to use the library for a time of relaxtion. The library is not just there for people to take books and other things it also there so that people can have a comfortable place to learn something.      In conclusion, As a fellow person of the community and a frequent library attende, I think that things should not be taking off of shelves. Libraries provides various things that are not at a family disccreation level but, @MONTH1 provide help to other people. Some books pertain to racism of ethnitcity. It's not meant to be harmful but to show what your ancestor had to endure to get your where you are. Things like magazines are there for your entertainment and if you think it's inappropriate then you should'nt read or watch it."	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
4019	2	"The shelf is an object that holds many types of diffierent materials such as movies, books, magazines, and music. Its all media and entertainment. But not everyone likes the media because one or all of these materials @MONTH1 be offensive towards the foriegn and children.     Censorship in our libraries could get a little graphic and such. Yes we all the it in movies and music, but we do not want it in our libraries. A library is a place for study and learning for educational purposes. There are not for entertainment and things of that nature. Sometimes they could be a little fun but for the most part, people would like to take there children and show them something to help there minds focus on school. By all @CAPS1 rated @CAPS2 movies, dirty music, adult books and magzines should be taken off the shelves.      One day as I was in the state library looking on the shelves for a book on @LOCATION1 and its people. As I was reading the book, it said some very mean and offensive things about the @CAPS3 people. I thought to myself that this book should be takken of the shelves forever and never seen again. It shocked me that someone would put that book in a public library and let the foreign and others read it. After some people read about the @CAPS3 people; They had second thoughts and started get angey and disliking them for theses things and offensive comments made!     Magazines and movies should be taken of the shelves in the catagories in my opinion of the poeple in different countries and the way they live. That could be very sad for someone because they could of really went through everything in that movie or what ever that magzines says. Another reason censorship should be under control is the titles to these materials. If a child looks at an adult film and it happens to be for a child, wouldnt you think thats a little offensive? I know I would. There is no way I want my child watching some violet movie.      We have to think for our children and the people that come in form different countries when it comes to public libraries. If censorship is not observed carfully then we could make the foriegners very angry or make our children become very violet and reckless because of the films on the shelves, and the people that come in to our country would never come back if they picked up the book that they might of thought that was int interesting but turns out to be very offensive in there opinion. Censorship is very imprtant in libraries and on the shelves"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4026	2	"Does censorship solve any problems?  If one person wants to censor something in a library, there is bound to be another person on the other side of that arguement  trying to protect that work from be taken away.  As a free country, it is every individuals right to take in whatever form of literature or music that they find pleasing, and history has shown the world that censorship leads those in power down a dark road.  The shielding of offensive materials is only necessary and fair when the young, impressionable minds of the world's youth are at stake, but once a person is old enough to make informed decisions, it should be their perrogative to choose their own material.  Censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history, but necessary when protecting the young.     It is a person's right to choose what kind of literature they would like to read.  If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned.  For example take a hypothetical public library: a public library is an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music.  A great mental image of serenity and peace.  How does this picture appear to a bystander once books begin to disappear off of the shelves?  Suddenly right and left, books are disappearing as if by magic: a ceratin book is disapproved of by mothers, a religious group does not like the message this book sends, and this book makes people sad.  Before long, there are not very many books left in this hypothetical library other than books for toddlers.  With this system, everyone suffers.  Everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to.  It would all just be simpler if book were just not banned from libraries.     History has given the world many a cruel dictator.  Oftentimes, once he comes to power, he is not the most popular of governmental forms.  To keep his subjects underneath his rule, often he has to resort to taking away civil rights.  This could be a curfew, fake elections, or censorship.  If the ruler has the power of censorship, he or she can control what the public thinks, feels, and believes.  With this power over them, the people are weakened and often abused.  Now imagine that censorship occuring in a country that has civil rights.  People would not stand for it.  So why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom?  There is absolutely no need for censorship to occur, and as history has shown, it certainly is not a good thing.     Censorship is unacceptable in all forms in a free country that promotes civil rights.  There is, however, one other element at play here: protection of youth and innocence.  Almost everyone can remember a time a child when they were young and innocent, free of worry and trouble.  That can disappear in a instant.  Children should not be exposed to things that are innappropriate for their age.  Nearly every movie nowadays has violent and risque, if not full-blown-adult, materials present in it.  The age of innocence is getting younger every generation, and children are becoming conditioned to this material to an extreme point.  A claim like this @MONTH1 sound hypotcritical coming from the mouth of one against censorship, but it is not 'censorship' when one is protecting the young.      Due to personal rights and what history has shown the world, censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children.  It is each person's choice of what they would like to read and absorb, so their choices should not be infringed upon.  The world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people.  Also, children should be protected, and that is not censorship.  Censorship solves no problems, but it makes everyone unhappy.  Therefore, why censor"	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
4029	2	"Do you think that books, movies, music, etc., should be moved if they are found offensive? I can't choose @CAPS3 they are both understandable. Therefore, I well dicuss how i feel about it in this essay and what I have experience on this topic.     Well lets get started! I could go both ways with this. But first I well just discuss the way I disagree with removing offensive things. Material that is instersting to many people mght not be instersting to me. I mean everyone should be able to listen and read things that the loved and enjoy. And I could really careless what other people loved to read and listen to. Someday, we all might come to enjoy things that we wouldn't every think we would. It's just that simply. I mean I love romance and scary books, and someone else might dislike them both. Noone can tell anyone what they should like or dislike.          I agree in away too! When people make a big deal out of somethings it kind of gets on your nerves, like when your mom is telling you make sure room is clean all the time! I agree with this @CAPS3 something maybe to offensive to someone and doesn't want their children. One time I was in a library looking at this book that really seemed good to read. But then some lady told me that I shouldn't read it @CAPS3 it to much for me. But it was just right for me. @CAPS2 went up to the main desk and started complaining. I was like, 'Are you serious?' I didn't want to be rude so I told her calmly, '@CAPS1 are you so worried about what I am reading?' @CAPS2 replied, ' @CAPS3, the book is to reviling.' I showed her what the book was called, '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6'. We ended the agruement. I still checked out the book, @CAPS3 I knew I would love it, and I do! They should just put things aside, that they think well be offensive and let people ask for the things. So people won't make a big deal out of it. Just keep the peace and give everyone what they want.          Well I'm done now. Hope you understand both sides of the agruement. Just remember that if you agree or disagree.Or you like me, who can't choice or understands both sides. It's your decision and noone can make you change what you love and enjoy to read or listen to. But I can't pick aside @CAPS3 either way their both a understandable."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4037	2	"Offensive much? Thats what multiple people feel towards curtain books. For instence if @CAPS5 was the bible and you were an athiest, or a person who doesn't believe in god, then the bible @MONTH1 be offensive and hurtfull to you. I feel as a student that there are so many people in the world that by the time everyone inserts their own feelings by taking away books then we would have nothing left to read. You see, everyone is different in their own way, so books, magazines and music wouldn't be around because everyone feels differently about different subjects. I feel that they are a resourse that is very helpfull, and multiple times knowledgeable on many grasping subjects.      First, besides books, we have magazines. If we would get rid of all of the magazines in the world then there would be a cut down on all those horrible advertisements that men long for. Second there would be less gossip. Most magazines are about @PERCENT1 gossip about the recent break-ups, and make-ups, of todays modern celebritys. I feel that the magazines are a waste of time because they hurt peoples feelings, also its offensive the way that some famous people act. I strongly believe we should take magazines off the shelves.     Lastly there is music. Some of the greatest inspiration comes from music. Don't you remember the song, 'We @CAPS1't @CAPS2 the @CAPS3?' @CAPS4 if you don't then i'll tell you a little about @CAPS5. @CAPS5's about america, things that have happened in the past and were a big deal. In the chorus @CAPS5 says, '-we @CAPS1't @CAPS2 the @CAPS3,- but we tried to fight @CAPS5. @CAPS5's always been burning since the worlds been turning.' @CAPS5's a song that is about americans saying that they @CAPS1't cause panic and such things, but that since the begining of time @CAPS5 already was. The song inspired many of the famous singers you @CAPS4 know. Elvis @CAPS6 is one of the many that you should know. We should keep music out so people, like me, who have been inspired, can inspire others. Music helps the blind, heals those who are sick, and give hope to americans. Without mucis there would be chaos.     Last and furthermore is movies, where would we be without movies? We need movies, not just for our intertainment, but some of the best movies are historical events. Events that help us get a better grasp and keen look at what has happened in the past. For instince the movie @CAPS7, and @LOCATION1, even the movie The @CAPS8 @CAPS9, they all help us picture events that have happened and are very enjoyable but also very educational. We should keep movies, there is no doubt in my mind.     In conclusion I hope I have created a clear message that you will take into consideration highly. We need books and music to inspire and electrify the world, and magazines we need not. We all need a little inspiration in our down spiraling lives, and we need education. Not the kind that we wish to see but the kind we need to see. I hope I have made a positive inpact on your thoughts, and feelings."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4038	2	"There are too many people in the world to just have one opinion about one topic and nothing else. If a person knows something is unjust, they obviously have to tell the world about it, or they feel like their opinion does not matter. Take, for example, women's clothing. If you show a man a piece of women's clothing on a computer screen, he will probably only have one or two opinions about that piece of clothing. If you show a woman that same piece of clothing, she will have more than two opinions about the piece of clothing. This is how society works today and it is not just because we were brought up that way; this is how we think and how we act.     @ORGANIZATION1 depicts beautiful as half dressed and makup put on like plaster. Many magazines and books, such as @CAPS1 and books about modeling, portray beautiful as stick thin and your clothes almost falling off your body. Many songs and movies tell you that being beautiful is on the outside. If you can find these magazines, books, and movies at your local bookstore, don't you think that they could possibly be two miles down the road at your local @CAPS2 library?      Libraries aren't just for adults and teenagers. They are intended for people of all ages. Many people do not realize this, but at many libraries, there are sections specified for teenagers. Young adult books and magazines should not even be put in the teenager section, only for the reason that there are subjects in many of the young adult books that a lot of teenagers have not even begun to dicuss yet. If these books and magazines are put in here for teenagers, do you not think a five year old child could wander up to the section, take out a magazine and wonder how the women in the advertisements grew up to be so beautiful? Like I said before, @ORGANIZATION1 depicts people to look beautiful, when it's all photo-shopped.      If a five year old child can get their hands on books and magazines that they shouldn't even know about, @CAPS3 would a library keep them on their shelves. The thoughts that the five year old child has now is '@CAPS3 am I not that beautiful?' @CAPS4 image is the key to how people view society today. Modeling agencies, photographers, and even cheerleading coaches make girls feel like they are worthless because they are 'too fat', 'too ugly', or 'too short' to be part of what they have wanted to be in their entire lives. Many women that @CAPS8 starve themselves every day just to maintain the 'healthy weight' which is @NUM1 pounds and you can see every rib in her body.      Many books, magazines, and television shows portray this as well. You can find them in libraries nation-wide. The magazine, @CAPS1, has articles about how to become skinny. The television show, @LOCATION1's @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8, shows people that being tall and as skinny as a stick is the way to go. Many workout books tell you that being like @PERSON1 is the 'best for your bod' way to be. You cannot tell a girl that she needs to be a specific height and a specific weight by a specific time. Woman don't work that way. No one does.      Many magazines, books, movies, and music tell you this, and it is not true. I believe that if libraries took these types of materials out of their facilities, then if would drop the rate of society's '@CAPS4 image' rapidly. Many woman and girls wouldn't feel like they are ugly or fat. They would love who they were and they would not believe what another person says about them or what they look like. Being beautiful is not just on the outside. Anyone can have a beautiful heart and that will shine through more than anything else."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4048	2	"The topic of library censoring has been increasing over the past few years. It has been discussed by many people, but a decision has never been reached. I say that there should be no library censoring. I would not have found my love for reading if libraries were censored like they are.     I think that there should be no censoring of libraries. It would impair our basic rights. Such as our right to freedom of expression. And our right freedom to the press.We would no longer live in a free country but a totalterrian state.     Though if they would put an age restriction on certian things that @MONTH1 please the debators. I think that many would agree to this if it was proposed . Thus, if we did this children would only be able to read or listen to materials apporiate for their age.     Though it is the parents who should censor what the children read and listen to not the libraries. It's the parents who introducee the children to music, magazines, and books. If the parents started to censor these materials early on this debate would not be going on as it is.     The topic of library censoring has been discussed and debated at increasing rates over that past years. Some want to censor our libraries though that is not the best choice. @PERSON1 said 'that if we have the right to censor libraries then thier will be no more books for any of us."	3	3		3	3	4	3																		
4051	2	"Libraries.     What things are found in libraries? Well libraries contain more then just books. They can have music, movies, magazines, books, and much more. All of the things are not for just one particular age. Libraries have things for people of all ages, even though some do not like many of the materials found in them.      The library in my town has certin place for chilrden, teens, adults, and for @CAPS1-rated thing. Not all people agree with what should be aloud in a public area. Libraries try to make everyone that comes find something that might be intersting to them. Even though some of the things they chose might be different then what the public expects.     When I go to the library I think I would mind is i saw some @CAPS1-rated thing. Even though I think everyone should have the freedom to read, watch, listen, and hear about what they want. I think making areas where children can't go is a good way of letting people get what they want to get and not exposing it to younger people. Haveing these areas would help parents and childern feel alot better about what they would hear or see at a library.     What can be done about this problem? Even though it @MONTH1 cost more or be to dificult for an ower of a library to do, I think that building rooms for different age groups would be an good thing to do. If smaller children see thing such as violace, durgs, and sex, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to do. Most parents try and keep there kids away for those parts of library but don't always sucide. So there for I think that building rooms for these area is the right thing to do.     Even though we all think different things should or shoulden't be seen in public, we can't stop them from being there. We could try to contain them to where only people that would like to see them do. It would just cost a little more money then some are willing to spend, but if you think of when you were a child would you of liked to see some of those things? If u ever have kids whould you like for them to see it? I would hope not. So try and make the better choic when u find unupropret things for unger viewers."	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
4052	2	"As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.'  I think we all can agree with @CAPS2. We have all read something that we did not necessarily want to finish or that we wish we had not read.  I, however, believe that these materials should not be taken off of the shelves and be put out of reach of our youth, or adults.  When you take away materials that some people use to learn, you take away their ability to learn.  Yes, they @MONTH1 choose another book and learn from it too but it should not be our choice to dictate what they can and can not read.Take for example the popular internet video clip, '@CAPS1 guys one hammer.'  @CAPS2 is a video of two guys beating a homeless man to death with a hammer and screwdriver.  I have never seen @CAPS2 movie and listening to my friends talk about it, I do not want to.  @CAPS2 seems like a gruesome and horrific video clip that would scar me for life, but it is a perfect example for @CAPS2 because what some do not want to learn from, others can.  I would never watch @CAPS2 or anything like @CAPS2 but my friends who have watched @CAPS2 have learned something. That is that you should be successful in life because if you are homeless then you could be beaten to death by some teenagers who are looking to have some 'fun.'  I kid you not, after hearing about @CAPS2 sad video it has inspired me to be a successful person and not become homeless. @CAPS2 brings us back to the main point - had someone said, 'No, @CAPS2 video can not be on the internet.' none of my friends would have seen @CAPS2 or told me about it.  Therefore I would not be driven to be a good student and a good person.  Then, when I was older I would have become homeless and would have had the chance to be the star in one of these videos. You can be sure that that is not something that I would want to be.In conclusion, I believe we should not interfere with some people's right to learn.  We should not take away materials that can be used to learn no matter how bad we think they are, because you never know, one man's pain is another man's learning tool. If we all took away the materials that we felt were innappropriate or needed censorship then we would have very few learning materials left.  As Katherine Paterson said, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'"	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
4058	2	"To who it @MONTH1 concern:     @CAPS1 you take away books because someone might find them offensive? Do you believe racism is a part of liturature? Libraries are considering removing books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from their inventory for censorship. They believe individuals might take offense to certain types of beliefs from the different variety of entertainment that they have in their library. These types of entertainment should not be aloud to be removed from public or private libraries.     In many libraries, their inventory is being stripped for censorship. This means that books, magazines, movies and music is being removed because some individuals might find it offensive. Individuals might disagree with certain beliefs concerning their lifestyle and what they believe.      Liturature can be described as art that an individual portrays it as in his/her own way. It has been in the world since man first learned to write to present day. This means it has been there wars, politics, art and slavery. All of these are a part of liturature, so liturature is history in it's own way.     Some say offensive material should be taken out of libraries. they might think that it should be removed from everywhere. It should not. It is a part of history. @CAPS1 you take away an era of history just because you find it offensive? I know I wouldn't. It tells us what was happening at that certain time. It tells us what was happening in that part of the world. It tells us what the opinions were of people at that time. Many people believe racism is wrong, but we shouldn't believe that no one thought it was right. Many people thought is was right. They might believe white skin is superior over dark skin, but we should respect their beliefs in return that they respect our's.     Liturature is important to society and how it works. Without it, we wouldnt be where we were today. Liturature should stay in the shelves of libraries where they belong. Personal opinions are a part of books, and we should respect that. @CAPS1 you want to be know for destroying an important part of history"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4060	2	"Should someones work catagorized as 'inappropiate' or 'offensive' be taken off of a shelf and not able to be sold or seen in stores? If you believe so, then do you think it is okay for the campaigners that run for @CAPS1 be able to express their thoughts and opinions on different topics? This is exactly what is being done when someone writes an article or a book that they have published to be distributed into stores or libraries.     When someone writes a book on something, they usually have a lot of interest in whatever topic they are discussing. Just as when @CAPS2 campaigners present themselves to the public and announce what party they will be running for and what their beliefs and disbeliefs are. If it is okay for someone to take a book off of a shelf, or even a magazine because people think the book is 'inappropiate' then maybe we should reconsider what the campaigners say on live @CAPS3.      Even if you were to walk into a store and there be nude magazines on the shelf, or cd's with lyrics that contain cuss words do you feel those should be taken off of shelves as well? There is a time and a place for where things like this should not be displayed. For example, when you go to a little kids store and things like this are being sat out for the kids to see, they will not forget what they saw or heard if referring to music. Kids have a great memory on things that should not be remembered. Like when they read a story and it includes someone robbing a bank, or a song that refers to drinking or doing some form of drug. When kids see or even hear things like this, they are more likely to try things that we would hope little kids would not try.     When someone spends months or even years on writing a story, they hope that they can get it published and be rewarded for their long, hard work. By doing this they try and get it to be published, and put in stores so people can buy it. Whether or not if your talking about music, movies, or books, its all the same. Things should be put out on display and people should be able to see all the different types of music and stories that are available.      If things were going to be taken off of shelves or not put out onto display, people will stop recording music, acting out movies, or even writing ad's and books. When and if this were to happen, people will not become educated with new available data. If there is nobody to write science books, or biography's then nobody will learn about new things. Same with music and movies, if people spend a few months or even a year writing a new album, or coming up with an idea for a movie and they work hard to get it done, they expect to get it out to the public. If its finally out and people have the chance to buy it, they hope it will stay available. If it doesn't and people think the movie is 'inappropiate' then the song writers and actors will more then likely not have the urge to do it all over again.     In conclusion, I think that if someone writes something or records something that has taken them a good amount of work and time that they should be rewarded and allowed to have their item sold. If someone belives that an item is 'inappropiate' then they should keep their comments to themselves, and not have the item taken off display. There are some people out there that enjoy things that are not 'appropiate' and they think its funny. Surely if the write or producer got a book or movie produced they thought it was good, and they believe that people will buy their product. So, if the writer thinks this, surely there is someone out there that feels the same. How are we to know if there is someone out there that agrees, and enjoys the book or movie if it has been taken off of the shelf because someone thought the material was 'inappropiate.'"	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
4061	2	"What if someone told you that you couldn't wear a yellow shirt because it was offensive? What if they said you couldn't look a certain way because you might offend somebody? Not just one person or group of people have the right to decide what is suitable and what is not. There are so many different religions and traditions throughout the @LOCATION2 it would be completely rediculous to set one standard for all people. If @CAPS1 aren't restricted when it comes to apperal, groceries, or automobiles, why should there be limits in the libraries? Libraries should not be censored because not only would censorship limit the resoursfulness of the libraries and smother the knowledge intake across the @LOCATION2, but it would also pose a threat to our future.      When one takes a trip to the library, one would expect to find a book, magazine, and/or movie on just about anything. It would be extremely frustrating to find that a library, which is supposed to contain content on nearly every subject, does not have what your looking for. Say a book on the asassination of @PERSON1 is what you fancy, so you ask the librarian where you could find it. You would be dissapointed if she says they don't carry assassination books because they are too vulgar for young children. This could become very troubling and would limit the library's resources.           Not only would censorship in libraries limit the content but it would also limit learning in the @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 are people supposed to stay informed if they are being sheilded from knowledge? Many people that do not have computers depend on the library. If they cannot get what they need at the library where would they go? The libraries would lose business and funding if they did not supply library-goers with the content which they desire. People would take their business elsewhere. Protests @MONTH1 break out and rebelious citizens @MONTH1 protest the censorship, causing an uproar in society.           The people would not be the only thing out of hand. The censorship would surely get out of hand, aswell. @CAPS1 are already being censored through news stations, radio, and tv shows. Libraries are a place where infinant knowledge is realistic and that is comforting for many @CAPS1. In libraries people choose what they learn: they aren't forced teachers or parents. The censorship @MONTH1 start out as a small intervention, but it could turn our nation upside down. Next thing we know, our desisions could be influenced by the books that only 'they' decide are suitable. What kind of society would we have then? Individuality would be lost and opinions would be forgotten.      Clearly, censorship in libraries is dangerous and unpredictable. If libraries were cencored, not only would  knowledge in the @LOCATION2 desinegrate, but libraries would lose their respect and threaten the future of @LOCATION1. No one tells me what to wear or say, so why should anyone tell me what to read? We are all entitled to our own opinions and beliefs. Our @CAPS4 @CAPS5 earned us our freedoms, we can not let censorship take them away"	6	5		6	4	4	4																		
4063	2	"Freedom of speech is a keen aspect in @LOCATION1 and thats what made our country flourish through many years. In the constitution it states that there is freedom of the press, which means that if something is written that might affend some people, then they have to deal with it. Some might say that some material is offensive, which sometimes it is. However I do not think that the books, magazines, etc. should be taken off the shelfs due to the feelings of another persons thoughts.     In @LOCATION1 over the years things have become more exceptable in media and books.  The rights have always been there but not fully practised. There have been book burnings, banned books, and even people being killed for there writings. For many years it went on until @LOCATION1 changed its way of thinking to a broader more open perepective. Though it still goes on I think that it is very closed minded. In some cases people blamed books that had nothing to do with killing someone, for the reason why they commited a murder.I do think there is a limit to how you distibute certain books and magazines. They shouldnt sell a book about death,poverty,or sex at a public school.      We all have diffrent things we like to read and write about. So why shoud we be taken away from because somone thinks its to offensive. I think not, if you dont like it then put it down and let someone pick it up who will read it. With my own experience i have seen bad people do what is expected of them , bad things. And they try to blame it on a book, story, or @CAPS1 show they had seen. Thats just a easy way out of a situation. I have read and saw very intense things in my life but does that make me want to do  bad things, no!      I know i cant speak for everyone when I say that books, magazines etc. or not harmful. But think about it like this wouldn't sometimes the person reading the stories figure they could learn and embrace from it rather then go out and do what the character did in the story? Reading opens up new things and is scientificly proven to make you smarter in the long run. The more you read the more awareness and knowledge you gain ,and just becuase you read a book about something doesn't mean you support it. It could maybe mean that you want to learn about it so you can understand it more."	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
4070	2	"Many books, movies, and magazines are made for the different age groups of adults and children.  I do agree that certain books are not approperiate for some children.  Is it right for some parents to ban books from schools and libraries?  Authors create books and stories because they like the idea, and students can wright what we want on paper because it's what we want it's called freedom.  Schools can try to be creative and have a way to only allow books to the approperate age groups.     Books are a great part of a students learning.  Parents need to learn, and understand no matter how much they don'@CAPS1 like it that they can'@CAPS1 protect their children from the world some day they will be moved out of the house supporting themselves.  How would childern and teens even know how to live or what and how to react to hearing a bad word or watching sexual on @CAPS1.V.  If students never know how will they live.       Books can be learning in many ways.  Some things a teenager might be experiencing a parent might not want to talk about with their child.  Maybe the family can'@CAPS1 afford to buy a pass to the public library. So the only other option is the school library books.  If students can'@CAPS1 have access to then whats the option for them?  Everyone knows how today's society is changing, if a student wants to learn about sex or @ORGANIZATION1's they should be able to if the age is approprite.     All libraries check out books so the book is under a name.  I know at our school students just come in and take the books instead of checking them out, but some students do still use the card and check the book out.  If schools had books that our for only a certain age group a soultion to getting the older students to check them out and only the right age could be the books are in a case that is locked up.  So for the student to have the book unlocked and checked they have an electronic key to unlock books for the age group they are in. When the student unlocks the book and goes to check it out the computer knows what books that specific student can get.  Books are very important to learning and all books need to stay and not get blocked by  parents."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4071	2	"Censorship in libraries? In my opinion I don't really care if books, movies, or magazines are censored. I'm not a person that does much reading but I do know of some books, magazines, and movies that are filled with perfanity. In my opinion that is just the authors way of how he or she wanted to do it.      I believe that libraries should keep these type of materials on the shelves but have them in sections maybe. Taking them off the shelves would be disrespectful to the authors/producers. That is their work and they took the time to do it for our entertainment! Maybe you really dislike all the cursing in books and magazines and want them gone...Well listen, there are heeps and heeps of books out there you can find that are not bad!      If you are more of the movie type of person but also do not like the cursing or nudity, there are plenty of movies out there that are very innocent! I hate when I sit down to watch a movie with the family and then all of sudden the actors start throwing around the @CAPS1 word and half naked women appear. But if we would simply read about the movie on the back of the case or ask about it then we would know to choose a different movie. One that is more family oriented and safe for children eyes.     So just because there are some materials that are out there with all sorts of fowl language and indecent human behaviors doesn't mean you should ban them from the libraries. If some people want to fill their mind with filth, let them. But for you who do not, get other stuff. Simply try telling other people about better books they can read and nicer movies to watch. Be a role modle and teach them about healthier viewings"	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
4078	2	"I do not believe that censorship in libraries is a good thing. For many reasons but to save sometime here are just a few of the reasons why I believe this, there would be no books left for anyone to read, if certain books where taken off the shelf we would not have the knowledge from them, and our kids would not know what other people can think of. At the end of this essay one might understand the advandages and disadvantages to censorship in libraries. @CAPS6 many books would be gone?     If we all took off one book that we found offensive then our children and other children would not be able to read. Taking off one offensive book per person leaves no books left in a library. What one person @MONTH1 find offensive another person could find rather enjoyable. Some of my friends think that '@CAPS1' is an offensive novel but I found the book to be rather enjoyable. On the other hand we also have to understand that there are somethings that just shouldn't be put out in public. @CAPS6 would we get as much knowledge as we have?     Without all the books that are in our libraries @CAPS6 would people get the knowledge to make great discoveries in science, history, and electronics? People would be lost if we didn't have our books. The books give people great knowledge and a great place to learn @CAPS6 to do things. I myself have learned @CAPS6 to become a successful @CAPS2 novel @CAPS3 from the @CAPS4 I took out of 'A @CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4 for @CAPS5.' @CAPS6 would the ideas of other people be heard around the world without books in our libraries?     Those books that are offensive can also be of great use when doing a research paper or just trying to find something to talk about with friends at school or work. Without the books that we have in the library people would not be able to understand what other people thought about certain ideas on politics and other issues in daily life. The books help people come up with ideas to create things and be createative in everything they do. The ideas that one person expresses in their writing is a great place to find a spark of imagination when a person needs something to keep their mind off of personal issues. Life without books?     Censorship is a good and bad thing in libraries, I myself on one hand do not find it appropraite but on the other hand it can be taken to a whole different perspective. People who want to use it don't understand that other people could take the books off the shelf that they, themselves like to read in their spare time, nor do they understand all the knowledge that we gain from books even if they are fiction, and lastly without the books that we have no one would know what someone in a different park of the world was thinking. Foremost people who want cenorship in libraries don't understand what would happen if we had the power to all take one book off the shelf. One could understand both sides of the coin here but we need to step back and think about what life would be like without our books."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4080	2	"Libraries have always been an outstanding source for information. Among the myriad of resourceful materials provided by libraries are book, movies, and magazines. Recently, the debate over whether libraries should censor offensive materials has caused quite a stir. Many parents argue that they don't want their children to be exposed to explicit materials, especially books, exhibited in public libraries. Others have retorted to this statement by saying that if every book that is viewed as offensive is taken off the shelves, the shelves would be nearly empty. Author Katherine Paterson stated,      ' All of us can think of  book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (Katherine Paterson). Books that are offensive should not be removed from libraries for the simple reason that they are still one of the most reliable sources for information and historical events, and, without books, society would suffer.     The most important reason as to why people shouldn't be allowed to remove offensive books from shelves is that if every person was allowed to remove a book that he/she found offensive, there wouldn't be many books remaining on the libraries' shelves. There are many historical works that contain offensive images and content, but people have to overlook this because these books are accounts of our history. Without them, society would forget about the past events that shaped and molded our world into the world it is today.      Another  important reason why library censhorship is wrong is that material that one person @MONTH1 find to be offensive @MONTH1 not be ofensive to another. Every person has his/her own view on certain matters and events. For this reason, the censorship of a certain book shouldn't come down to the opinion of one individual. Rather, the decision to take a certain book off of library shelves should come from the opinions of a large group of individuals. By doing so, a fair representation of      @CAPS1, most books are meant to tell either fictional stories  or historical events that aren't meant to offend anyone. Fictional books are meant to fill the mind of whoever reads them with tales and mental images of a story created by the author. Also, historical books are meant to capture the events of our past so that people @MONTH1 be able to look back on these events both now and in the future.        In all, the idea of censoring libraries is a negative proposal. Books were meant to provide historical accounts and fictional stories to enrigh the minds of readers, not poison them with bad content. Everyone has their own views, which is why people should learn to respect the views of different books no matter how offensive the material @MONTH1 be to them"	4	3		4	4	4	4																		
4083	2	"Have you ever wanted something removed from the shelves of a library because you thought it was offensive? If so, how did you go about the situation and what did you want done about it? I know in my experiences I have found some things that were offensive, so I am sure that they are out there. I think there are so many rules, qualifications, or standards that can give someone reason to take something off a shelf, and those can be different for everyone.      If you were in a children's library or a school library, I am sure most people would agree that any book with offensive language, situations, opinions, etc. should be removed from the shelves. Now if you were in a public library in the teenage or adult section and those same books that were inappropriate for the children's library are in the teenage or adult section, that might be admissable. The audience is different; therefore, the types of literature, music, movies, etc. can be more opinionated, mature, and controversial. Part of why something should come off of a shelf depends on who is going to be reading it or listening to it.     In my opinion, there is a fine line as to what can be considered too controversial or too mature. @CAPS1 is one reason why I think there should be censorship because some things are definitely too controversial or mature. Although, I also think there should be guidelines, and perhaps rules, on what should be allowed on shelves and what should not because some things might be on the edge of the line, but depending on what it is it can be, for example, a learning tool or great read.     As Katherine Paterson said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' @CAPS1 is why I think there should be guidelines or rules. If everyone had the right to remove something from a shelf, there might not be anything left to read or listen to. Different things are offensive to different people. If there were rules or guidelines, that would ensure there would still be things to read and listen to in the future.     I think there should be censorship in libraries. Some pieces of work are just too offensive, and they need to be taken off the shelves. I think it would be appropriate for some rules to be developed or some guidelines to be created. As Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.'"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4096	2	"What is @CAPS1, @CAPS1 is whay made this country the who we are today! There are manny ways people can exspress them self in todays world, and it just so happens the art of writing acting and art are a huge part to the way people exspress them self. Because all of us are different and have our different veiws on the subjuct. Im not going to preach to you about what is right and what is wrong. im just going to share a few prior exspereances. Now all of theas were from being in a libraries. Some of them in smaller towns, others in the hart of a larger city. There is evean a story of a man and wife, in the suburbs of a larger city. It is also amazing to see what is exsepted in differeant parts of our country.      Well it all started when I was sitting at a small table in the back of the @LOCATION1 librarie. It was a small groupe of friends and we were all working on our reaserch papers. But we then saw a man and a woman, what I proseaved as husband and wife. They were looking at the magazines on the shelf directly infront of us. As he picked up a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazin she looked over to him and proclamed, that is so derogitory against woman. So he put it down and walked out. Wandering what was so bad about this magazin I walked over to the rack to see a woman standing in her underware with a classic car. About a mounth later I was walking in my local librare droping off some books for my mom. Instantly when opening the door I hear to people having a heated conversation about the painting they had hanging on the back wall, in the adult section. Wich was of a woman with her chest exsposed, now mind you this was not a modern painting it was rather old, with the paint slowly  pealing off. Now that painting was there for manny years with out any one saying any thing and that was the argument made by the head librarean. There were manny people standing in the area that this was taking place, and manny of them were not evean willing to hear what the woman had to say, because the painting turned out to be very famous and has been there since before some of the middle aged people in there could reamber.      As you can see there are manny differant veiws on what is exsepted in the modern time. Advertizement is all over and manny magazines use peoples bodys to draw people to their add, so they can try to sell their product. I belive there should be a line drawn when it comes to that kind of addvertzing. They @MONTH1 have to come to a agreement that each magazine should say if it contains the kind of adult content like that. if they were to make this a law they should have to put it right in the front cover so you know if you pic that magazine up, you are at risk of seeing things like that. altho when it comes to a painting of times before the @DATE1 and people had grown up in that same area for years and have been seeing this painting since they were yong too, I do not think that painting should have been taken off the wall. There is a fine line when it comes to the information being exseptible or not that is why I do belive there should be some kind of rating system whith the book and etc"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4097	2	"@PERSON1 is saying we shall all share then never giving @CAPS4 back. Also we can't all get what we want at the sametime or at all. If that book is popular then they should of bought more to sell for the other people that doesn't have the book and would like to have @CAPS4.      Of course sharing is better then wasting your money on something when someone has the book that you know and would let you barrow @CAPS4. And yes, We all know that most people these days don't usually share.      To tell you the truth you don't always get what you want. Either get over @CAPS4.      Yea @PERSON2 has a @CAPS1 but to tell you the truth everybody has there own opinion.     We all don't have to listen to what other's say but if you agree with that person then you agree.      Like I said everybody has there own opinion and I stated mine.Pretty much like '@CAPS1 OF @CAPS2.'      No, I do not believe that books,music, and etc. should be taken off the shelves because @CAPS3 @CAPS4's stupid you'll lose your job and @CAPS5 people out there in the world need something to do @CAPS6!?     I don't read I mostly listen to music because I think music to me is more interesting and entertaning then reading a book. I mean yea I read articles from magazines but like I said mostly listen to music.     Reading a book is mostly like someone telling you a story about so and so or somthing . So to me @CAPS7 book is in infront of @CAPS7 face @NUM1. '@CAPS7 life'     @CAPS8 later on in @CAPS7 life I will be interested in reading a book but now I'm enjoying @CAPS7 life being a teenager.     So basically I'm telling you @CAPS7 own opinion and I think @CAPS4's completely stupid for being graded for this because everybody has there own opinion just saying.     You could either agree or disagree but for this @CAPS4's mostly a disagree"	2	2		2	3	2	3																		
4101	2	"Throughout history there have been many books written at a time in history when their beliefs on certain things differed from what our world today believes. Things that have changed as our world has changed are the views on slavery, womens rights, religion, and many other things. These views are based on what most people of a time frame believed. I feel that just because something someone wrote or said offends someone, does not give people the right to ban that book or quote from society as a whole. They have the right to ban it from themselves, but it is up to each individual whether or not it is banned for everyone.      Our government gives us the right to have freedom of speech. This shows that even though someone @MONTH1 write or speak out against the majority opinion, they can say whatever they want without being punished for it. This means that people can not just ban something for what it might say or portray. In my life explicit music seems to be something that some people are trying to ban. My parents believe that I am at the right age that I should be allowed to listen to whatever type of music I want to.      I feel that public libraries can set age restrictions on items based off language, nudity, and other inappropriate things for children just as movie theaters do, but they do not have the right to ban books. Even though there is an age restriction, as long as the guardian of the child direct says it is fine if his/her child @MONTH1 check out the book or the parent checks out the book for the child, then it is fine that that child gets that book. The choice for what is appropriate for that each child should be left up to their parents.      If libraries had to ban books because someone said that a certain book or magazine was offensive, then a library would have very few to no books. In almost all of books someone @MONTH1 be able to find something offensive to them or to someone else. These books that offend people should be kept on the shelf so that people can understand how society's views on things were back in the time period that the book was written. These items in libraries that are found offensive shows us what was wrong with society at that time and helps us learn from past mistakes in history and how to avoid them. For example, in the play A @ORGANIZATION1 it shows how the society's view of women was. It showed that they did not think highly of women and how there purpose in life were to raise the children and that was it. They did not feel that they had the intellect to talk about science or anything like that. This indirectly teaches us how we should not treat women today.       If libraries start to ban books, music, movies, magazines or other items then they are hiding things they do not want people to read. Libraries should not be able to ban something because it is offensive, but they have the right to put age restrictions on certain things. Authors and artists have freedom of speech to say whatever they want and libraries can not take that away from them"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4106	2	"Read, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 ?     Books, music, and movies all have a meaning and a purpose to them. In our spare time, we all enjoy to read, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 the things that let us do so. These things keeps us all occupied when theres alot of time to spare. The library is a place where you can go read in peace and @CAPS1 to music with no distractions or anything, but there are somethings that are not cut out for the library.          People find books at the library that they find very interesting and decides to check them out, but little do they know what the book and/or magazine has in it. Books come in all different genres and so do music and movies. And we all have our own views in what type of genre we enjoy listening, reading or watching.           Genre comes in all kind of different types. For example, theres only one certain type of book for a child and which at the library should be picked out for a child to read and a child only. Theres also books for grown adults and adults only and once checked out, it should be kept from a childs hand or vision. Because children could see the wrong things and things might get out of hand.     All readings, music, or movies that have explicit or uncensored graphics or words should personally have their own section in the library. In this case, nothing bad could happen and everything is in place with everything else. Honestly all media actually should have their own section. For example, all kids media should be in one section and all adult media should be in another section.          All books should be left on the shelves of every library, only because one knows what should be read and what shouldn't be read. A kids desired book is a childrens book with color and picture while on the other hand, an adult has their own type of selection. So books should stay where they belong and not tooken down from any self, that also goes for, movies, music, or any other media"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4112	2	I think that it is should be left alone the way it is because it put that way for a reason. They might not know the reason so thats why i think it should because the person might get mad if you mess it up just cause you dont like it the way it is because it is offensive to some people. Other reasons is because people are gonna home and watch it online or on tv so how is it gonna make a difference. It is not goiing to make one difference at all.	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
4119	2	"I feel that books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves. Just because some one @MONTH1 finds them offensive. They only become offensive when people think they are.     I feel this way because no one is forcing any ony to watch or read any thing they dont want to. No one is telling sudents what they can and can't watch or read. Every one has the choice. To choose what they want to read or watch.      what one person @MONTH1 find offensive and wrang. Another person. @MONTH1 find interesting and exiting. I have felt the same way before, but that still gives me no resone to take it off the shelf. The next person after me. Has as much the same right as I did. The person has the right to watch or read what I have. To like or hate what ever is on the shelves.     There are lots of things in a @CAPS5. Other than things that people @MONTH1 find offensive. There are scary books like '@CAPS1 @CAPS2.' @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2 best selling auther, @PERSON2. There are mistury books like 'The @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS3 another @ORGANIZATION2 best selling auther, @PERSON1.     So to some up my esay. Nothing sould be taken off @CAPS5 shelves.

4130	2	"I believe that if something or someone offends you, you have the right to take a stand. You shouldn't have to deal with it. If something is offensive in your library, it has no right to be there. A library is supposed to be a helpfull place. Who would want to sit back and watch a raciest movie? Who would want to have a little kid watching something sexual in a movie? Magazines can even develope a lot of problems. Muisc can be straight offensive.      If a young adult or a child reads or watches a movie that is raciest, it teaches them bad things. Racism is a very hurtful thing. What you see or read can really have an affect on you. You @MONTH1 not realise that it is wrong. It could have you saying hurtful things to a differant race. If a person isn't raciest and they see something that is, it could offend them. They @MONTH1 feel like they 'cool'. They go out and say raciest things. It makes them feel good. Later on they feel guilty. All because of a movie or book. If a movie is making fun of your race, it hurts. Being made fun of hurts. It is technicly bullying. Bullying can lead to suicide. Who cares if someone is black or white? We are all the same deep down inside. Movies like this should be banned from public libraries.      Movies today can have pretty much anything they want in them. Sex, drugs, cursing, etc. Kids can get by with watching them without anyone saying anything. The librarian just swipes your card, then you have the movie.They @MONTH1 not know right from wrong. If they see someone doing drugs or having sex, they might think that it is cool. They @MONTH1 go out and do it. We do not need movies like this in our public library. We should make it a lot harder for kids to try to get movies like this. These moives can also offend us. Make us feel uncool. Make us feel like we have to go out and try it.      In magizines today, they make everyone look so perfect. These people can offend you. Young teenage girls or even boys are the ones mostly looking at magizines. If you see @PERSON1 in a magizine, you begin to want to look like her. You see how skinny she is. She is tan. She has perfect skin. Its normal for someone to be jeleous. We are only human. Sometimes these images get to us. We @MONTH1 starve ourselves to try to be skinny. That can be very dangerous to your health. These girls knock our confidence down. Into today's society, people stive for popularity. They want to look perfect. They want all the guys to stair. We use the girls in the magizine to helps us know what we want to look like. You should love who you are and what you look like. You are unique. No one has to be skinny to be pretty. Magizines can be offensive.      In today's society music is horrible. Rap, country, or rock music. Some of the lyrics can really offend people. The words get in your head everytime you hear the song. If you really take the time to look up lyrics to a song, you will realise that they will let you say anything. I can't name how many songs I know, just beeing a teenager, that make fun of something. For example, there is a song by the band @ORGANIZATION1. It is called 'I must be emo'. It makes fun of people who are unique in their own way. Some lines from the song are, '@CAPS1 I get depressed, I cut my wrists in every direction'. How can you make fun of someone who does self harm. Depression and self harm are a big thing in today's society. Their is nothing funny about it. If someone who hurts themselves hears this, think of what could happen. It would really offend them! They could go and cut theirselves even more. They could try suicide. In the song it also makes fun of gay people. It makes fun of the way 'emo' people look. 'I look like I am dead and dress like a homo', is another line from the song. I don't know about you but to me that would be terribly offensive! We need to get these types of songs out of our libraries.      We should have a say to what is in our public library. The library is ment to be a good place. Anyone can go their. We are all unique in our own ways. If something is offensive to you, you have the right to stand up for yourself. We need to make offensive books, movies, magazines, etc., harder to get a hold of."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4140	2	"I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines and other thing can be removed from the shelf.

I'm a @CAPS2. I'm always trying to do the right thing. And everyday my parents have chores for me to do around the house and I believe that those should be done first insted of doing other things. And I think it's crazy to remove books and other things from a shelf unless a shelf a full of books and other things. And its something that would have to be done.      Removing anything from the shelf is not bad. But it is not something that had to be done all the time. It is something that some people might do. It is not my thing.  I'm always trying to be obedient and have good behavior around others"	2	2		2	4	3	4																		
4141	2	"Should a library be able to remove a book or a movie from its shelves if someone happens to find it offensive? I believe that the answer to that question should be no, because everyone in the world could find something in a library that could be considered obscene or offensice. However, if a library decides to remove every  piece of literature or art in its possession that someone finds offensive, the walls and shelves of its core would be bare.          I'm sure you have seen and heard many people who have been offended by silly things such as children's novels, pictures in magazines, and song lyrics. I know I have seen people who have become livid because of how offeneded a piece of literature or art has made them. But with seeing such reactions, I've come to the conclusion that what someone @MONTH1 find offensive, another person could find beautiful. For example, paintings of nude men and women are looked at as wrong and disturbing by some and are also seen as masterpieces by others. Everyone has their own opinions about things but it's not the library's job to worry about which opinions are wrong or right.           There is really no way to avoid offending someone without completely clearing the walls and shelves of a library. Simply anything could be seen as offensive to anyone. I know that I've personally found some books on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to be disturbing because of how graffic they are. However, that doesn't mean other people shouldn't be able to read something a young woman found offensive. Offensive pieces of literature and art are often the best kinds because they evoke emotions in people, although maybe not the intened emotions, and make people think. You learn a lot when you're looking at something that has put strong emotions into you.       With everthing going on in our society and culure today, in the @LOCATION1 and around the world, someone is bound to be offened everyday by something. Religious groups @MONTH1 be offened by the way a cover of a book is drawn or the pictures in a teen magazine and politcal leaders @MONTH1 be offended by what journalists are writing about them. You see, there is simply no way to avoid offending people. To me, it's truly surprising that libraries are still worrying about censorship when television shows are showing sex, drugs, and violence. People are obviously getting offened by what television shows are airing but, see, that's just it. The television shows are still being aired. Offensive or not, people are still watching, just as people are still reading books, looking at pictures, listening to music, that someone, at some point, has found offenseive.      If a library decides to take out every offensive piece of literature and art what would be left? My friends, the answer is nothing. A beautiful creation to you @MONTH1 bring back horrific memories to someone else but that doesn't make it a bad creation. A novel that makes your stomach turn in knots @MONTH1 teach you more than you've ever learned before in your whole entire life. I hope people realize that just because something is offensive to someone doesn't make it wrong. Just because someone decided that they thought a piece of literature or art was not what they wanted to see or read doesn't give them the right to deprive someone else of the chance to read or see it.  As you can clearly see, libraries shouldn't waste their time on censorship, because no matter how hard you try, someone will find something that bothers them."	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
4150	2	"When walking into the library and children are finding books, movies and magazines they should not look at. It can be offensive. I believe that it is not the authors fault for the offensive language in their work. I can understand that parents can get upset if their child is reading a book they should not be looking at.     My opinion is that students should be able to choose what they want to read and if it is offensive to them they should stop reading the book. I feel that the student or adult should know if it is harmful to the student or not. Censorship in the library is to find books for everyone to read.     I think that they should not ban anything in the library because it can be used for something useful to the person. I find it hard to believe that libraries will remove every offensive book, movie, or music from shelves because the rating of the item can be horrible.     I just don't think it should be a good idea for them to ban things from libraries if they need to use the information from the book. If it offends them then they should not read the book, and choose another book. Authors work too hard for writing their book and go through the publishing process.      My opinion is a no because I feel they should not remove items off shelves of the libraries because the content of the item is not appropriete to someone. My views can vary when I am older and have children of my own someday. But as of right now I do not think they should remove items off shelves at libraries"	3	3		3	4	4	4

I read world war @CAPS1 books, and a wide selectionof others and if they take those away just for being offensive id have nothing to read. If i find a book i think is offinsive I just put it back and dont get it.     I think they should age books like this book is for ages @NUM1, and especialy movies and magizines because kids dont need to read or see certain things, because books and movies sometimes refer to drugs or alcohole and murder. I dont think music is a big deal because music isnt very influincial but music videos are soometimes bad. Movies sometimes go to far though and i wouldnt want my kids watching them, so i wouldnt mind if they take thos off the shelves if they are offinsive.I dont think books should be taken off the shelf because parents should know what there kids are reading anyway. I would at least check the book or magazine before geting it for my kids and so should other parents.theres always going to be offinsive books and movies so its the parents job to make sure there kids dont get thos kinds of books or magazines."	3	3		3	2	2	2																		
4161	2	"Offensive material shouldn't be taken off the shelves at all. Books are written on various of topics from love to sci-fi. Everyone is offended by something; if all of us could remove a book that we precieve as offensive then the human race wouldn't read anymore.     @PERSON1 had to demonstrate this in a similar aspect to congress concerning his music lyrics. @PERSON1 is the reason why there is an '@CAPS1' sticker on @CAPS2's that contain offensive lyrics. Books SHOULD @CAPS3 be censored at all. It hides the authors thoughts, idea, and meanings behind their writing.     I've read hundreds of books from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1. The aspect that a parent is worried about what their children might read implies parents need to step in. Having an one-on-one talk about the books context with their child could solve this uneasiness parents have about books.     Pre-@CAPS4 to @CAPS5 to @CAPS6 requires many stages of growing physically and menatally. Through those phases kids learn from various sources including negative ones. It's up to the parents to ensure that tomorrow's generation can depict what is truthful and what is false.     My grandmother shared a memory about when I was @LOCATION1 learning to read. I was reading out of a @CAPS7 magazine; yes the magazine is intended for adults but I obtained the skill to read from it. A skill that will propell me into job oppertunities and assist me in everyday life."	3	4		3	3	4	3																		
4162	2	"Throughout the years, many events have taken place in our history. Throughout these times the events have been recorded, journaled, and filmed. These thoughts, opinions, and facts @MONTH1 be offensive to a select few in our @CAPS2. The question is, 'Should our libraries take these 'offensive' pieces off the shelves?' The simple answer to this highly disputed question is no. Censoring our libraries would be a harmful and wrong thing to do to the general public.      Censoring our libraries creates an illusion of a perfect @CAPS2. If libraries were filled with tasteless articles and perfect fairyland books the library would become a place where reality is not present. Libraries hold information that is raw and true without leaving the facts behind. People need to get a taste of reality in order to survive in the 'real @CAPS2' and one of the greatest ways to abtain this knowledge is through books. Being exposed to offensive material and different viewpoints helps shape ourselves into who we are or will become. To take this away would be harming our development and growth, thus creating an 'imperfect' @CAPS2.      Certain points in history are not something that everyone can be proud of. The @CAPS1, @LOCATION1's genocide, and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 are all devastating points in time that can be a touchy subject to one and few people. However, history is an important factor in everyones lives; we know history in order to not repeat it. Losing this information is way for people to not be clearly informed, harming the future outcome of our society. Without public records of these happenings, it can cause confusion and misconcepted views of important topics. If we censor all the media from libraries across the nation, ordinary people, such as yourself, would be 'living in the dark.'     As people develop their own opinions and views overtime they begin to distinguish the difference between right and wrong. Your rights @MONTH1 be someone else's wrongs. What @MONTH1 be offensive to you, @MONTH1 not be offensive to the person sitting next to you. Quoted by the author Katherine Paterson, '...if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In truth, by removing offensive material from our bookshelves there would be no media left. Not everyone will have the same opinion on matters that hold importance, but that is why the @CAPS2 goes around. We as a society have the right to guard our ability to share opinions, censorship destroys our ability to do so.      Everyone is different. The @CAPS2 is full of diversity and viewpoints that are bursting with interesting concepts. By censoring records of history, opinion, observations, our @CAPS2 becomes an illusion. We need to have these facts available to the general public. By ridding ourselves of 'offensive' media we cannot share our opinions with one another for a more successful @CAPS2. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because it is harmul to our growth as a society and is overall the wrong thing to do"	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
4179	2	"In my opinion, I do believe we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves. These materials @MONTH1 not be offensive to some people, but it can be to others. They can be against some peoples religion and way of life.     I have read some books outside of my school library that I think should not be found on a library shelf. Now they are putting those same books in libraries. These books have violence and inappropriate behavior in them. Are these books you want your children to be reading?      There are even movies that are like those books. Many shows are based of a book series, and that series @MONTH1 not be a good one. The series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers. The kids could see something they think is really neat on the @CAPS1 and then go out and try that. They do not understand that what they do @MONTH1 not be a good thing. They could get into a lot more trouble then they want to get in.     I know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all. In my opinion, the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them. After that, the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch them.     There are some that would agree with my opinion and some that would not. What do you think? Do you want your children watching or reading something bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way? Would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good? Or do you want them to know what they should and should not do?"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4181	2	"Yes i believe that certain materials such as book's, music, movie's, magazines, etc should be removed off of the shelves at a library if they are offensive in any way. Librarian's shouldnt have bad stuff on the shelves at libraries if it is offensive to some people. Libraries should only have interesting books with good story's to read and kid books. There should be no sexual or racial book's, movies, magazines, etc.     Those thing's that are found offensive should be taken off the shelf because there are little kids that go to the library and they should'nt be able to see those thing's or check them out. I do agree that library's should have a wide range of different kind of book's, and movies, etc because everybody has there own taste in what they like. But the thing's that are offensive should'nt be on the shelve's.     If library's didnt have offensive thing's on the shelf then nobody would have to see them or have arguments about them. It would be so much easier because it would'nt cause any problems with people because they would'nt be on the shelf. So if they would just take those thing's off the shelf then nobody would see them and there would be no problem's at the libraries. Adults and kids could go to the library and pick out what they wanted without seeing the offensive thing's on the shelves which would make it a much better place to enjoy."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4183	2	"Should offensive material be censored?     Removing things such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect., that are found offensive could be both good and bad. It could be good because younger children wouldn't be exposed to things that are considered offensive. Although, it could be bad because it takes away from freedom of choice. Most young children don't know good from bad, so censoring these things for them could be good. Though, you shouldn't want to shelter your children from the real world. Protecting your children from things that offend you, @MONTH1 stop them from growing up badly. Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there.     Censoring or removing things that you find offensive @MONTH1 be a good idea. There are plenty of reasons someone @MONTH1 want to do this. A parent @MONTH1 not want their child to read, hear, or see something simply because it offends them. Another reason parents @MONTH1 want to censor these things is just because they don't want their child exposed to it. Parents know that most young children don't know right from wrong, so they'd like to make that choice for them. By doing this, a parent knows what their child is reading, hearing, or seeing. Some parents @MONTH1 feel that they need to protect their children from these things because it could be harmful to them. They also @MONTH1 feel this should be done so their child doesn't grow up badly.     Removing offensive material from shelves would take away from a person's freemdom of choice. Who wants to be told what they can and cannot read? If a parent does this to their child, it just sheltering them from the world around them. A child should be able to know the life around them before they grow up and are completely lost. Parents @MONTH1 think that this is good idea because it protects their children from things that @MONTH1 be considered bad. When really, protecting them could be harmful. Censoring books, movies, music, ect., won't stop what is already bought and out in our world. Offensive music, movies, books, ect., have already been bought and sold for years.     I feel that censoring or removing books, music, movies, magazines, ect., should not be done. It doesn't give people a choice. Some people @MONTH1 like reading graphic novels or things like that. Music is made for the enjoyment of the people. Some people like their music to talk about drugs or curse, why take that away from them? It just wouldn't be fair to take a choice away from someone. A movie is just a movie, it's not real. Just because something is done in a movie doesn't mean that a person will go off and do it. I think people should be able to have a choice.     Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there. If people stopped to think about it, they would realize that offensive material has already been bought by others. Plenty of people have illegaly downloaded, or bought music that uses inapropriate language. This music is already in their iPods, @NUM1's, and burned onto @CAPS1, there's no removing it. Books that some @MONTH1 find offensive have already been printed and sold to others. One person @MONTH1 lend that book to another, therefore the offensive book is being spread around. Plenty of movies that involve adult content, violence, and drugs have been released into the media. Lots of people own these kinds of movies. So, why censor things now, when there's already unremovable offensive material out?"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4191	2	I think all books and other stuff should stay on the shelfs. Because other people should have the right to learn about something if you have already learned it.  Censorship is kind of out of the way.  I think it really doesnt matter if they see it now or later because they are still going to see it and learn about it later on in life. If someone wants to read it I think they have right to because it is their own choice.  I have been observing students and adults in the libaries and every where they think they can run everything.  But this is what I think is right	2	2		2	3	2	3																		
4193	2	"Do I think certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines that might be offensive should be taken off the shelves in libraries? Of course not, there supprisingly still is such a thing called freedom of speech in this country. Just because some people @MONTH1 find something offensive does not mean that the so called offensive material does not have the right to be published or shared with anybody.     Think of some authors that wrote books like @PERSON1, although there were alot of racist remarks in literature of that time period. That does not mean that they still are not a part of american history. What would taking these types of books off the shelves accomplish? Absoulutely nothing is what, racist people arent going to go hey since all these racist books are gone im just going to except everyone now.     Music and movies are forms of expression aswell, and if someone wants to get out of hand write something offensive so be it. You do not have to listen the songs or watch these movies. Nobody can force you to do anything of that nature.     People just take everything so literally these days, they got to have their part in anything and everything. When they should reallize that most problems like these do not even pertain to them at all. That they should just focus on their lives and not worry about everything they hear in the news."	3	3		3	2	3	2																		
4197	2	"Opinion      I don't think they should be removed because in books tell you what it is about in the back. Movies tell you what it is rated. It is mom's or dad's fault. They are the one how allow us to read it, watch it, listen to it, or even play it. if they don't want us learn it then they should't even get for us and the reason they get it for us is because kids are spollied. they want every little thing in the world and the parants are buying it for them to make them happy.     The parants are not the only ones to blame. The kids are to blame to. They are the ones how want to go the rated @CAPS1 movies or get a rated @CAPS2 video games that have offensive language. kids also say offensive language to each other and suspect them to know what it means. The kids that heard the bad word will go to there parants and say 'what those that word mean'. It happen to me and I said those words to my parants.     When I fist read, heard, and watched it and told my parants what it means I got hit for saying that word. I thought to my self that they want to hear that from me. I was mad that i ever said that word I wished I can go back in time and never say that to my parants that. I don't know why I kept on saying it over and over. i just couldn't get it out of my head. I got in trouble by saying it just because I heard that stupid word that i wished never heard.       I heard it so many times I couldn't get out of my head it is like they knew what it ment but I knew they didn't know because they just said it randomly and I was preaty sure they didn't tell there parants because the one how told there parants got hit still woundering what it ment still having the red mark in there face thinking what they did wrong to deserve it. when I found out what it ment i never said it for a long time till someone got me so mad i started to say it again.     Now the two opinions still stands how should we blame the parants or the kids, should we take down the stuff that is offensive to us so the kids will learn the bad words? The choose is yours not mine beacuse it was mine i would blame the kids and no we shouldn't take it down stuff that has offensive language because for a lot of us we don't find it offensive to us or others. Just consider this 'what you decide people will be against it no matter what'"	3	3		3	2	2	2																		
4203	2	"Have you ever felt that books are offensive? Maybe, but @CAPS2 all depends on who you are and @CAPS1 angers you. Somepeople think that books, music, movies, and etc. can be offensive in some way. I know they can, but @CAPS2 can only effect an amount of people if they together understand the problem. I think there are several ways why and why not to take books out of our libraries.     From @CAPS1 I hear, people do go angry over things but the question is '@CAPS1 gets them so angry?' @CAPS2 is different for somepeople than others. For example, a @ORGANIZATION1 fan reads a book about them and the author makes fun of them or teases them. That is a way to make someone offended and angry at a book. others can get mad at a movie because @CAPS2 discriminates races of other kinds. Like how in the @NUM1's, some movies characterized @CAPS3 @CAPS4 as stubborn, ignorant, human beings. In my view, actually being @CAPS3 @CAPS6 myself, sort of aggrivates me too, but none the less, shouldnt argue because of one major amendment, freedom of speech.     @CAPS2 depends on how @CAPS2 angers them also, like how back in world war @NUM2, the @CAPS7 people were characterized as short, fat people with big noses taking all the money away from the @CAPS8. That can be offensive, and is used usually to talk people over to their side. I think that if something offends you lightly, most of the time you shouldnt worry about @CAPS2, but if you get offended very heavily and none of the stuff they say about that topic is true, maybe you should get someone else to read @CAPS2 with the same dislikes and likes as you. That could help determine if @CAPS2 is truly offrnsive to people in general, not just you.      Then after that the main question we would ask would be '@CAPS1 should we do next?' If I were someone and the book I'm reading offends me massively, I would contact the library @CAPS2 came from and ask them to read @CAPS2, and if they think @CAPS2 is offensive, then they would more than likely take @CAPS2 off the shelfs. Now just because of someone that likes a sports team reads a book about them and the book talks trash about the team, dont tell the library, thats just a waste of time. Just simply pick up another book and read @CAPS2. I can understand how people will get mad over racism and disrimination, but not over a sports team.     So I hope that people can someday understand the limit to were something can actually be offending. Or maybe its just in our common nature for us to be offended when something we like gets made fun of. That is why I think that books should only be taken off shelfs for only very good reasons, not silly one"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4206	2	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1,      I believe that the country should take off all the books, movies, magazines, and music that has any kind of offensive cover, or any offensive mind grabbing, sexal contact in any of the  story, music, etc. Children don't need to be seeing that stuff just sitten around, the radio for example, the music that they put on like rap, hip-hop with all the cusin and singing about mony, cars, girls, and sex. Kids don't need to be hearing that stuff on the radio, and adalt books that are sitten around in @ORGANIZATION1 ready to be read by adalts, not children.The children need to know about all the sexual conflict some day just not when there @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old looking at pornograghic magazines, and movies. So I hope you keep this in mind get that stuff off the streets and not into childrens hands."	3	2		3	2	2	2																		
4222	2	"Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I disagree with Katherine Paterson's statement because there is a @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 and the @CAPS1 to Write. The author obviously had a purpose to write the novel, compose the music, or to deliver the movie. There will always be items that will be offensive to some people, but to others there is a meaning behind it.     The @CAPS1 of @CAPS5 gives everyone the right to speak what is on their mind. That @CAPS1 allows them to publish whatever they have to say in a novel, a piece of music, or in a movie. Sure there @MONTH1 be some parts that @MONTH1 be inappropriate somewhere in a novel, piece of music, or a movie, but that doesn't mean the whole item will be inappropriate. Some people might think some things can be offensive while others don't at all. There maybe somethings out there in this world that you @MONTH1 think are offensive, but have you stood up and told that company yourself?      Being able to put down anything on paper that you want everyone to know about is the @CAPS1 to write. With that you can't be told not to do so. For example, the '@CAPS6' magazine maybe offensive to an abundent number of parents who don't want their kids to look at it, but that magazine isn't intended for children to look at. That magazine's purpose is to show adults what is all out there to buy to make their appearance sexy. It's not to be offensive to anyone and that company has the @CAPS1 of write to publish such a thing. The @CAPS1 to write serves its own purpose to all of the writers, composers, directors, and anyone who wants to write in a journal or to write a note.      I bet there has been a novel, a piece of music, or a movie that you just love. Well within it there most likely was a piece of information that was inappropriate, but would you like to see that taken off of the shelf? For example, I once read a series when I was in middle school that had inappropriate content about sexual interaction, but that series is what every girl wanted to read. If they would have taken them off the shelf because they were not appropriate then I know plenty more novels that would be gone as well.         What would you say if there was nothing left on the shelves to read, listen to, or to watch? Without items such as books we could have a hard time learning new stuff all the time. These are the items that teach us new things everyday. Would you be able to enjoy your life without being able to read, watching movies or @CAPS7 shows, or listening to music? It would be a very hard thing to get used to in today's society. We rely on such things @NUM1 to get us through the day and teach us things we were never taught.     Disagreeing with the quote that Katherine Paterson stated is one way to use @CAPS1 of @CAPS5 by stating my view of removing inappropriate items off of shelves. Removing items of the shelves won't solve the proplem of having too much inappropriate usage in today's society. If everything that had some kind of inapporpriate content in it removed from shelves, we would have a hard time finding a novel to read, music to listen to, a magazine to enjoy, and a movie or @CAPS7 show to watch. Lots of schools rely of books to read and without a book childrens vocabulary could have a great downfall.  Think about it...what would you be able to do in your free time if we had no more books, movies, magazines, or music"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4223	2	"Books, magazines, movies, music, etc, are all good to read, watch or listen to.      When I listen to music or watch movies or even read books sometimes. I wonder how do people come up with these ideas.The real reason is why people listen to music, read books watch movies are so offensive. In todays world you got music with all this negative stuff about people, talkin about people, with the curse words its not a good look for the people who make the music or the people who listen to the music. I feel that that stuff not be allowed in the shelves and it should be removed. Parents dont want there little children hearing that negative music. When they grow up they are going to be like them because everybody sings there songs and everything else.     I feel movies should not be removed from the shelves. The reason i say is because movies are funny, scary, sad etc.Sometimes u need the offensive in a movie, with out that it would not be good most of the time. One of my favorite is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and it was about character from the past @CAPS1 and @CAPS4 get back together and do one more mission. That movie was offensive but u still have a good time watchin it because its has the nice cars and good character. Movies should never get removed from the shelves cause out offensive of movies it would not be fun.People can not go to the movies with there friends and have a good time.If u are taking little kids out make sure u pick the right movies for them.To conclude argument Music is not bad thing to listen cause u have good music to but all im saying is make sure to watch what u listen to and get in trouble trying to do what they say in there music.To the movies keep comming out with good movies and keep making the movies good"	3	2		3	3	2	3																		
4230	2	"Offensive @CAPS1     @CAPS1. Books, music, magazines, movies, commericals. Is it right to have all types of @CAPS1 shown to all ages? I disagree. A variety of people could take offense to the content this @CAPS1 contains. I think that there should be a designated area, or all the alarming @CAPS1 should be removed so everyone can be at peace when they are at the library, or just watching television in their own home.      Even though some people @MONTH1 not take offense to any type of @CAPS1, you have to think about the parents. A majority of parents would not want their children to be surrounded by all the effects that this @CAPS1 brings. Some content @MONTH1 not be suitable to younger kids. Whether it be going to the movies or just going to the library, children can see all the violence and misbehaving going on in the world today. I believe that drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big influence on kids these days. I think it is our responsibilty to protect them until they are at an age they can make their own judgements.      Religion. Our religion plays a big part on what we think is right or wrong. I was taught to always treat people with respect and to try my hardest to get along with others. A lot of the @CAPS1 contradicts what I have been taught. If you see something on television with your favorite actor or actress on it, we tend to believe it is acceptable behavior. If you have ever been to a movie theater, you know they have certain ratings. The ratings are there to protect younger kids from getting into adult movies. They enforce this rule to an extent, but I don't think they enforce it enough. At the least, libraries and movie rental places could have a designated area for adult rated content to respect those who disagree.      A few years ago when my little sister was about two or three, she was watching a movie with me and it had a few curse words in it. She had never heard them that often and wasn't sure what they meant. For the next couple of days, she went around saying the word and my parents weren't very happy. She had no idea she was doing anything wrong because she heard it on a movie and if they could say it, then she could too. Children sometimes don't know any better and if they would happen to say it to a stranger, they would be offended.      @CAPS1 can be harmless, but it can also be offensive. The safest way to keep the new generation respectful, is to shield them when they are young so that they can learn what is right and what is wrong. When they come out into the real world, they won't be difficult to put up with and will have proper manners. No one will ever agree on the same things, but in the end, we need to do what is right for the betterment of our community."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4235	2	"Has anyone ever stopped and thought about the negative aspects of censoring a book? Many people of different beliefs take offense to books that show negativity to their ideas. When people are offended by a book the first idea that comes to mind is to try and get the book off the shelves by censoring it from libraries. I think that if a book offends a certain group of people they should just simply not read it.     Why should other people not get a chance to read a good book just because it offends someone else? Banning books would go against what our country stands for. How different would it make us if we started censoring books in our libraries like other countries with governments who have the final say on what can and can not be read?      Imagine what life would be like if all books found offensive were stripped from our shelves; there would be nothing left because anyone can find something offensive in any book. I understand that sometimes things written in books can really be disturbing ,and offensive but that doesnt give anyone the right to just take it off the shelves. Censoring books is a short term answer to a long term problem.     I believe that if we always resort to censoring books then we will become a less creative society. There are many people who @MONTH1 actually want to read a book but never get chance just because it is censored from library. Books that are censored are usually the books that help ones imagination. Would you want to live in a world where people are void of creativity?"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4240	2	"I think they souldnt be pulled off the shelves because everyone has different opions . one person @MONTH1 think a book is offensive but the next @MONTH1 not. Some people @MONTH1 think any books with god or jesus in the are offensive but that @MONTH1 just be because it is not there religion. If every person took off a book that they thought was offensive  there would be no books left. Because people think differently. Or some @MONTH1 not like the @PERSON1 books because of the violence and goryness but to some people those are there favorite books, so that would be unfair to the ones who like the books that others dont.

4241	2	"Censorship in libraries? Is it a problem? Should we fix this 'problem' or is it for the good? People of different culture, background, and life could be profound by these articles in readings. Can these books be offensive? They could be offensive to some but to others only educational. Statements have been made all over the world of people speaking on what they believe is right or wrong. How many people believe that censorship in libraries is really offensive and should be removed from libraries?     Who really are the victims when books and magazines are being thrown off the shelves? The author of that specific article that's who. If it is said that every reading that comes off offensive should be taken off the shelves, then what would be left on them. Some people @MONTH1 take romances being offensive or comedy or horror. Romance could be hurtful to someone only because they maybe just got out of an relationship, or comedy because they are miserable and don't know how to laugh anymore or know what happiness is. Who knows? Opinions such as these would be only terrible for business but also terrible for the educational and history part of life itself.           People of different races and cultures @MONTH1 have another opinion on the situation of censorship. From all over the world there are cultures spreading throughout. Born into a religion could be a huge affect on what their outcome is on a book, magazine, or a movie. Movies of past experiences or massacres that happened to a cultrue @MONTH1 be difficult for some people of that culture to take in. The normal response to a movie such as that would be to become angry or frustrated. Only for others it is an oppertunity to learn what those people went through and grieve for the loss of the people during that time. To support the people who made it through those heart breaking times and become a friend to them and learn more about them, their culture, and way of life.      Have you seen protests arouse before you? Anywhere in the world? On television, hear it on the radio, or see it in the newspaper. Everyone has most likely seen this type of protest or attack on the opinion of another person. There have been protest in the past of the freedoms of a person or even race. If everyone begins to complain and argue of what is being put on shelves in libraries. What will come of our world? What will we know about the past? What will we begin to predict for the future? Anyone, and even I can make observations of the acts going on around us. In my experience, I have seen of attacks being struck upon people who only put a picture in the newspaper, or a small article spoke out on television. Who are we to say that everything needs to be removed off the shelves in libraries? These are just people who have been hurt and don't want to relive that experience.      Overall, my opinion on if censorship in libraries should be extinguished. I believe the answer is no, every person in the world is going to be upset, hurt, or broken about something at least a million times in their life time from now on. Whether it be in books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else. They just need to understand that without any one person's culture that there would be no history of life before us"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4243	2	"In my way of viewing things i say that what i think is that the book, movies, music, and magazines should be put in critical order because some of us want or like to read or see stuff about what we want to see like the news that are in one way good to us, but some others like to see what's behind from the reality and want to speak up but they can because they are afraid that they would get hurt for speaking up. So i think that those things(books, music, movies, magazines) should not be removed from the shelfs because those books or movies can bring you what's going on in the world and how is affecting us in the way of not paying attention to it. Some experiences that i have is music i had once heard a song in spanish called '@CAPS1 The @CAPS2' and it talks about the corruption in @LOCATION1 and that how the people from the bottom suffer because of the people from the top do not care about them, also if you treat them as kings they will treat you as a slaves, and that if you give them the @CAPS2 to control you, they will take out advantage of it, how the honest people work hard to bring food to their homes, but its not enough because of the leaders on top that want all for them... its a very good song that says the true about it and that nobody does something to finished.So i don't want that songs or books that show the reality disapper because some people doesn't like them at all"	3	3		3	2	2	2

By: @PERSON1 to the harsh world we all live in, I do not believe it is morally correct for a program, of any kind, to hide the hard reality of our world from any person.      @CAPS1 will be @CAPS1 and one shouldn't ever hide what is true from the eyes of another person's mind. If one person makes the choice to close his eyes and go into a fantasy world then that is one person's right as a human being. However, one man has no right- whats so ever- to close the eyes of another person for them.     Personally, I myself am not afraid to look into the history of man's choices and take upon myself the burden of the harsh knowledge that I have inherited. I look at the human race of this planet to be whole and to be one with another. This planet doesn't belong to one race, nation or culture of people; it belongs to every single person equally. I made the decision to take on the resonsibility to know the past and use it's lessons to better the future. This world belongs to me as equally as it belongs to you; so my decisions will affect you as much as they affect me. That being stated, every person's decisions impact everyone, not just one's self.     People think that we should hide things that are 'offensive' to other people. Racism, world political issues, casualties of war and personal ethics- are some of these 'offensive' things. However, offensive or not, these subjects are very real and very much alive in our world; So why should anyone have the right to try to make these subjects dissappear for another person?      In @LOCATION1, everyone has the right to freedom of speech and expression, but how can these freedoms be carried through if people remove these expressed ideas and beliefs from the shelves of the readers? We all have a right to make the decisions that affect our world and if this world is equally owned by everyone, then everyone's decisions are equally burdened by everyone. That being said, we all have the right to know the decisions, actions, and the concequencies of these decisions and actions that our people all create every single day.     In conclusion, I believe that our world is harsh and also beautiful. Being that of which it is, I believe it is every man's right to live and decide the way he wants to. No man should ever make another person's decisions for them. Everyone is resonsible for their own life and how their life affects other people. However, no one has responsibility to hide or change the world around us from any person, for it is the knowledge of the people that make the world what it is and it is the knowledge of the world that influences a person's decisions"	4	5		4	4	4	4																		
4254	2	"Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 I have found that there has been a strong censorship in the libraries and I would like to express my strong disagreement for these actions. I have found that things have been removed from your shelves due to its content. Some of the content is vulgar and explicit and some is very offensive, but that still does not give you the right to remove these things. Books, movies, music, and magazines are very big parts of peoples lives and removing these things can be a big part of someones development.      First off you should not be taking books off of shelves for any means. There is a reason these books have been written and published nad it is because they have some meaning and can teach people or give them information on things they would not know otherwise. Taking books off shelves is pretty much just sheltering people, mostly kids, from information that would benefit them no matter in what way. Yes some books talk about sex, and yes some books have offensive terms but unless children are exposed to things like this they will not know that it is wrong. If they do not read books about how slaves were treated, they will never know about the slaves. If they never read a book about a married woman having an affair, they won't understand the significance of cheating. When people read these things they learn about them, and with a little common sense they can understand these things are wrong. Books should not be taken off the shelves in a @CAPS1 at any rate and movies should be looked at in the same manner.     Movies now a days have come along way. Flicks like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 use such a high form of technology that people would have no idea how it was done just a few decades ago. Some movies due contain very vulgar language and offensive terms and sometimes even nudity, and I can relate to not wanting a little child to see that. This does not mean that these things should be removed from the @CAPS1 though. In all honesty I do not want my little brother or sister walking past a @CAPS5 container with a picture of a girl in lingerie on the front and I do not think anyone else is ok with that. Other movies should be put on display for kids to rent though. Movies that can teach them history although there is very graphic content. Movies that will help them learn how not to do somethings like kill or rape. Movies that can show these things but also teach how incredibly horrible these things are at the same time. I think that the movies that go past this should be put into an adult only section and I do not think any pornography should be put on display anywhere, but movies need to be available to a very high extent. Movies are very good teaching tools and magazines follow that same path.      In the world today we have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1 that are jam packed with information that can better kids from a young age to even people who have been out of school for a while. I feel like some educational magazines @MONTH1 be graphic and show things that children should not see but on the other hand, seeing it will help them understand. Now I am not saying I want to put @CAPS6 magazines on display for people to see and learn about how little of clothes some girls can wear but magazines that @MONTH1 show the very little amount of clothes people are forced to wear in countries in @LOCATION1. They should be able to view magazines that could show, a little more on the nude side, of people who are starving because they only can eat twice a week. Things like this although can be very offensive maybe to some people should be viewed because it can teach. It will show kids that these people need help and they can be those people that help them. Once again pornography should not be available at anytime but other magazines that have an educational aproach but could contain some naughty things due to the teaching should be able to be heard. Magazines should be available but on the other hand you have to take a more careful approach to music.      Music is probably the hardest to figure out, of these censored things I have spoken of today. People use music to express feelings. Whether those feelings are good or bad they get them out through song. Music is something that brings people together and allows them to be unique at the same time. Music should not be taken away from people going into a @CAPS1 because of its vulgar content or anything of that matter. There is a thing called the 'clean' version of pretty much any song that has curse words in it. Songs that cannot be cleaned up or are not available in that way I can undertstns why they are taken off the sheleves but other than that I think everything should be made available. Music can be so powerful to people and taking it away is not the right thing to do.     In conclusion the censorship should not be done. Yes there are somethings that have to be removed due to the extremeness contained in it but if things can be learned from I feel like it should stay no matter what. People go to a @CAPS1 to learn and there are so many tools that can be used to teach them. Music, movies, magazines, and books can be such a big part of peoples lives and taking these things from them is not right"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4264	2	i fell that this test is stupid i hate reading and writing. i think that you all should only make sure that we can read on level and write on level bc alot of kids arn't even going to really try on this test till like their @NUM1 or @NUM2 grade year and also alot of teachers dont even teach this material till the end of the year           so i think that some of the stuff that u all test on should be changed like the stuff you test on and how long the test is and should be more focest on reading and writing levels     however i do agree that the test should still be here because it helps felter people who passed the class by cheating and who passed it by hard work     i think there should be an alternative test that is taken on paper to because some kids test better on paper then on a computer     this is the way i feel about the test. i know i was supose to write about offensive material but i couldnt think how i felt about it and this is the stuff that was on my mid so i thought i would enform u think you very much	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
4276	2	"What other people take as offensive might be taken to others as something they value. I believe that all sorts of books, music, and magazines should stay on the shelves at the library. People value many different things and we need to give others an opportunity to explore what else there is.                                                Different types of books explain different types of things. Some people connect with books in a way that others @MONTH1 not understand. Taking certain types of books away can risk other peoples feelings. Taking music, in my opinion, would be the worst because people get lost in some types of music. They use music to escape their probems and taking that away can leave them helpless. People love movies. It helps people understand what is going on in other peoples point of views. Taking away movies could leave people with no entertainment. People like different movies and some movies can be offensive. But, it's not up to anybody else. Magazines help people keep up with news. Most of the news can be very offensive. It is the people around you causing the offensive news. Taking away magazines can be keeping people from the latest gossip and news.                                          Taking away things that people use to connect with, what they use to escape with, their entertainment, and the news would most likely cause peoepl to act out in a bad way. Everybody is defferent and everybody likes different things and taking away something that others think is offensive is unfair to the people that think it isn't. What if somebody thought what you liked was inappropriate? How would you feel?"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4285	2	"Do people take offensive books serious. There are lots of stuff in book that people @MONTH1 think is offensive. Some other people @MONTH1 think differently. I pretty sure libraries have censored shelves, but if not people shouldn't get so worried about it and here are ways.     I feel that certain materials that young people see in books, music, and movies are at the library. They see stuff that's around them. they also see what there mentor and parents are doing/watching too. The author of the quote (Katherine Paterson) can't just blame it all on the library.     In the paragraph I wrote before this I said that children see things that there metor and parents are doing. Now today in the @NUM1 century parents really don't keep a good eye things and what they leave out for what they child can get. Kids like to play with stuff they first see. If parents don't want there child seeing offensive material and other stuff on the shelves in a library then they should watch what they kids are doing more carefully and watch over their backs.     I really don't care that the shelves in libraries are offensive. I just don't pay any attention to it anyway. We are living in a better world that it was years ago. If people still are getting mad over petty stuff like that, then what are they still here for. When young children get older they are going to end up seeing things that they coudn't see that's still going to be on the shelves in a library.     We shoudn't take books offensive. After all they are just words on a piece of paper. I believe that offensive materials and other stuff should stay on the shelves of library. Besides some people need to know the truth sometimes in order to understand stuff more clearly."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4291	2	"Censorship, @CAPS1 or @CAPS2?          I can understand why libraries would decide to keep certain books off their shelves. Libraries are a place for learning and work. If you were sitting near someone at a public library who was reading smut you could feel awkward.      Although some people @MONTH1 find certain items unoffensive, other @MONTH1 disagree. Imagine you are a mother with a young child who decided to wonder through the library. Your child finds a magazine. It's '@CAPS3'. Not something that you are going to want to explain to your child. If the library were to have not kept the magazine, it never would have happened. Libraries are a public place that should be taken seriously.    If people really want to find something that is inappropriate they can find it somewhere else. The modern world today makes it easy for people to find just about anything without a large hassle. Therefore it should be fine to keep certain materials out of our libraries.      How can people take libraries seriously if there are dirty books, or books with rude language, and scandalous themes. If you are trying to get work done or learn and there are distracting items on the shelves then it @MONTH1 make things more difficult. Libraries are serious places and should be treated as such."	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
4296	2	"Dear Newspaper,      I would like to start off by saying yes, books, magizines, music, movies, etc., are great for the kids in the library.  I think thats the best thing for them to do when they dont have anything to do, go to the library and read or work on stuff in the library and I think that some things should be in the library because we are in high school and we need to learn some things here but some of the things we learn are not very appropriate.      In high school just walking down the hall ways your going to learn alot of things you probably dont need to know yet but when you walk into  a library they dont need to encourage it by putting  books of drugs, alcohol, and sex on the shelves.       Books about drugs are alright to an extent.  If your reading about medicanes you can take and being in the doctors office and getting percriptions is alright but when you got books about pot, weed, crank, or meth thats a little much.  We need to learn about those drugs and what they could do to us if we use them or abuse them but we dont need to know how to roll a blunt or make meth.      Books about alcohol are the same way.  We need to know the dangers of drinking but we dont need to know about teen parties and things to do when your drunk.       Advertisements, magizines, etc., are the worst things for us kids because everyone of them have something to do with drugs, alcohol, or sex and trying to get us to do those thing in high school. The front cover of magizines always have people who have got caught with drugs who is dating or sleeping around with who and ik that we will and need to know these things but i dont think we need to read them out of books because then we read it and see how other people did it and we feel the need to do it or try it.     I believe these books that are over the line about alcohol, drugs, and sex need to be taking out of the librarys so that the kids have something to learn about and ask there parents about.  I have been in the librarys and I know for a fact that the first books I go for have one of those three invloved in it because those are interesting and we like reading about stories at parties or someone getting pregnant or an @ORGANIZATION1 but also when I read I think about it and I think I want to go to a party they made them sound fun.     This is what I think about some of those books on the selves and what I think should happen.                                                                       Sinceraly,                                                            @LOCATION1"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4300	2	"Books can always be amazing things in how they take us to whole new worlds and how they enlighten us to new ideas we @MONTH1 have never thought about before.  However, are some books just too much to handle and should not be read?  Well think what you @MONTH1, but I believe all reading and media materials should stay on their shelves in libraries because people should have a right to know what is in the real world, even some of the bad parts.  Different assortments of media should definately not leave libraries or be banned from them because people need to be educated in all that exists, they need to know even the bad things in this world so they can hopefully be educated enough about it they can go away from evil acts and help fight against them, and first and foremost it is their right to choose what they want to read because each individual must have the option to be who they want to be.  Though we can only hope that by giving people such knowledge they can rise up and do what is right.     Even education @DATE1 is being influenced by people saying that students can not be taught certain realms of knowledge, but in the long run does this really help people?  If people were educated enough to know about everything we know and what they themselves as an individual choose to learn, wouldn't that help them from becoming curious and learning lies from an invalid source, instead of the array of resources they would have open to them at a library?  Each individual should have the right to learn what they want to learn and should not be closed off from any resources, otherwise they @MONTH1 never learn the real truth behind a topic, which would work against the whole point of learning.  These seekers of knowledge should always be able to seek as they please, so that they @MONTH1 learn and hopefully make new advancements for everyones benefit, but they can only hope to this with proper education.         Another point to look at is that people need this variety of education, so they can work for causes important to them.  With knowledge people can make new innovations and create and spread new ideas to help make the world better.  Although  this can only happen when they know both sides of the story, so that if they oppose something they can know what they are talking about and what they are pushing against and what cause they are pushing for.  The only way people can truly make their ideas heard will be when they can understand all about their topics.  Without certain points of information that could be taken out, people @MONTH1 have no backbone to what they are saying and then they would even hamper other people's learning processes as well.     Also another reason to not have censorship is that we all have rights in @LOCATION1,and hopefully globaly someday, to be who we want to be in the pursuit of happiness as long as we do not hinder anyone else's dreams in our own pursuit.  People really just need to be who they really are in order to help the world and make differences, because if we were not allowed to be our own individuals then people would never advance.  Without this advancement, people would have just remained the same in their cultures and beliefs, but instead people chose to seek knowledge, and in doing so gave us the technology people have @DATE1.  Harry @CAPS1 even argues in his popular books series that we must know the enemy to fight them.  Would he have become such a hit if others didn not believe this as well?  To change this would go against the rights people have found for themselves, thus meaning if we gave these rights away, people would have regressed.       People should always be allowed to access all types of media, especially in librairies.  These media types help shape who each individual is and helps them to help make contributions to the world in their lives.  Though there wil;l always be bad media, we must understand even the bad in this world, so that hopefully people will make the choice to combat it.  We all certainly would not be the people we are @DATE1 without all the influences on us and by taking away even parts of knowledge we would end up only dehabilatating ourselves.   These choices all help us to hopefully advance and continue forward into the depths of understanding, so that knowledge will continue on forever"	4	5		4	4	4	4																		
4301	2	"I believe that if some people don't like a certain book or movie then they should be able to tell the library about that itme and it should be removed from the library. The library should allow people who use the library to take away things that are offensive to its customers.     Some parents who come into a library with their children let their children go off and look at books by themselves which is what my @CAPS1 used to let me do when I was a kid. If children are by themselves with no adult supervision and wander into an adult reading section they could look at something bad. They could also buy a magazine that looks perfectly fine on the outside but have offensive images on the inside.      When I was ten years old, my family and I went on vacation to @LOCATION1. We were watching a baseball game that was on commercial break one night. We were fliping through the channels wating for the game to come on. We were all watching the television when an offensive image came on the televison that children's eyes shoudn't see. That occurance happened when I nor my parents wanted me to see it. That image was an adult image and was meant for adults only, but childrens eyes can see it as well. Libraries should think of this when they are puting books and magazines on their shelves. They might be making a little bit of money but they are effecting a childs life in a negative way. Things like this could happen in a library also because children who are young won't always know what is a childs book and what is an adult magazine. Children also might ask their parents for music that the case of the music might look fine on the outside, but have cursing and bad things on the inside. This is the reason why all items in a library that are offensive to people should be removed from libraries.     If people who go to the library don't like something on the shelves they should be able to ask the library to take the item off the shelve. The libray might not do it everytime, but taking items off the shelves would make libraries more enjoyable and safe for children. If the library doesn't take the items off the shelve it could effect their business in a negative way. The library should only take off the items that regular visitors to the library ask for. The library shoudn't listen to someone who has visited the library only a few times. The library should listen to its customers that visit the library often.      I think that all offensive images to people that visit the library should be taken off the shelves and removed from the library. The library should listen to its customers not only because it could effect their business, but becasue it could effect the lives of children in a positive or negative way."	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
4309	2	I don't think certin matrials should be removed from library shelvs. People have the option to get what they choose from the shelvs the lirarians don't force them to choose the item. It is a free country and i think people should choose what they wan't. If the people don't like it then read the back of the movie or book before you choose it.	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
4314	2	"There are a lot of issues concerning offensive material that are used for entertainment purposes. Sometimes these things should not be on the shelves. Such as movies, books, magazines, etc., they can be seriously offenseive to other people that are different races or different religions.     Censorship can be used to solve this problem, like in the book @CAPS1 @NUM1, it was used to keep books out of the picture completely. To keep the society from becoming offended, or for that matter, thinking. However in this matter it is the complete opposite, having all kinds of negative material and not caring what it can do to other people, or @MONTH1 damage other people.     However this can also be argued. The people that are offended by the material, wether religious or race, really don't have to be around the material in the first place. For example if the material is in a library, then the people don't need to go to the library.           In conclusion people don't have to be near the offensive stuff if they are offended, but people should not be so cruel also."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4326	2	"Library Censorship     Libraries shouldn't have 'offensive' books removed from shelves. Parent supervision, librarian supervision, and your own common sense are three of the reasons why books shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are considered to be offensive.     Parent supervision is one of the top priorities for knowing what your children read. If they don't want their children to grow up being 'stupid' then they should teach them to focus on educational books more. When they see their child in a row of books that they think is inappropriate, then they should remove their child from that area and take them to another area.     The librarian's supervision is also an important priority. Maybe they don't know the children's actual age, but if the librarian sees them in a place that they think is inappropriate for someone around their age, show them another book shelf. Just like parents, librarians will try to find an educational book that the child @MONTH1 enjoy. But, librarians obviously like to read since they are around books all day, so the child @MONTH1 be lucky and the librarian finds an adventure book for the child, or something else that the child finds interesting.     The person's common sense is also a reason why 'offensive' books shouldn't be removed from libraries. Most people know how old they are and what kind of books they should read. If they are in an area of the library that other people @MONTH1 think is inappropriate for them to read, go to a different area.     Once again, I don't think there should be a censorship in libraries. If parents want their children to read books that won't 'rot your brain' then they should observe what books their child reads, trust the librarian to show them the correct books to read, and expect their child to have good common sense"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4329	2	"You are the mother or father of a young child, and you take them to the library. While there, you see some advertising for a new book. The sign is all bright and flashy, so you stop to read it. It turns out to be advertising a book and some movies that you believe should not even be available here, for they are far to inappropriate and offensive. What would you do?      Personally, I believe that if you see something like that, that you believe is offensive, you should say something. Talk to the librarian and state your case about what is going on. Having offensive articles in a public library where kids of all ages go to do their homework, is just plain wrong.      What if that certain library had no restrictions on who checked out what? So many kids could check things like that out, and not even know what it actually is! Could you imagine your child coming home from the library, and handing you a book, magazine, or movie that was way beyond anything they should ever see at that age? It would be disasterous! I @MONTH1 not have children, but I do have younger cousins. I know for a fact that if they brought home something inapproproate or offensive, their parents would be having a major talk with the librarian.     Libraries should have major restrictions on what gets checked out by who. For example, my library has three different kinds of library cards. One card is just to check out regular books. Another is so you can check out movies, music, and books. Then the third and final card is so you can check out books, music, and movies from the adult section in a small room at the back of the library. However, to even be eligible for the third card, you have to be eighteen or older.      I strongly believe that if a library does carry materials some @MONTH1 find offensive, they need to be kept in a small room at the back of the library, or behind the librarians desk. This way, noone who does not want to see the materials doesn't have to. If someone did want to see or check out these materials, they should need proof that they are eighteen or older. This would make it easier for the librarian to keep track of who looks at or checks out the materials.     Another thing, what if someone finds something offensive that someone else doesn't? Well, I honestly think that at least two or three people should comment on it being inappropriate or offensive, before it is actually taken off the shelf. If more than one person does say something, the librarian should place the book, magazine, movie, music, ect., in with the other offensive materials, where there is an age restriction.      This is how it is at my neighboorhood library, and I strongly believe that this library is a model for all libraries wanting to have more restrictions. If all libraries had more restrictions, it would be better off for everyone. Parents would not have to worry about their young children wandering around and finding something that is totally wrong for them. Older teenagers and young adults would be able to get their homework or projects accomplished without having all the distractions of the offensive materials.      In conclusion, I hope you take all that I have said to heart. I hope you write an article talking about the restrictions in libraries, and how they would make everything better off. Thank you for taking the time to read this"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4330	2	I believe that some materials in the libary should be taken off. Some people @MONTH1 find them offensive because they might have bad things in them. Some types of music have bad language in them and people dont want little kids finding them. If a little kid saw that stuff then they would learn bad things. And they would say it in front of everybody and then everybody would being saying it.     Alot of books are ok to read because they dont have bad things in them. some people like reading books that have drama and some people dont. Most books re ok to read. But some can have langauge in them and ahouldnt be aloud in the libary. But they can still be in there because some people might want to read them. If people dont want to read them then they shouldnt get them.     Some movies have bad stuff in there. That kind of stuff should not be in there because alot of people dont want to watch movies like that. And if a kid would walk in there and get one and if it had that stuff and the parent fount out then the libary could get sewed for having that stuff. So they should be taken out of the libary so people wont get them. The libary can keep children movies in there to watch because they are not bad.     If i worked at a libary then i would take magazines out. Sports magazines would be ok to keep in there. But alot of the others ones should not be there because they have alot of bad things in there and i wouldnt let people take them so i wouldnt have them in there. But sports and stuff would be ok because sports are not bad for people to read. People like reading about sports because it is interesting to read.     That is just what i thank. Other people might see it the other way and they can. People are different and they will thank different things. Some people might want to read that and some people dont. So it just shows you that people are different because they thank things different then other people do. And some libaries have that stuff and some dont. sp if you are one of those people that like that stuff then go to one of them that have that stuff. And if you are one of those people that dont then go to one that dont have that stuff so you can get what you want and they can get what they want	3	3		3	2	2	2

4359	2	"Killings, murders, and homosexual books can all be offensive to one person or another, but that doesn't mean they should be taken away. That is like saying I get offened by homework, take it out of @ORGANIZATION2. Some of the most interesting books to read are about murders, I think. I belive they shouldn't be taken out or else no teenage kids would read in @ORGANIZATION1. Teenages like to have mystery and romance. I know that one of my favorite books, The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, would offend some people because it has murder in it. That certainly doesn't mean it was not a good and interesting book for me. They can just over look these books and pick another.     If you want to keep your @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 students interested you shouldn't take out book that might offend someone. By taking out some books not everyone would be happy. Some kids might not even read any more because you took the best books out of the library. Every book in one way or another would offend someone. They just need to overlook those books and read a diffrent one. I have seen some books at my @ORGANIZATION2 that offended me, but i did not tell the libraian to take it out of the @ORGANIZATION2. Another student might have loved to read that book.      Everyone has diffrent oppions so there would not be any books left if they took out all the offensive ones. The only books that would be left would be @PERSON1 the @CAPS3 and children books. I do not know of any @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 student that would want to read @PERSON1 the @CAPS3 and give a speech about it in class. I'm not sure how the teachers could do book reports any more; all the books we read in class could offend someone. If everything that offened someone was taken out of the schoolt there would be nothing left of the @ORGANIZATION2. See everyone has a diffrent oppion on everything. That just isn't right.      In conclusion, books that offend someone shouldn't be taken out of schools and librarys. They keep the @ORGANIZATION2 students reading and growing. With out some of these books I myself wouln't like reading. So lets be mature aldults and keep all the books on the shelves and ignore the books that offend us"	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
4361	2	"Are offensive materials offensive to everybody? Does everyone think the same material is offensive? Who is to say what is or is not offensive? Offensive material can be anything someone wants to think of. Children are going to see this material anyways, weither we take it away of not. Offensive material, such as cursing or rage, is a form of expression and of releaving stress. Such things can also show anger, hate, and depression.      Children will see and hear offensive things anyways. Even as it is now, parents try to hid such things from their children. this makes them curious. They will do anything to understand it. Offensive things are part of everyday life. The more you hid it, the more children will seek it out.     In movies, books, and music, this is a form of expression. it releaves stress, rage, and shows this so that @CAPS1 is a true picture of what is going on. People cannot imagion someone truly angery in a book when it says, '... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You don't know what you have done!'...' You cannot show foreshadowing, or show the anger. You cannot see how a character truly feels. For example, '... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You will parish! You don't know what you have done! Death will come!'...' @CAPS1, you have an idea of how the author will play out the story and how the character really feels. You can see the foreshadowing. The author could be saying that a good man has died, who was going to stop evil, or an evil man died, and people will revenge him.     In such ways, this can show anger. Some people would find the example offensive or out of line. Cursing to me is not offensive. But, they show how the character, writer, or singer feels when it was written without it having to state it. Offensive material can also grief. This shows that someone is hurt by what has happened, amplifying the story. allowing the reader, watcher, or listener to expect more and want more. So the reader, watcher or listener would wait for more, and by the music, book, or movie. It puts intrest into the material.     Only certain people can agree on something offensive. Such as family, friends, or a group of close people. But, it applies foreshadowing, intrest, anger, grief, and sometimes, passion. Your children will see it if they truly want to. So, why get rid of something that they will see anyways? Something that intersts them and makes them want to read more, watch or make movies, or listen to or make music. Why would something that, yes, is offensive to some, but would grab promote and keep some within it"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4364	2	Ok some books can be really offensive and some magazines can be bad like this one sports magazine i read talked about some atheletes and their accidents. like one article was talking about @PERSON1 playing basket ball and he had the stomach flu and he was having a hard time playing cause he had to use the bathroom alot.'I mean who would want to let the world know that they used the bathroom on themselves'. thats bad! And another thing why do libraries have books that have sexual things in them. Theres quiet a few books that are like that for an example theirs this book called 'wake' and its about a girl who gets pulled into other peoples dreams like there was this girl who had a dream and it was sexual i thought wow why is this book in here. It also had alot of cursing in it i enjoyed it but i think it should be removed from the librarie. Cause theres kids that arent of age so they should'nt read them. i dont know thats all i have to say right now other then look at what your kids read theses days you might get upset	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
4367	2	"I don't believe that we should romove any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from our libraries due to many reasons.  This is the real world and the things you read about or watch in a movie @MONTH1 be something you don't want your kids to read about or even see.  Life is about learnig new things. To learn about these ideas, you usually read about or see them somewhere.  The only way I would ever remove any of these items from a store is if they were going to seriously harm the people or have a negative effect on them.      If I were to walk into a public library and I saw a book about a girl cutting herself or someone killing another person, I would be the type of person to turn away from it; even thought it is what many kids are reading about today.  Of coarse, every library has books that cover all kinds of topics.  If you were a parent that was worried about your child reading about these kinds of things, well welcome to life.  Most books have a true story behind them and I believe that everyone needs to learn about this kind of stuff sometime in their life.  Most of what we learn today comes from the books we read.     Also, everyone today listens to music.  We find music as a way to relax and have a good time wheather your riding in a car or at a party.  Many of the songs today contain foul language and have sexual meanings, but that doesn't mean that you have to listen to them.  Many older people don't want to listen to these kinds of songs but it is what many kids are listening to today.  What many people don't see though, is that these songs have true meaning behind them and it is really a way of life.     Finally, I believe that magazines, movies, and any other types of media, shouldn't be removed from libraries.  Many people turn to magazines as a way to relax and read about the latest fashions or their favorite athlete.  We watch movie to also relax and have a good laugh every once in a while.  No one should remove these sources of entertainment from our people even if some @MONTH1 think they are inappropriate.       I strongly believe that romoving any books, magazines, movies, music, or any other typed of media would have a negative effect on alot of people.  You would be removing sources of entertainment and ways of learning from people.  How would you feel if you went to your local library one day and most, if not all, materials had been removed?  What would you do if you didn't have any of these materials available to you anymore"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4370	2	"No I as an @CAPS1 cetazine do not feel that any materials should be removed. There are many reason I feel this way and I hope that after people have read this they will agree with me. THere are three main points supporting my opinion and i plan to list them below.      First and for most is the fact that this is @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is suposed to be the land of the free and the home of the brave, or at least thats what the national anthem tells me. So to me if some one removes a book or movie from a library becasue they find it offencive they are trying to take away one of my right as an @CAPS1 cetacine. The right they are messing with to me is the right of freedom. I should be free to be able to walk into a library and grab any book i wish. I should be free to go to the movie store and find and rent any movie a choose from the shelf. If they put a movie or book away if they make it to were i can't get to it then they are messing with my freedom, and this is somthing i can't stand as an @CAPS1. I should be free to read or watch what ever i choose to.     Which brings me to my next point. This point is a simple and logical one. My second point is that people have the choice to read or watch the movie. Just because it is there it does not meen that they have to read or watch it. If someone doesn't like a book good for them don't read it. If someone doesn't like a movie good for them don't watch it. It is rather quit simple in my opinion if someone doesn't like said book or movie then just leave it alone and don't mess with it. They shouldn't have the right to ruin it for everone else. Just because one or two or even twenty people find a book offencive doesn't mean they have the right to remove it. There @MONTH1 five million other people out their who love said book so why ruin for everyone just to make a few people happy. They do have the right to say no and not read or watch the movie, but they don't have the right to say i can't.     Finaly people say that said book or movie should be removed because a child might get it and it is not apropreat for children. Well to that I have to say it is the parents job to make sure a child is not readind or watching something they shouldn't. If i child gets a hold of a book that is said to be bad it is the parents job to tell them to put it back. People don't have the right to completly remove said book or movie just because a kid might get it.      So there is my opinion on this little matter. I don't feel that libraries should be censored. I feel we all have the right o make own decisions and that we have the right to read or watch what ever we choose. It is not fair to get ride of a book just because a few people don't like it. Hundreds of othes might love it, and like I said before if someone doesn't like a certain movie or book then don't read it or watch it. Don't ruin it for everyone else though."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4378	2	"Whever you go these days you see viloence in evry store around the world. Children growing up in the world is our future and they see that negative output. Alot of the kids and young adults thrive off of the offensive materials the world puts out there.               I think that the offensive thing's should be taken off the shelves. And sold in stores for adults that are twenty one and older. If people sell offensive things in stores were it allows young teenagers to buy those products , then we are just puting ourselfs at harm. I was just in a book store the other day and i seen magazines that were not apporiate. I thought to myself how could they sell these types of magazines. Music , movies, and magazines shouldn't even be sold in a book store , that's why its called a book store.                It's not called a movie, music , or magazine store they call it a book store for a reason. If students read books or listen to music that is offensive they are going to grow up thinking it's ok. Too be that way or treat somebody different because of who they are or what they represent. I'm not saying take all the books out of the store just take the offensive one's and have a twenty one or older sign. So the kids dont end up getting a hold of the book and learning something they shouldn't.               When i was young i went to the book store all the time with my mom. I would just pick up any book there was and start trying to read. Alot of the time my mom would take the book from me. Because it was offensive, i didn't know that at the time i was just a little kid. In today's society kids are growing up quicker than they really have to and thats not a good thing. Kids should be able to be kids and read kid's books.               I guess it does'nt really matter for middle school and high school kids. Because those kids really dont like to read at all. The kids that we have to look out for is the one's in elementary. Because those kid's actually want to learn how to read. And if we put a book about drugs on the shelve those kids will read it. And those kids will learn about it and be curious to what that drug has a effect on you.               In the end it does'nt really matter what i say because people are going to keep making books. Anytime type of book it is all based on how much money they can make. It does'nt matter if it is negative or a possitive book. the company wants to make money and so does the author."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4384	2	"I do not believe that materiales in libraries should be censored. If parents don't want their children reading or listening to inappropriate things, they should pay more attention to what they are doing. If parents monitor their children closer they will be able to control what they are doing. There are alot of bad things for children to read, look at, and listen too out there. Parents need to do a better job teaching their children about what they can and should look at, read, or listen too.     It isn't often when you go to the library that you find something inappropriate unless you are looking for something inappropriate. It is very easy to tell what is good and what is bad. Most of the time in a library the more profound books and magazines are seperated from the childrens books. This, to me, is the way it should be in all libraries. In all of the times i have been to a library i have never accedentally come across something inappropriate. A library is a place for people of all ages it should not be limited to just one age group.     If libraries were censored more people would be upset. It would be the same way if a store stopped selling your favorite product because one person did not like it. Alot of adults probably would not go if the library were censored. The library would then become a place for mostly children. Most small children do not even go to the library so they would become virtually useless.     In all of my years I have never once heard of someone being deeply offended by something at a library. Weather it be in a magazine, on the news, or by word of mouf, I have never seen a complaint. Most parents do a good job of monitering what the children look at or read. Those parents should not be deprived of their privelages to look at more adult rated things if they choose. Just because one parent was to irresponsible to moniter their child does not mean that all of the parents should be punished.     The library is a place for people of all ages. Therefor the library should keep material for people of all ages and not just for children. The bottomline is that if people do not want their kids looking at inappropriate things they should keep a better watch over them. They should also teach them the difference in what is acceptable and what is not acceptable."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4385	2	"Censoring books in libraries because a certain group of people doesn't like them, and finds them offensive is simply not fair.  A good library is diverse and has something that everyone of different backgrounds can enjoy.                 A compromise wouldn't be as difficult as some people might actually think.  Simply regulating books, and other products, by creating age limits based on the books content and maturity level would be an excellent alternative to actually censoring the books themselves.  Take an author like @PERSON1 for example.  His books contain subject matter and offensive crude language that would obviously not be deemed acceptable for most younger people.  That being said censoring the books language wouldn't help in the slightest. If a younger person has the mental capability to read a book like @PERSON1 then they would have no problem making inferences on what matierial was said, and the ideas in the writing are going to be realized.                  The other fact is that taking out mature level books completley from the libraries is not a possible solution either. If you take out the diversity in your product your going to lose the diversity in your customer's as well. For instance think about a movie store. If the only movies sold were @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 there would be a lot less people wanting to go to that store, because then it just turns into a child's store. Even censoring the movies would not be effective because your taking away the art of having an unfiltered movie.                   So my simple solution is obvious. Movies have ratings based on maturity content, so why shouldn't books. Books that deal with more controversal content shouldn't be placed in the shelves next to young readers' books, and they should have a label indicating that the specific book @MONTH1 contain material not suitable for a person under a specific age. People trying to censor entertainment and look into the best interest of their loved ones is perfectly fine, but you cant blindfold them forever. Were all on the same planet and we all reach the age of realization of reality."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4387	2	"Do you think books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that could be offenesive should or should not be pulled off the shelves? I beleave they shouldn't. All kinds of people buy books or movies and they all have diffrent types they like.     Companies that manufactor books, movies, music, and magazines would be looseing out on money if people cant find something they like. and if they dont have the money to make whatever it is they make then they will go out of buiesness. They you might be out of luck for what you are looking for.     All kinds of people buy things that they like. How would you like it if your favorite candy was taken off the shevles because it offened people? Well thats how they feel when that happens to them.      What would be put in there places? Stores have to have something to fill the shevles. Would they put more candy to make the world fat?      If you come across something you think is offensive just dont pay attenion to it. Others @MONTH1 like it like you like your favorite candy. We have a great number of other things you can pick from"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4388	2	"A curious child goes into the library for the first time to find a story to read. Yet, when she goes to the children's section, the book she wants is not allowed in this library becuase it is said to promote certain ideals to children. The child goes to her older sister for help to find a different book. The older sister is to busy looking for her own book. She had walked into the library looking to find answers to her questions over a liberal topic. She can't find the book she wants, the library has censored it.      Why would we censor librairies if we have the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech? It is not right to censor libraries becuase that is restricitng what is allowed to be read, which is taking away part of our freedom. The press is allowed to print anything, and we the people read it. Will that be the next thing that is censored? A book is just like the newspaper, it is relaying a story to entertain the auidence that is reading it.      By censoring libraires that is taking away the freedom of speech. Writing is a way to express yourself. Authors share there expressions through writing, hoping they can touch someone else's life and be of some assistance. Whether the book helps its reader to escape a horrendus day or to answer the questions of a curious teenager. I use books daily to escape the stresses of life, the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series gave me something to do and allowed me to use my imagination and mind, I could escape into another world and leave my chores behind me.      Some @MONTH1 say that offensive things should be censored. In our culture the slightest thing can called 'offensive' now. If we never learn about these 'offensive' things how would we understand history? There will always be rude things that have been said, but we should be exposed to them so we can learn from it. By censoring these items we will never learn and  neither will our children about other cultures, history, or liberal ideas.      Instead of censoring items, there is another solution. Make certain items restricted and red flagged. If certain items become restricted; it would mean that people over a certain age are allowed to read them. By doing this a child's mind would not be polluted, but we could still be exposed to different ideas and learn from them. If there was a system to red flag an item, this would allow the reader to know that this item contains what could be considered offensive material so they do not have to expose their selves to it if they did not want to, but others could. This would work becuase the books could stay in the library and still be used but there would be a warning system for those who do not want to be around it or allow their children to be around it.      In conclusion censoring libraries is a bad idea. It takes away our freedom of the press and speech.We are also making ourselves ignorant this way. If we put out a warning system it is fair to everyone. The 'offensive' matterial can stay in the libaries but people will know ahead of time what they are being exposed to and what their children are to"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4396	2	"Do your rights end where mine begin? In such a diverse society, clashing opinions are unavoidable. Does that mean another human's rights should be abused because we don't agree with their practices, beliefs, or lifestyle?     Everyone in this world is entitaled to their own opinion. What is wrong to some people @MONTH1 be right to others. For example, one family @MONTH1 view their children using curse words as offensive while another @MONTH1 see no problem. Diversity in beliefs does not mean that it is acceptable to censor society from cursing, religion, or violence disscused in published works. These concepts exist in the world and censoring them will not make them disappear.     It is understood that there is both bad and good in the world, and pulling materials from the shelves of libraries will not change that. Censoring books, magazines, music, and other media is denying someone the ability so see ideas from all points of view. Whether or not you prevent a young child from seeing all perspecitves does not mean the bad and good do not exist. The saying 'one year older, one year wiser' can refer to the aknowledgement of different ideas and opinions. As a child grows, he will learn more about the materials that were censored.     In some cases, such as in the classroom, your rights do end where mine begin. When it comes to learning about the beauty of diversity, everyone is able to choose what they pick from the shelf. The definition of 'offensive material' is simply a matter of opinion."	4	3		4	4	4	4																		
4400	2	"Billions of books float from shelf to shelf each day: fictional and nonfictional, horror and comedy. Writers reside in every part of the world composing works from complex life experiences to simple dreams. Being an author, who has the right to freedom of speech, story plots become to have endless combinations. Every reader seeks out a different style.          Libraries contain books that tower to the ceilings, any kind, every kind. Books are divided into their individual sections according to truth, kind and cover, each category holding about four options. The necessity for censorship should never be an option. Writers compose for all sorts of people. For some to say what's 'right' or 'wrong' is not a legitamate reason for a piece of work to be removed from a shelf. If, perhaps, more books had ratings such as movies do, an @CAPS1 @NUM1 cubicle could be created instead of allowing young people to have access to such vulgarity. Taking away the enjoyment for some readers, however, is unethical.          Whether pertaining to books, music, magazines, etc., censorship is unnecessary. Those who compose the entertainment should not have to worry about the content of their expression and/or interpretation. If the worry is concerning youth, parental guidance should be in affect. Resulting in cancellation can affect those who relate to the source so it's important to consider all options. To each, its own."	4	3		4	4	4	4

I don't believe that they shouldn't take out censorship items out of the libraries just becase some people have a problem with it.Becase now a days you can go out in public and hear the same stuff they put in those censored movies,games,@CAPS1's,etc.I think that if they are even thinking about taking cencored product out of the library it should be up to the library and not the goverment.     If censorship is such a big problem with people they dont have to check it out or look at it. So maybe if they are having problem's with parents becase there kids are checking he censored items out they should have a band.Like if you want to out a item with a censorship you either have to be @NUM1 or have a parent or guardin with you.But if it is still have a problem with it make it like tabacco products were you have to be @NUM1.     Then if the libraries don't want to do that they could make a whole room just for censored items.They sould also put the room in a corner or in a less populated area of the library.There should also have to have a sign saying there are sencorhip items in that room and, maybe a sign saying @NUM1 and older.     So there are many other was to dealing with censored items.Sence there are so many was to deal with them why take them out.We should not have to take censorship item out just becase some people do not like it.why punish every one becase of a few people"	3	3		3	3	3	3

Also, the material should be removed if it offend's their religion. Finally, it should be removed if it offend's their race.     The material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's gender. First, the material can make a person feel unworthy. Second, the material can cause an large altercation between the author and the person who is being offended and maybe others. Third, the material can also harm someone by them picking up the book and reading the text.     Also, the material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's religion.

4408	2	"Should books, music, movies, magazines, etc. be removed from libraries if they are found offensive? My opinion on this is no. In this essay I will explain my opinion and hopefully change other peoples opinions. I will also explain how the past has an effect on present day.       In some cases books, music, movies, magazines, etc. @MONTH1 offend any race or a sertain sex, but that is what happened in the history of the @LOCATION1. Some @MONTH1 be very offensive but it only shows a past, others @MONTH1 just be plain out racist or sexist. Those that show the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 history are an education sorce so we can learn from mistakes. Here is exactly why I state this opinion, taking this material off shelves is like taking someones freedom of speach away. I hate when I here music that disrespects women but im not going to try and get it taken away because it might just be expressing how the artist of the song loved someone or how history for their family @MONTH1 have been.     In conclusion, I believe this material should not be taken off the shelves. After explaining my opinion think about what is offensive or just someone expressing a past memory. If a past was offensive something tody might be offensive, as I was told earlier in my life treat others as you want to be treated. I hope i caught attention and changed some opinions because alot of offence today has resulted from the past"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4410	2	"I belive that all literature of any kind is useful even though it could be offensive.  If society plans on taking something off the shelf because it offends a race or gender, than many life-lesson books, movies, magazines, music, etc., would be removed from the shelves.  Things such as books or movies are there to take people to different worlds, to help them learn knowledge, to teach them lessons that the real world @MONTH1 not teach them.  If materials are taken off the shelf in fear of offending someone, then not very many things will be left just like Katherine Paterson says in her quote.  If certian literature were not around anymore then it definitly would not be the same as it is now.  Literature are there for us, they teach us, and if if one @CAPS1 was taken away, it would start a riot.     Books are always there for us, when we are bored, lonely, or just want to escape reality.  Imagine if you we not able to read your favorite book because it was no longer considered appropriate for society.  If all books had to be appropriate for every age, it would take all the interesting out of everything.  Whether it is a novel or a regular encyclopedia, all books would be dulled down to exceed the needs of our 'non offending' society.  Lots of music would lose it's luster and magazines would not be able to gossip about the 'hottest new things.'  Movies would get too boring to watch and many things in society would fall apart.     Books, documentaries, magazines, are there to help people learn, either if its a lesson about what not to do while your young, such as smoking, if books about smoking were taken away because it offended the part of society that chose to smoke then how would any of the teens today know not to start smoking?  Novels are usually fiction, but the characters come to life to readers.  They have problems just life people of the real world even though they @MONTH1 not be real themsleves, so if one reads that book, the way that character handles the situation could help a real life person decide on what they should do about there problem.  Important history books of movies could be taken away becaus it 'offends' @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to have students learn about slaves.     If one @CAPS1 was taken from the shelf because of offending someone then more and more materials would be taken away form society.  What good does that do anyone?  It leaves many students uneducated about many things that they need to be educated about.  It would disrupt the order in libraries if books were being removed because of aproppriateness.  If books were being judged on appropriateness then many authors would not be able to write the novels and literature that they do now.  No good would come of removing anything from the shelves of libraries.     Books, movies, magazines, music, it is all too important to society, it keep us company, it teaches us, is makes life easier at times when the world wants to kick you while you are down.  If one person decided that a book was not appropriate then they can chose not to read it, but they should not decide to help remove that book from the shelves of libraries.  They would start a landslide of trouble that would effect everyone in the @LOCATION1 and maybe even across the globe.  Information of any kind is a good @CAPS1 no matter the content of it.  So removing any sort of material from our libraries is a horrible idea."	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
4413	2	"A @CAPS1 is a place for people of all ages to come and get a book, magazine, music, movies and much more. Libraries are a key essential to learning and helping those with reading skills. Studies show that reading will make you much smarter and able to understand and comprehend well. However, in my opinion, offensive reading, viewing or listening material does not belong in libraries, to some extent.     As I stated earlier, libraries are a place of learning and for developing skills. Books that are for 'adults' can be found in adult type stores or even at a regular local book store. Parents bring their children to the @CAPS1 to support their reading ability and to advance it. They don't want to have to worry about making sure their kids are not looking at anything bad.      A few years back, I herd about a teenage boy that would go into the @CAPS1 about once a week to look for movies that this parnents would not approve of. Later on that boy was caught and punished. If those kinds of movies were not there in the first place, his parents would not of had to worry about it. Almost everywhere you go and everything to see and hear has some type of wrong background to it. Parents should feel okay and worry-free when it comes to letting their kids do something as simple as going to the @CAPS1. This problem can be easily fixed with removing that issue.      I strongly believe that @CAPS1 material should be censored in the way that those who should not see it, can not see it. On the other hand, material such as religious or cultural learning items that people find offensive should not be taken off the shelves. Religious and cultural books, music, movies, and/or magazines are for those to learn. Form what I have seen, someone @MONTH1 want, for example, a book about @CAPS2 taken off the shelf because they are @CAPS3 and might not support their religious ways. I find this wrong because it is a free country that includes freedom of religion and they can't be denied informing others about that religion.     Libraries are a place to feel safe and relaxed. Everyone likes to sit in the @CAPS1 for hours and soak in a good novel. Material that is found offensive does not belong their, unless it is for real educational learning."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4414	2	"The subject of censorship in libraries has been brought upon many times. Censorship is a rule prohibiting the view of a book, music, movies, magazines, etc. This censorship is because of it's rating or the content in it is inapropriate for some viewers/readers. Of course, many people have their own opinions about this censorship in libraries, as do I.      I believe that censorship is a good idea in some cases. These cases being music, or movies. However, I don't believe censorship is a good idea in books. Children all over the world read books and as time goes on, our children are becoming more and more advanced and read on higher levels. This is where censorship comes into play. Libraries want to censor higher reading level books because these books include profanity, violence, sex, drugs, and any other aspect of adultry. I disagree with the censorship of these books because this is basically telling our children that they can't challenge themselves or they can't learn about certain things because of their age.      These books, in my opinion, can only help them. These books will help them learn about society, what's wrong and what's right, and will help them, grow as they get older. The higher reading level books help them understand words better, and also help them learn about literature and past times.      When I was in middle school, I was not an advanced reader by any means, but I did like to read occasionally. One day, I went to the library in search of a challenging book. The book I found was a book called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' by @PERSON1. This book was a fictional story taking place during the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3. As I put in my pin number to check out the book at the front desk, the librarian informed me that I couldn't check out the book because it was a young adult book, meaning 'too advanced' for me. She said I needed parent consent before I was able to check it out.     That night, I asked my parents about it and asked if I could read it. They said yes, mostly because they were so thrilled that I even wanted to read a book so challenging. The next day I got a note from home informing the librarian that I could read the book. I was so thrilled when I was finally able to check out the book and read it.      From my experience with the library censorship, I think that the best route to take is that if there is a parent/guardian who is over @NUM1, and they approve of the checking out of the book/magazine or whatever it @MONTH1 be, then the child or student is allowed to check out said book/magazine etc.     In conclusion, the censorship of books, magazines, etc. is an overall mediocre idea, with some exceptions. The rule of parent/guardian consent is the best route to take in my opinion.Of course, this subject will be argued for many years to come and many people will have their own opinions. Each side of the argument has valid points, but I think that it is imparative that we keep censorship out of books and keep our children learning and reading at their highest ability, no matter what the reading level is."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4416	2	"Is @CAPS1 Right?     Is @CAPS1 right to have censorship in libraries? This question could be answered in two very different opinions. Some people @MONTH1 want all censorship items out of public areas. On the other hand, there are people that @MONTH1 like to read this type of material. This is a very opinionated topic.     In my opinion, libraries are places I go to find a book to read, research, listen to music, rent movies, or relax while looking at a magazine. Libraries are puble areas and not everyone is going to agree. Everyone has their own favorite book or genre. I believe @CAPS1 is unjustiful to take away censorship in libraries because this @MONTH1 be ones favorite genre. Why do libraries need to limit their choice while noone else does? For example, many parents would love if all clothes stores would ban holes in jeans because they are to revealing. The stores don't. They do not ban holes in jeans because many teenage girls like holes in their jeans. American @CAPS2 is not going to band capris just because I do not like them. There are different favorites, likes, dislikes, and opinions.     A great resolution for this dissagreement is catorigizing. By putting all of the censorshiped books, movies, magazines, and music in one area, @CAPS1 will decrease arguments on this topic because all of the people that like censorship in libraries will be together in their area. Where as the people that do not want the censorship in libraries do not have to be around @CAPS1. This is a quick and easy fix.      There is no reason to take away ones favorite genre because someone doesn't like @CAPS1. If this is true then our world will have nothing because not everyone likes one certain thing. For instance, I do not like blue aeropostale shirts. Pink are my favorite. My friend @CAPS3 likes the blue shirts and hates the pink shirts. We both write to the manager to get rid of the shirt color we do not like. This is nonbenifical for either of us because now the one we do not like is got but so is the one we do like. This is nonsense. There will be nothing left in the store. Pople in charge can easily sort material at a store or a library to make @CAPS1 fit the communities likings. Getting rid of material is not the answer. Catorigizing is the fix that needs to be put into action immediatly"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4421	2	"Children are our future because when I am old they will be the ones who are caring for me, so for me censorship is big deal for me. It's a big deal not only because of how it will affect my children, but because it will affect me and what everybody else will be able to read. I agree that censorship is an importaint issue but to what extent should it be taken. People should have the right to read what they want to. They should also be allowed to find it in their local public libraries.     My veiw on censorship in public libraries is that most things should be allowed to stay on the book shelf. I can understand censorship to an extent, but taking books out of a public libraries makes it hard to chose where to draw the line. You don't want a book taken out just because it has a bad word in it. Just because some books are classics that everyone knows, does that mean that we shouldn't take that book out of a public library? I do beleive that some books should stay because adults don't want to be reading kids books they most likely want to be reading a more complex book.      I think their are some books that should stay out of the library though. A example is books that are extremly racist. These books should be kept far away from are children. This is needed because younger children might try to act out things they might hear or read because there are audio books and those would just make them say those things. This could cause them to get in trouble for things they don't understand yet.     There is things that you can do as an alterative to keep these things out of the hands of children. There is already one that is used in public libraries and it is seperateing the adutl books from the children books. You could also move these two sections to oppisite sides of the library. the books that are more explicit cold be put higher up such as on a top shelf. Most kids would not be able to reach as high as a adult.     These are my veiws and ideas on censorship in libraries. The ideas and veiws that I have are most likely different than most people. I thought that they were good ideas though. Ones such as seperate section for kids and adults. I thought my best one was puting the more explicit books up higher and moving the sections farther a part."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4422	2	"Books, music, movies, and magazines are all a form of expression. We have the freedom to @ORGANIZATION1 the way we feel or think, but can it be to graphic for some to read? I believe censorship in libraries are needed to protect the minds of children and people who are easily influenced by the thoughts of others.     Books are a major factor in expressing the way one feels about a topic from romance to horror. Many children like to read books or comic books that invovle a great deal of violence. Childrens mind's are like sponges, which means they soke up anything they read about and it has a great chance at influencing their functioning to everyday activities.      If you go into a music store you will find many different types of music from rap to blue grass. I've noticed in my school that a particular type of music that stands out is rap and the favorite artist is @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1. @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 has been known for rapping about drugs, sex, money, and violence. Many teens think that if their favorite artist can do all this why can't they? I've only listened to a few songs by @ORGANIZATION2 and in every song one of those four key topics comes up.      Like @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 the movie industry is starting to come out with more and more movies about drugs, sex, money, and violence. Many students in my school talk about the latest comedy movies like '@ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS1', '@CAPS2' ect. and how they turned their life into something like those movies when they go on @DATE1 or @DATE2 break. Movies like those are funny to watch but for someone who is easily influenced shouldn't be watching them.     Books, music, movies, and magazines, they surround us with their stories and thoughts of another human being. We do have the freedom and the right to @ORGANIZATION1 ourselves but we also have the right to take it away if we feel it is endangering the minds of others. I think censorship in a library from certain things is a good option in cleaning up a mind poisoning mess"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4429	2	"Do you find books you read offensive?  How about music, or magazines?  I sure don't.  I can't think of why someone would be offended about a book they chose to read.  If you sit back and think about it, there should be a low amout of reasons that someone should be offended by a book that is written for the general public.       I believe that it is possible for there to be books that have offensive words or actions in them, but unless they are directed towards the reader, or intentionally being used to offend someone then it is just a book.  A lot of books, especially ones on history, use language and actions that were used during that time.  They use them to show you and inform you on how things used to be and what it was like during the time.  Not very often, or that I have ever seen, do the authors make a book to just to put someone down.  I tend to see books just explaining things and using offensive words just to show how things were and to set a tone of the book.     Music on the other hand could be thought of as different.  Many people could take music in the wrong way.  A majority of offensive problems spawning from music come from the genre of rap.  Rappers tend to express themselves throughly, and in doing that often times use very offensive language.  I personally don't get botherd by the music, because they are usually refering to their own life and how things went with them.  Music can also be on the good side too.  When you get the calm and collective music, it tends to help people and can be used to help people relax.  Therefore music can be either way, but it mostly goes about who the person is and how they react to what they listen to.     Then you have magazines.  Personally I think they are the worst of all.  Magazines tend to go one way or the other.  They either put a person down and be completely negative towards them, or they are positive and say nothing but good about them.  One big problem with magazines is that they write down what they hear and what they want to hear, not always knowing the full story.  In that case they have a very high chance of being very offensive towards the person or group they are talking about.  Magazines always have a positive, but where there is a positive they have a harsh negative thing to put in with it.       In these regaurds, I believe that there is nothing wrong with a library.  There are always going to be negatives and positives, but libraries tend to stick with the positive side.  Plus if a book looks like it might end up being offensive towards you, then there is no one that can tell you that you can't just put it down and stop reading it.  With music, only get stuff that you like and if you are easily offended don't listen to that music.  Libraries just give you the opportunity to possibly get something you could enjoy.  There is no reason someone would not be able to refrain from going in and getting an offensive book. In saying this, it can go either way.  I don't believe there is anything worng with libraries censorship as long as you can use your own good judgement."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4434	2	"I do not believe that these types of books should be taken off of the shelves. Everybody has their likes and dislikes with music, books, movies, magazines, etc. If the reader does not like the book, then the reader will not continue reading the book. If the listener does not enjoy rap music, then they will stop listening and try to find a different kind of music. This topic is about personal opinion and choice. If it was me, then I would say yes to allowing censored materials. I like getting the full effect out of things. I wanna hear the rawness of a song or the anger of a character in a book. I don't want to read and see a bunch of little stars on a censored word. I want to see that word and feel its full effect.          I am actually reading the very controversial book '@CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1'. As you @MONTH1 know the author of this book is named @PERSON1. Another thing you @MONTH1 know is the use of the '@CAPS2-word'. This is a very controversial book because he doesn't call colored people black or colored, he calls them the '@CAPS2-word' throughout most of the book. Most people now think this is very racist. But back in @LOCATION1's time it was very commonly said and used in his society. It wasn't racist back in that time, I mean it still was but it wasn't as controversial as it is today. Now critics and some readers don't agree with this term and think the book should not be held in libraries or read at all for that fact. I have to disagree though. I understand why he used the word, it was a common word in his time. If you take that word away from the book, you lose some history of the old south.     People have the freedom of speech to say whatever they want to say, whether that be in written form or verbally said. I honestly say some of these censored words. Most of the time these words are said when I am angry at myself or another person. People can't control what we say, so why should they be able to control what we write or sing? Just a thought. Saying that, on the other hand I can see why people don't want these censored words. Maybe they just don't want their little kid to say a censored word in class to the teacher or to another classmate. That's understandable, but you can't protect your kids from censored words. They are everywhere. From video games, to movies, and even most books now. You cannot control what other people do or say. It is their freedom to do whatever they want."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4440	2	"Imagine a world where nearly every other book is banned for some reason or another. That world is not a world I want to live in. I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong. For three reasons, really, the first being that people have the right to any information that they desire to have. The second, people do not have the power to take opportunities away from other people. The last point I will make is that no information is bad information.     Because we are in @LOCATION1, I asume that we are talking about censorship in @CAPS1 libraries. If that is the case, then I think that it is unconstituitional to ban any book, or censor any material. Censoring books is like putting a blind fold on whoever is reading the material; they don't see it for what it really is, or for what the intended purpose is.     If the prompt does happen to be including foreign countries, then I think humans do not have the right to influence what other people read. This is idealistic, yes, and in a perfect world, all countires would have equal rights for everyone, regardless of race or gender. I think that people should see everything the way it is. If something is offensive, it's offensive. It's the person's choice whether or not they read or listen.     That leads me to my last point, that no information can be bad information. Whether it is profane, or offensive in any way, there is always some kind of meaning behind it. From rappers like @PERSON2 and @CAPS2 @CAPS3, who I've found all of their songs have meaning, whether it's personal, or they are trying to send a message out to the people. There are books like @CAPS4 for @LOCATION2, by @ORGANIZATION1, which has recently been banned by some school libraries because of graphic scenes. The people who banned the book fail to realize that the book is not about those scenes. There is a much deeper message about guilt and grief, and redemption beneath it. Another, more famous book that was banned from school libraries is The @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6, by @PERSON1, which is a coming of age story about a boy.      In conclusion, I don not think it is right to ban books or music from libraries. No one has the right to.There is always meaning within. The way an author writes a story or a piece of music always has meaning; they made the conscious decision to write it that way for a reason. By banning books, they are taking people's chances to grow and expand."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4448	2	"The last thing I would want my children seeing in a @CAPS1 is offensive material. a @CAPS1 is thought of as a learning zone. Somewhere for people to learn about new things and expand their knowldge. If there are dirty magazines, movies on sexuality, offensive music or inappropriate websites available to children it completely defeats the purpose of having a safe learning enviornment.      My opinion is that libraries should be used primarily for educational purposes. That means that there should be appropriate books and magazines that are also age appropriate. Computers are also a great resource but can contain many offensive material. My standpoint on this issue is that the computers in the @CAPS1 should be monitored. If someone wants to look up inappropraite images and websites, then they should do it on their own time, in the privacy of their own home. It should not be allowed in public where innocent children will be exposed to it. That isn't fair to the kids, and it isn't fair to the parents who have tried to protect them from that kind of suggestive material.     I'm sure that there are many people out there that would disagree with my proposal. However those @MONTH1 be the type of people who aren't morally structured as I, or those who don't have kids to look out for. Or perhaps they just aren't as concerned about the issue. They will argue that there is really no severe need for the computers to be monitored, or that they have blocked websites. Yes, they @MONTH1 think that there is no real harm. But that @MONTH1 just be because that is the way they were raised, causing them to think in that same respect. With the magazines, some @MONTH1 argue that children will be exposed to suggestive material sometime, so why not now? But if everyone were to start thinking like this all morals would be forgotten.      In some cases morality might not be the issue at all. In fact, religion might be the most important issue. A lot of people are religious and their particular religion @MONTH1 be against looking at suggestive and 'unholy' material. Parents will not want to walk into a @CAPS1 with their children and find them starting at images that go against what they believe in. They will think of it as losing their child's innocense. Having these things out in the open and accessable to kids and teenagers could unintentionally send a message to them that indulging in sexual activities is acceptable when according to their religion it is not.     When I was a little girl I remember going to the @CAPS1 often with my mother to pick out books for school. I distinctly remember seeing naughty magazines laying across a table as I was walking toward the children's section. My mother was appauled that they had those laying out in the open like that, and especially right next to where the children's books were. She complained to one of the librarians and asked that they please remove them. The librarian apologized and agreed that the placement of the magazines was a little out of line. Ever since then my mom has been a little sceptical and dreads going to that @CAPS1. I suppose that is why I am so involved in this issue and the reason for this informative article.     I did not write this to place blame on anyone or to judge people for their beliefs. On the contrary, the purpose for my writing this was to inform general public of these issues and to explain my side of the arguement. I don't see the reason of having these materials on hand at a @CAPS1 where almost anyone has access to them. I do not understand the need for them to be obtainable at a @CAPS1, or if there is a need at all. I'm hoping that by reading this I have opened the eyes of some concerned parents out there, or have at least made them aware of the matter. Thank you for your time.          Sincerely, @PERSON1"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4449	2	"How would you like it if someone took a book away from you, just because it had @CAPS1 language or nasty meaning? I mean of course there are certain books that should be censored, but in doing so you exclude @CAPS1 great novels from the past. These novels were acceptable back then. If you want to censor boks do so in your own library.     Personaly, I don't believe in the censorship of books. It the author meant to write the book that way then the writing should stay that exact way. Censoring destroys books and the learning curriculum of multiple students. You would censor a school book if it had @CAPS1 graphic text between its covers.     There are tons of books that have bad language and perverse ideas. These books were penned to educate our civilization. If you take away those books, then you will be harming our societies ability to learn. Books, I believe should not be offensive unless your a self-conscious person. Reading a book is a delightful experience, it shouldn't be marred by censorships.      In my personal experience, I have had no problem reading a exquisit novel that has @CAPS1 minor graphic details. I do not care if there is a explicit word in my reading. Albeit, @CAPS1 neive persons have it in there will to remove offensive articles, not for public good, but for personal gain. These offensive tactics are a disgrace to literature and culture. @CAPS1 of the books writen in today's world are far less explicit then before. Thus, we would be creating that unwanted barrier.     When the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 burned the @CAPS4 books, we almost lost a whole civilizations culture and literature. This should never happen to today's literature. If we censor the books in our libraries, then we will be loosing a certain aspect of our culture. The censorship of the articles of reading in our libraries should be kept to personal libraries and only to personal libraries. The libraries are public for a reason.      In conclusion, Censorship should not be placed in libraries because it disrupts the public literature. If the books were meant to be read that way, then so be it. We are not the destroyer of classic literature, and it should never come to that."	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
4450	2	"I do not belive that they should be takein off the shelfs beacuse @CAPS1 people still come to get that sort of stuff. @CAPS1 people say is not plite for little kids 'well keek your kids away from it then.'             @CAPS1 people dont like it and @CAPS1 people do. I am one of the people that like that kind of stuff, beacuse no one can tell us what we can and cant watch or say. It is our life if we wanna watch that kind of stuff or read about it we can.            Noone is telling people that they half to read it or even look at it. If you dont like it dont look at it. @CAPS2 kind of stuff should be off to the side where you know what your goin to look at and away from kids                       @CAPS2 shouldnt even be a problem. @CAPS2 is just people that think they are high class and think if you look at that or watch that or read that you are a dirt bag. That is there opinon.             In conclusion  I think if you dont read @CAPS2 stuff or watch @CAPS2 stuff you are trying to be something you are not. Trying to act better than every cause your to high class to read something like that.  We all get a laugh out of @CAPS2 kind of stuff."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4451	2	"In my opinion, books that @MONTH1 seem offensive to someone should be kept on the shelf. Meaning that people should be allowed to check them out in the library and read them even if some people think those books in particular are offensive, or @MONTH1 come off as offensive.      A person should be able to read an article without feeling like somone wrote that book, article, or magazine to be offensive. Yes, but at the same time it is up to you, the reader, to pick a book that does and will not make you feel uncomfortable. Do not pick a book to read that discriminates against football players if you are a football player, because most likely it is going to upset you, or make you uncomfortable. Well say you want to read a book that discriminates against football players, and it does make you feel uncomfortable, do not take the book, and go complain to someone about how the book, or article makes you feel if you picked it out to begin with. If it makes you uncomfortable, put the book, or article down. No one is forcing you to read it or look at it.      People should be allowed to read whatever type of books they would like, and about anything that interests them. Just because an article, or book is offensive to you, does not mean it is offensive to other people. If we were to take all the books, articles, magazines off the shelfs of library's there would not be any books left for us to read because every book written offends at least one person.      Movies are a whole other issue in itself. There are many types of movies, and within those types of movies are types of things people do in the movies to make it funny, scary, shocking, stupid, etc. If you do not cuss and say you go watch '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' you are going to find it offensive because every other word they say is a cuss word. If you do not like @CAPS4 people jump out of strange places and scare the crap out of you, then you are not going to watch '@CAPS3.' @CAPS4 people find movies offensive or not to their liking the usually go and try to make a big deal out of it, and sue the people who made the movie. You doing that is causing more trouble than it is actually worth. The same thing with movies as books, if we were to take all the movies out of movie stores, and just stores in general that were offensive to at least one person in any way, we would not have any movies left to watch because at the end of the day; there are tons of movies that would offend some people, and make them uncomfortable.      In conclusion, if you find a movie, song, book, article, or magazine that is offensive to you, get over it. Keep that book or whatever it is out of your reach and in other peoples, because at the end of the day no one is going to help you sue an author, producer, or music production company because something they wrote, directed, or sung offends you. In my opinion you should just read what interests you, watch what you like, and listen to the songs you usually listen to"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4452	2	"Should books,music,magazines, etc., be removed form shelves that are found offensive? Everyone has their own oppion on that question. In my years of reading I have read a few books that were questionable. I wouldn't say someone else couldn't relate to it.      Personaly i don't think anything should be removed from the shelves. While growning up our parents try to keep us from things, at that point in life don't need to see. I can agree with age limit but you can't hide everything. Isn't it best to let the children know whats out there before you just letting them go to find out on there own?     You would probably get multiple answers to that question. My personal views @MONTH1 be different from the person sitting bestide me, but I think you should be able to have the right to read, see, and litsen to what you want. The world is not a safe place, its scary and mean to the people. When I raise my children, when they're younger there will be certin things that they wont know and wont see. But thats just part of raising your kids, when they get older and start asking quesions i'm going to answer with the truth.     Is keeping these things from our children lying to them? I would have to say yes to that question. By taking these things away from the youth we are telling them that its not out there, that the world is perfect and there is no wrong. Some people would actually say that, but I have to say to them that they haven't lived. Still to this day there is segregation to all people not just against races but in our own race itself.     To conclude my oppion I would have to say that we should be free to read and see what we want. We shouldn't, not let anyone see it and them and then let them out in the world, and have a complete culture shock. Teach your children whats out there, let them know the truth about the world. Should certain materials be removed from shelves? No, @CAPS1 is to judge what we see and hear?"	3	4		3	3	4	3																		
4454	2	Well people should be able to get whatever they want if there an adult kids should not but what can you do. It wouldnt be right to take away things that people like.	1	1		1	1	1	1																		
4458	2	"Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?  I understand that some parents wouldn't want their kids reading a book about drugs or watching a movie about gangs, but libraries shouldn't have to remove them from their shelves.  There is not one movie, book, or magazine where everyone will approve of it.  Just because a couple of people find it offensive doesn't mean they should have the power to determine what materials libraries have or don't have on their shelves.       One reason why I believe certain items shouldn't be removed from a library just because a couple of people find it offensive is because what Katherine Paterson said in her quote.  She is saying if there was a book a couple of parents didn't want their kids to see and they were to complain and have the right to remove it from the libraries shelf.  Then sooner or later, more and more parents will be coming in complaining about a different book, movie, or magazine every other day.  Soon, there wouldn't be any books, movies, magazines in the library.       Another reason why I believe we should have no say in what items libraries hold is this.  As you know, there is many different cultural familes living in the @LOCATION1.  Some people say bibles should be allowed in libraries.  Half the population agrees on that statement, the other half thinks that is ridiculous and they're thinking how they would even suggest doing such a thing.  How would a library handle this situation.  If we gave people the right to decide what was held in libraries.  There would be a group of people walking in there and saying they don't believe in @CAPS1 so they must take those bibles off the shelf before their children read it.  Then, as soon as the believers in @CAPS1 hear about it.  They would come to that library and complain about them actually taking that off the shelves.  There would be no way in pleasing everyone, so the libraries should be able to put whatever they want on their shelves.       My third and final reason why I think the public should have no say in this matter is if libraries were forced to take items off their shelves just because a couple people complain about certain books or movies.  Then why couldn't people do that at restaurants, or movie rental business, or outlet stores with clothes they don't approve.  If it was to happen to one business, then it should happen to every business and in my perspective.  The only person who should have the say in what they have in their store/library is the person who is paying for it and that is the owner.  It's their responsibility to know what's too far concerning movies or books, etc.  The public has to accept those choices.  You have to look at it from their view.  Would you want them to come into your business and start complaining and then you are forced to get rid of that item because of them.  It's just not the right way to handle things.     After reading all those opinions of mine, I would hope that you see where I'm coming from and you see that it just wouldn't be humane to do that.  It's never been that way and it should never be that way.  Obviously parents don't want their kids to see things inappropiate.  But it's not our say and we just have to face the fact that's the way it should be"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4459	2	"Today, we live in a world where there are many different political, religious and personal views; and with time, these views are only going to become more varied and more wide spread. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to cater to every single persons individual takes on the world. When it comes to libraries, it is even harder to have different books for all the different opinions that will not offend people with other opinions.    Let's take @LOCATION1 for example. There are many different races and people with different religions living here. This is a place that has already been through a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and has fought against racism and slavery. Although these are things that our country has overcome, there are still going to be arguments and disagreements over these problems. When there are different opinions, there are always going to be different books out there about the same topic from multiple points of view. As the readers of these books we need to know what point of view this is coming from and not choose a book that goes against our personal beliefs. This is where the offensiveness comes from. We live with many different people and we need to understand that not everyone is going to have the same views on life that we do.      When I was in eighth grade, I was @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 with some friends. One of them was pulling her eyes back (like someone would do if they were imitating an @CAPS3 person) because they were itchy. A very pregnant @CAPS3 @CAPS5 woman walked in and took offense to my friends eye movements. She yelled @CAPS6 us and said, 'I would have thought your parents raised you better than that.' @CAPS6 first, we did not understand what this woman was talking about until we realized that our friend had been pulling her eyes back. This showed us that different people can take offense to different things because of their heritage.     There is nothing we can do about the expanding cultures in our country. We cannot change the views of certain people in order to match those of our own beliefs nor can we change the fact that all the different people are going to voice their opinions and view them as 'right'. However, we can change the way that we view these people. We need to understand that there is no 'right' when you are dealing with multiple opinions. @CAPS6 this point we need to embrace everyone else for who they are and what they believe because there is nothing we can do to change those beliefs.     So next time you pick up a book @CAPS6 the library, read the summary and check to see that the author agrees with you before you take the book home or there are going to be disagreements in your views. If you get a book and you don't agree with it or if you are offended by it, there is no one to be mad @CAPS6 but yourself for not checking to see the author's stance on the topic before you started reading it"	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
4461	2	"Have you ever seen a book or magazine on a shelf that looked offensive? Say, maybe some sort of book that highly deals with drugs, alcohol or even sex? Well, some parents don't want their kids to 'accidently' pick up this book and read it. It could scar them mentally for life.      Offensive books are not meant for kids or even some kids in the early teens. They are too young to learn about drugs, alcohol and/or sex. If a kid picks up a book about sex, which I highly doubt would be on a library shelf, what would they say to their parents? '@CAPS1, look what I found.' is exactly what the kid would say and show the book to their parent. The parent, in shock, could sue the library for having such an offensive book.      However, some @CAPS2 do not find books like that on library shelves offensive. It might 'provide' good information for their lives or even someone else's life. @CAPS2 are the ones who should be reading those kinds of books, not their children. It can and will mentally scar them for life.       The library could do simple things, like for example: they could make a room just for @CAPS2 and have the offensive movies/books/magazines, ect in there. Kids can't enter unless they are @NUM1 or older. That could be a good idea because their children wouldn't be picking up those kinds of offensive books and it will keep their mind safer.      Us children are always curious to know things, especially when we are growing up. We'll ask about drugs, alcohol and even sex when the time is right. But for the library to have things like that on their shelves is just very offensive to parents and other @CAPS2. The library staff should take action and make a separate room for @CAPS2 @CAPS3"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4469	2	"Books in libraries are available to everyone, so who's job is it to decide which ones are appropriate and which are not? This is a very controversial topic. On one side, parents are worried about what their children have access to at local libraries. They believe libraries shouldn't contain any books that might be found offensive. On the other hand, whose job is it to decide what is offensive and what is not? If people are given the right to remove books that they think are not appropriate, eventually libraries will have so few books that it would be worthless to even get a library card.     I believe that it is the job of parents and other adults to teach a child morals and what is right and wrong. If kids have developed morals and values, parents wouldn't have to worry so much about what they're checking out of the local library. Kids are faced with issues of right and wrong everyday, and parents should learn to trust that their child is making the right decision.     As a teenager, I know that people have access to far worse things on the internet than in libraries. If people begin to censor libraries, surely they will begin to censor the internet, and the idea of freedom of speech will be thrown out the window. People have a right to be heard and share their opinions, and who has the right to say that a person's opinion doesn't matter? In my opinion, the act of removing books from a library says just that.      Just a few months ago I had to write a research paper about the @PERSON1, and in order to find information about the topic, I had to check out books from the library. Some of the information I read about the topic was horrible and very offensive, but I couldn't have written my paper without it. Books in libraries have information that is vital, whether the books are offensive or not. Books can be used to teach people lessons on what is right or wrong. By being educated about even the most offensive things, people can learn from them and form their beliefs. Removing offensive books from libraries will not lessen the chance that someone's child will run across the information that they contain. There are many sources for information, offensive or not, and a library is just one of them.      People are responsible for their decisions, and it is each individual's choice on what they choose to read, watch, or listen to. We are faced with choices everyday. Should we watch a movie even though we know it's inappropriate? Should we listen to a song even though it gives off a bad message? Checking out a book from the library requires the same decision. Each person must choose what is right, and it is not our job to tell others what they can and can't do."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4479	2	"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' wrote by Katherine Paterson. If you think about it when you go into a library there is a ton of books to choose from. But how many do you think is appropiate for every age and including children, not very many. That is why they have sections for the books, but there are times people are rude and mix them up on purpose.          How many times have you been in a library and find a misplaced book? Many of times right, that can be accidental or on purpose. I know if I took my child or children to a libraby and they got a book that was inappropiate for them, I would take it to the front desk and complain about that book. Now if it was a book that has been misplaced I would take it from them. But, yes there are some books, magazines, movies, and music that should be removed from the libray.      I remember from when I was a little girl going into the library to check out books with my mom or my dad, it did not matter they both enjoyed taking me to the library. They were pleased that I loved to read but, one day my mom took me to get books from the library, she did not think about looking at the books I got until we got home and she realized on of my books had a cursing word in it. She was not happy at all, I had no clue what she was doing. But I figured it out, she grabbed me by my hand and took me to the car. She fastened me in and off we went, back to the library. She had no problem going off and complaining, I can remember her every word she said it sounded like this. '@CAPS1, my name is @LOCATION2 and this is my daughter @PERSON2 she is six years old. We were just her about an hour ago, but you want to know the funny reason we are back. Well if you can give me a funny reason for why my six year old daughter has a childs book from here with cursing in it. Please speak up and explain I would love to hear it.' The lady at the front desk was stunned she has never had someone go off on her for the seven years she had worked there. But the book is no longer in the @LOCATION1 library, I can not remember the title of this book, I just know that with a mom like mine she can get something done.   Just like Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I can tell you from experience and observation, you can do and get what ever you want with a little power and persausion.

4482	2	"Books, music, movies, magazines, ect. should be remove if they are offensive to a race or any other kinds of belifs unless they are biogical or historical time line.  If the reading material is so offensive towards you or your belifs, you @MONTH1 want to see a libarian and tell what you think about so that the reading material will be remove off the sevles and gone.     I think that if it goes against something in a bad way is should be removed and gone.  I've read a magazine before and it had some offensive stuff.  I went to the libarian, told her that i wanted this magazine off the shelves.  We argued for about five minutes and finally the magazine was off the shelves.       Nobody wants something to go against them in anyway.  Thats way we should have offensive material off our libaries shelves."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4490	2	"Censorship can be considered as a major problem.  I believe it is our right to read and publish what we want. It should not be another person's opinion effecting what we can and cannot read, listen to, or even watch.  Lastly, censorship is a popular communist trend.  Therefore, I believe censorship is wrong.     First of all, we have a right to say, read, write, and watch what we want, as long as it is not slandering someone.  I don't believe that issue of slander is what is causing the censorship of many books today.  So, in any other case censorship would be wrong and immoral.     Second, it shouldn't be someone elses opinion that effects whether anything is censored.  My opinion @MONTH1 differ from another person's and their opinion @MONTH1 be way different from someone elses.  If they think it should be censored, they shouldn't read it themselves.  Others @MONTH1 find the book, movie, or magazine to be great and very informative or interesting.     Lastly, censorship is a communist trend.  Last I checked, the @LOCATION1 is a democracy.  So, it would be going back on our fundamentals of government to censor anything that isn't detrimental or slander to a person or race.     So, censorship shouldn't be allowed anywhere.  It is a very communist thing to do.  It infringes our rights.  Lastly, opinions are varied among people what should and should not be censored making it impossible to know what really should and shouldn't be censored"	3	3		3	3	4	3																		
4491	2	"Throughout history their have always been those who have refuted the beliefs and ideals of others. Whether that be in @LOCATION1 when statues were censored by removing anything deemed offensive by the @CAPS1 church or the mass burning of books to preserve ideals that could invalidated through the clear spoken text. However this in not the @DATE1, women are not looked down upon anymore, science is not dillouted, and ideas are free throughout the world with the internet. So is it the libraries fault for providing uncensored content or is the parents fault, for not educating their children on the morality of such items?     The modern library has very specific demographics for all items to which it posses. Movies over @CAPS2 attract both parents and teenagers alike, the music entices the teenagers, and the books and prior two media sources attract younger children. So how would it be fair to force a library to censor two of the things that earn the library the most money just so that kids don't read,watch or hear them. Plus libraries generally don't let young kids check out @CAPS3 rated movies or parental advisory @CAPS4.     Some people however argue that books are the most dangerous thing to children and young adults. As books can raise ideas and strengthen them in a teens mind over the course of @NUM1 pages till parents end up with an anti-sematic teen with bad view on racism. So then why would that be the fault of the library as it merely provided one book that should not have affected that teen so much, had that teen had solid moral beliefs instilled in him or her from their parents.     So if you find materials at a library offensive, or worry about your child going there, there's always an easy solution. Don't go their and don't let your child go their. However if you see the beauty in impurity that a library brings to a community and to a person as I do then don't allow the injustice to authors, songwriters, musicians, directors, and yourself occur."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4508	2	"I believe that censoring books in a library could be both good and bad.  I think that there is different levels of censorship that should be enforced depending on the library at which censorship is required.       In elementary school libraries, I think it would be appropriate to censor the books that are bought, and used in the library.  Seeing that elementary kids are not as mature as say an adult, or a high school student, their level of reading is not as advanced as ours.  Parents would definitely not want their children to be reading books that contain sex, drug usage, and any violence.  This is because reading these books might put ideas into their heads.  It @MONTH1 teach them things that they aren't supposed to do, and they @MONTH1 think that it is alright to act out on what they learn from a book.      On the other hand, high schoolers, such as myself, are interested in those kinds of books.  I am mature enough to know not to act out on what I read, and I am already aware of most of the things that books present.  While most guys are into violent books about shooting, or football books, a lot of girls are interested in the romance type of books, that possibly express more then what most kids should know.  In high schools, there should be less censory due to the fact that we are more mature and should be able to read what we are interested in.       In public libraries, I think there should be sections of books based on age level, which most libraries do have already.  This way parents taking their children to the library will know in which way they should direct them.  Everyone is obligated to their own choices, whether that choice is to read books that are more likely to be offensive, is their choice.      All in all, I don't think that books should be removed from the shelves if found offensive, because books are a type of out let to people.  They can be educational, read for entertainment, or just read to keep you preoccupied.  Books are everywhere, and people have every right to read whatever they please.  On the other hand, I think it is a great idea to censor books, and categorize them to reduce the chances of young children running into books they aren't supposed to, and to keep all of their parents happy!"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4514	2	"Should books be removed from shelves if they are offensive? Who would determine if something is offensive or not and to whom it offends? These are just two questions that can create a high level of conflict and issues among many people. Would removing books from shelves limit our possibility to learn or see something from a different point of view?      First of all, who decides what is offensive and who it offends? It is possible for anything to offend anyone.  Also removing a book from the shelves could be offensive to the writter and the followers of the writter. Bringing up removing a book from shelves could cause more problems then just letting the book remain on the shelves. If offending others is the issue then would it not be better to leave it alone over all, rather than making it an issue to please one group but inturn upsetting another?      Secondly, could removing a book from the shelves limit your ability to learn something or hear something from another point of view? If books that offended people would have always been removed for reasons of offending other we could not have much of the knowledge we have today. For example a biology book might be offensive to people whos religion explains things differently and would make things untrue, and a religous document such as 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3' could be offensive to the people who believe the biology books to be true. If we removed both types of books from the shelves for being offensive, we would not have religion or modern science. This example could be used for any topic or genre of book because people can take many different things as offensive.      As a solution,  I believe it true that it is not possible to please everyone. If one person is pleased another is offended. If that person is pleased then the first person is offended. If books could possibly labeled as'some might take offensive' or 'material @MONTH1 be offensive' then people have a warning and they can choose if they want to read it or not. If they are offended they can not put blame on the author or where ever they got the book because there was a warning. It would  be just like the parental warnings on cd's. This @MONTH1 not fix the problem of people being offended, but it could very much reduce the amount of complaints about a book being offensive.     In conclusion, books should just be left on the shelves regardless of people complaining about them being offensive. Books being taken off shelves could turn into all books being taken off shelves which means no education or learning. That is just not an opition. Leaving books that offend certain people on the shelves @MONTH1 cause contraversy with others but if some sort of warning could be put in place and the proper procedures are preformed, the issues should decrease greatly. Think about all this the next time you want a book to be removed from the shelves"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4527	2	"Today it seems as if anything you could imagine is out in the world somewhere, somehow. Whether it is found in a magazine, a book, music, or movies is irrelevant. The fact of the matter is, if good stuff is out there, then you can generally make the assumption that bad stuff is out there too. This bad stuff is sitting around on the shelves of our libraries nationwide waiting for someone to open it up and induldge in their naughty, intense, or graphic ways.      As an @CAPS1, every man has the right to do or read what he wants. But what happens if it is not a man at all but in fact it is a child? This child is not choosing to read such bad things but just so happens to stumble upon it. Should they be punished for accidentally coming across this material and reading it? Which raises the question; who is to blame, and, what is the solution? It is a good and respectable idea to censor certain things in libraries but if someone wants to read something, they should be able to right? It is a very sticky situation and determining the answer should be a long and thought out process examining the issue from all angles, and different perspectives.      The people that have brought this issue to the surface more than likely have personal experiences that make them feel so strongly on thier views of censorship in libraries, as have I. On a dry, blistering @DATE1 day I wanted to find something to do indoors. So instead of staying home all day I walked down to the library. I had been there a lot that @DATE1 and I was pretty familiar with their selection so I was looking for something new. So I strayed out of the kid section and browsed other areas of the library. There were so many choices and options right at the tip of my fingers. I got tired of reading all the titles so I did what generally any other kid would do, and something parents have been telling their kids for centuries not to do; I judged the books by their covers. I found one that looked interesting, and long story short I just so happened to stumble upon a love story. But not the kind I was used to. It was an adult book and want into vivid detail about the relationship of a sexually active older couple. Needless to say I was speechless. Reading that stuff as a child, scared mevery much so.     Nevertheless it leads me to believe that it would be smart for censorship to be put into place in libraries. Of course, not every kid is going to have the same experience I did. In fact hardly any will. But I know that I was traumatized. So I can easily imagine how other people felt when the same thing or a realitively similar thing happened to them. But for all the other people that have not had things happen to them or that have not stumbled upon such material would probably think that it is unfair that things should be taken away from them just because other people could not handle it. But if you were like me, or any other innocent child that happened to find and experience certain things they just were not ready for would you not agree that censoring libraries is a beneficial thing to everyone? If you want things that are more intense or out there, then you can go to a bookstore, instead of a public library.     I am a teenager and I do not have children but I can only imagine how you mothers and fathers out there would feel if it was their kids who were emotionally scarred from experiences they could have been shielded from in the first place. Kids should be kids and not have to be worried about the bad things in this world, and the most effiecient way to keep that the way it is, is to censor books, music, magazines and movies from the shelves of public libraries."	4	3		4	4	4	4

4531	2	"Book Censorship     Censorship in libraries are a major problem in the @LOCATION1. The question is, 'Should we have a age limit on what people can check out?' Or another question is, '@CAPS1 did they let my child check that out?' @CAPS2 are very commonly asked questions, and should have attention put toward them.     In my oponion, books should have a age limit on them. My reasoning is becuase, kids under @NUM1 years of age should have a place where they can find good books for thier age group. There are plently of books out there for all age groups. A kid under @NUM1, should not be able to check out a book, magazine, movie, or music that has offensive language, racial slurs, or dirty behivor from the character, or artist.      Another reason @CAPS1 libraries should have a age limit on things you can check out, is becuase kids can get the wrong idea. Lets say, a book has a statment in it that says '@CAPS3, I went to my bestfreind's house and drank alcohol.' @CAPS4 would be somthing that a child should not able able to read. It would give the child the wrong idea in what they 'could' be doing.     The age limits for book shelves should be as followed:@CAPS5 @NUM3 @NUM4 @NUM5 @NUM6 @NUM1-@CAPS6     @CAPS7 the books in @CAPS2 age groups would probably help stop the refrain on parents worrying about what their kid is reading. Plus, it would help the kid in deciding on what to read. I really think that @CAPS7 books in @CAPS2 age groups, will stop the commotion.     Censorship is a major problem in the @LOCATION1. With everything I have listed, I am pretty sure that the questions, 'Should we have a age limit on what people can check out?' and '@CAPS1 did they let my child check that out?' with be answered.

Also i can understand where the author is coming from but you would have to understand there is people oput there in the @LOCATION1 that would like to read or listen to unapropiate things that parent would not allow there children to see or listen to.I would also consider that @CAPS2, @CAPS1 dont let your child or children attend that library or that certain place where you know there is despictable materials there.Everyone has their own personal right to place there things where they want them to be.

4537	2	"Everybody had their favorite movie, song, or book when they were younger. Sometimes these types of media aren't exactly child friendly. Songs today hint at sexual activities. Books about scary vampires and werewolves are being published. There are even movies that depict violent and inappropriate behaviors in which children should not witness. Does that mean they should be limited by a public place, such as a library?  Several people would agree, but I disagree.          Growing up, @PERSON1 was the wonder of my world. Her music was fun and unbeat, making a sunny day even more enjoyable. Her lyrics seemed like they meant nothing, until you thought about it a little more deeply. Even looking at the music videos, they show actions and images little children shouldn't be copying. Some @MONTH1 restrict their child from such material, but I would call that depriving a child of there freedom.           You can go to any public library and look through numerous selections of books, dvd's, cd's, and even magazines. Some library's even have computers available to the public. Not all places will carry your favorite aritist, movies, or reading material tho because they believe it isn't something little children should be indulging in. Who is to say a little kid can't enjoy the material that they'd like? That's like taking away part of a person's originality. A child would not have the opportunity to become an individual with their own opinions and feelings if they were restricted to a one mind track.          Limiting a child's media could benefit them in some way. Restricting time on computers, limiting the amount of hours playing video games or watching television could help teach a child time managment skills. Most children will see something interesting and repeat what they learned or share it with an adult and it could get them into trouble. Library's shouldn't have to take the offensive media off the shelves though. Age restrictions on renting those offensive types of materials should be set.           Just because a book or movie has language and images that shouldn't be seen by children is made, does not mean a library should limit that access to the public. Restrictions on renting that material could be set. It would solve all issues, in my opinion. In conclusion, censorship in public library's could be beneficial, but they should just set an age renting limit instead of removing all material alltogether. Therefore, making parent's happier and not restricting a person's freedom to develop there own opinion's and liking's of the different types of media"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4543	2	"People @MONTH1 have a certain reason to take something off the shelves like books, magazines, @CAPS1, etc. Whether those reasons be personal or professional it rather important. Some @MONTH1 find the material offensive to themself. Others might find it inappropriate to have something like that available to the younger generation. And writing or music could be thought of as unneccessary and irrelevant.     The world holds many things that can be found offensive to someone. That someone could be an educated person or a high school dropout. Out of all of the stuff in the world someone is going to find something offensive to them or other people. It can be a phrase that an author uses or the name of a song. But to take something away from the people is not right and shouldn't be allowed unless it is highly offensive. They could choose to stay away from that sort of thing. Unless the offender is very public and offends pratically everyone, should it then be removed.     Other material could just be blatantly inappropriate for some to have access to. If there was a book on how to rob a bank or how to make cocaine then it should be removed because that would cause problems that could have never happened. People might learn how to do those things anyway but by allowing that to be public information would be like starting a fire that will get widely out of hand. Of course, anyone can get the notion to do something from anything they read but that is how they interpret it.     Some things out there are just inappropriate for the world and all the people on it. If you listen to a @CAPS2 and they singer or rapper starts using profanity and disrespecting a race or gender when they haven't done anything to anyone it would be unneccessary. Something like that should not be allowed in the first place and it is bad enough to be done to another singer but to talk about a race or culture in inexcusable. Or if a writer writes a story about someone, for example who just recently saved peoples lives, saying they were a horrible person and did terrible things to people when they only a little about the person and heard barely any of the story.     In conclusion, in certain instances the people should have the right to take away something that is extremely offensive not just to them but to a large amount of people.Or if the material can cause problems that should not have started. And if the writing or music is inappropriate to a race or culture should it be removed. Everyone has their rights and if writing, music, and videos are putting them down they should have the right for it to be taken from access."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4551	2	"This essay is about cenorship for the libarys well their shouldn't because alot of this stuff is on tv like comedy centreal, @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS3,mtv and alot of channels.     should music be cenorship no because the blanks can ruin the beats, rythem, and the lyrics. The cenorship ruins how the song goes and it makes people mad because they like a certain song but if they want to listen to it they have to get on a computer. Websites they can get on to listen to it is @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2, and alot more.     Movies shouldn't ethier its the parents pick if they didnt want the kids to watch or hear the things they do dont pick it or tell the kids to go to their rooms.     Books!!! should not i repeat should not be cenorship because what if the adults want to read them. That aint fair for them cause all of this is a about kids. Kids are smart about this they know what to read and what they shouldn't read.     T.V. shows! is best thing ever their alot of shows thats funny,awesome,thriller,and alot more. But its gets to you. Here a example @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS3, and more plays alot of good movies but since they have block out the words and parts of movie it really dont make sense to watch it because their not parts they really haved seen and they have to go rent it or buy it. To see the movie. Am i right?     All i am saying the cenorship ruins alot of tv shows movies and music and nobody wants that. It's ruins the enteriment for people and that sad to see cause actors, music writers, writers, and alot more speanded alot of their time for the fans and work. When they can be with their familys!!! Well this is the end of my essay"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4553	2	"Have you ever had a book, movie, or magazine offend you? Have you ever wished that no one else will ever have to read it? Should those offensive materials be removed from libraries? I don't think they should. The books, movies, and other materials should be marked saying that they @MONTH1 be found offensive.      From my own experience I know how easily one can be offended by a book or movie. Many times I have read a book that has completely contradicted my religion. Most times I will ignore it and move on to a better book or movie. Sometimes it is harder to ignore. I always try to forget and move forward with my life, as others should do.      Have you ever read the book The @CAPS1? If you have you are aware that there are some ideas in this book that bring up many controversies. One example from the book would be when they kill some of the children. Most people, like myself, do not agree with this idea. They think that it is wrong. Again some people @MONTH1 try to get this book banned, but it is still a wonderful literature.     As you @MONTH1 have seen in the media lately, many people are trying to get the book @CAPS2 @CAPS3 removed from schools. Some people have found the book as offensive because it repeatedly refers to native americans by a more profound word. The law has not passed yet and has remained in schools. The law hasnt passed because it does not affect everyone. Some people @MONTH1 not find this offensive. Therefore it was not removed.      Removing offensive books from libraries is the exact same thing. Some people @MONTH1 find the books offensive while others @MONTH1 not. Removing the books from everyone's reach would be appauling. The book @MONTH1 only be offensive to one race or religion. Why not simply put a warning label for that race or religion? That would take care of the problem by putting the decision of reading it and being offended in their hands. Possibly it isnt that the books are offensive to a race or religion, maybe it is to an age group. If that is the problem then the librarians can put those books in the appropriate age section.      I have given reasons from my own experiences, other readings, and my obersavations in the media. I only hope that you consider my ideas. Do not remove the books from the shelf only because it is offensive to one person. Simply put a warning label on the book after a few complaints. This would put the responsibility of being offended in thier hands. Once again I do not think that offensive materials should be removed from our libraries only censored to the people of whom it is offensive"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4556	2	"I do not think libraries should have to censor the kinds of books, magazines, etc..., because people should have the right to read anything that want.      People do not necessairly like reading some things, but if it is important that they research something, or read a book for school then they need to have the resources availablet to them. Take the book, @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2, for example. In that book it describes kidnapping, and the rape of young girls. Certain classes would require you to read this book, even though noone would really want to read about that.      Some people have different tastes in movies. Personally, I prefer horror movies (but not gory) because they get me thinking about whats going to happen next. Some people like the really graphic and gory movies, and maybe if the libraries started taking movies like this off the shelf, it would be harder for those people to find them.              Certain people would find some things more offensive than other people. Who can say where it should stop? Movies that make fun or talk about religion would be offensive to the people in that religion, but people from other religions would be un-effected by it. Just imagine watching @CAPS3 and seeing someone talk about everything you believe in and joking around about it. It would really offend people, while othre people couldn't care less.      Basically, I think we have the right to read or watch whatever makes us happy, and if there is something out there that you do not want to see, you just have to ignore it and leave it alone. It should not be ruined for other people who would like to see it"	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
4566	2	"REMOVING BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY BECAUSE THEY ARE OFFENSIVE IS A GOOD IDEA. I DO NOT AGREE BECAUSE, THE BOOKS SHOULD NOT BE GONE FOR GOOD. THERE SHOULD BE AGE LIMITS ON BOOKS. BOOKS THAT ARE OFFENSIVE SHOULD BE ONLY ALLOWED TO ADULTS OR A CERTAIN AGE GROUP, THIS WILL HELP WITH CHILDREN NOT BEING SCARED, TO HELP KEEP HISTORY AROUND AND, FREEDOM OF SPEECH.     BY MAKING AS AGE LIMIT ON CERTAIN BOOKS, WE CAN KEEP CHILDREN INACENT AND PURE. WITH BOOKS SUCH AS '@DATE1', KIDS @NUM1 OR UNDER SHOULD NOT READ THAT BOOK. @NUM1 AND UNDER ARE STILL NIEVE. LITTLE KIDS DO NOT KNOW ABOUT SEX OR EVEN PRE-MARRITAL SEX. WITH @PERSON1 AND IS GIRLFRIEND HAVING SEX EVERY OTHER CHAPTER, ITS VERY INAPPORITE FOR A CHILD TO READ. ALSO, WITH ALL THE TORTURE PARTS, IT WOULD SCARE A LITTLE BOY/GIRL OUT OF HIS/HER MIND.     WHEN GETTING RID OF OFFENSIVE BOOKS, WE REMOVE HISTORY. THINK ABOUT WHERE WE WOULD BE IF ANNE FRANK DID NOT WRITE HER DIARY. WE WOULD NOT KNOW HOW BAD HILTER REALLY WAS. WE COULD ONLY ASSUME. WITH GETTING RID OF BOOKS CAUSE THEY ARE 'OFFENSIVE' IS A RIDICULOUS REASON. BOOKS ARE ONLY OFFENSIVE TO SENATIVE PEOPLE. BOOKS KEEP HISTORY ALIVE! THINK: 'WHAT ARE WE WITHOUT HISTORY?'     FINALLY, FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS WHY THEY SHOULD SAY. AUTHORS HAVE THE RIGHT TO WRITE WHAT THEY WANT. IF THE READER DOES NOT LIKE IT AND FINDS IT OFFENSIVE, THEN THEY SHOULD NOT READ IT. IF SHAKE SPEARE, WAS TOLD HE COULD NOT WRITE HIS STORIES, WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE TRAGETY OF ROMEO AND JULIET. SO MANY BOOKS WOULD BE LOST IF SOMEONE COULD WRITE BECAUSE IT WAS OFFENSIVE.     BOOK THAT ARE TOO OFFENSIVE  OR INAPORITE FOR A CHILD TO READ THERE SHOULD BE A AGE LIMIT ON IT. IF WE GET RID OF CERTAIN BOOKS WE GET RID OF CERTAIN HISTORY AS WELL. GETTING RID OF THOSE BOOKS TELLS A NEXT COMING AUTHOR THAT FREEDOM OF SPEECH DOES NOT MATTER TO OFFENCIVENESS. SO KEEP THE BOOKS AROUND, ITS ONLY WORDS"	3	3		3	3	2	3																		
4575	2	"Censorship is a two sided question. There are people who believe that everything should be left the way that it is written. While other people believe that subjects that are offinisve should be removed. Is a subject too graphic for students? People have the freedom of speech. Knowledge is power. These are some reasons that can be thought about be for deciding if censoship is right or not.     What is too offinsive for a student to read? In history many things are considered offensive. If all the books that talk about history are gone then how will students be able to learn about the past. If students can't learn about the past than the past is bound it repeat itself. Other books like horror books are for entertainment purposes, so what is wrong with someone reading a book on a murder if its just for entertainment? There are books that must be kept so that students can learn to their full abilities.     If books are censored than that takes away a persons right to freedom of speech. That restricts somes creativity and since of wonder. If certain books are taken off the shelves of a library than books that are famous now @MONTH1 have never have been read. Books even if they are offensive can show someones thoughts and ideas that could have changed the world.     People everywhere learn from books. Books about the past help people understand what to do different for the future. Many things are learned from books everyday and if certain books are taken down there will be things that will never be learned, bacuse someone thought that the book was not appropriate for a student to read. Students read books about the past so that they learn. The past is the best teacher and when the past is gone there is no way for those students to learn about the past. Having books that are said to be offinsive can help in @MONTH1 ways.     All books should remain on the shelves. No matter what the book talks about a student can learn from that book. If the book is something that a student doesn't want to learn about than they don't  have to read the book. A lot can be learned from books and without books there can not and will not be knowledge that is spread for future generations to come."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4591	2	"All of the materials in a library shold have to be check out of the library before anyone can take them out of the library. Which the librarian should make sure that anything that goes out of the library should have to be checked out before a student can take the materials out of the library. the topics that are going to be talked about are: why materials have to be checked out of the library, what happens if you do not check out the materials, and what happens if you lose the materials that you check out of the library.     Materials that the library has is for everyone to check out if they want to check anything out of the library. So, then the librarian will be able to tell a student if they want a book, music, movie, magazine, ect., the librarian can tell the student if the material is in or is checked out of the library. Then, the student will be able to check out the material or can ask the librarian to hold the material when it comes back in for the student. Then, the whole school can be running smoothly senice the librarian can keep track of the materials that is in the library.     If you do not check out the materials that lis in the library nobody will be able to see where the materials are at. Which, if you checked out materials out of the library the librarian can track it down for you. So, if you do not check it out the librarian will not be able to track down any of the material that is in the library. So, then the librarian can not tell a student where the materials are at and then the materials is out of the library and noone can check it out. Then, the librarian has to wait til the person that took the materials out of the library brings the materials back to the library so that it will be able to be check out by the person that wanted it when it was out of the library.     If you check something out of the library and you lose it you will have to pay for it. When you lose something from the library, that means that noone will be able to check it out until it eithers gets returned or you have to pay the librarian the money for a new one. Then the next person that wanted it will have to wait even longer to get the lmaterials because you lost the libraries copy of the materials that you check out. Then the librarian will have to make sure that the next person that wanted the materials will be able to get it when ever it came back in the library. Then, the person that lost the material should not be able to check anything out of the library anymore thay can only sit in the library to reas the materials that they either want to read or have to read for a project for a grade for one of their classes. Also, if you do not check the materials out of the library, and you lose it the the librarian will not be able to track down the materials for anyon that wants it so the check it out.     These are just some of the many reasons why you have to check out materials from the library. There is alot more reasons you hve to check out materials from the library. So, then the librarian will be able to keep up with all of the materials that is in the library, and any person can check out any material that they either want or need for a class and it does not have to stay in the library when ever you want it"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4598	2	"To whom it @MONTH1 concern:          As time goes on in this ever-expanding world of ours, it seems that one thing that is constantly being fought and argued is censorship. Censorship allows things in our world that are viewed as 'offensive' to be comprimised.     People these days though. must be getting offended much more easily these days, because it seems that media is censored more than it ever has been. I for one, am sick of having the 'veil over the eyes' as it were. Most censorship in this country is run through programs our government has established, censorship shouldn't be up to a organization, but instead to the person viewing it. In other words, why should other people decide what is most pleasant for us to watch? Nobody knows you better than yourself, so why shouldn't you decide?      Why should censorship exsist in our media if it doesn't exsist in our everyday lives? There are plenty of things people see that they regret seeing, it's all in how you take it. No matter who it is, people are going to see things they don't want to see, that's just life.      Censorship denies our rights as @CAPS1 citizens to have the right for free speech. If you don't like something you're seeing, then look away yourself"	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
4605	2	"Hello I am kristin, I am here to tell you why we should take some magazines out of our public libraries. Now I dont know if you have heard about @CAPS1 the magazine or @CAPS2 magazine. But I have and I also use to read them. In some of thouse issues are sex tips.           Now if I was a mother and my child ran up to me beging me to let them cheek that thing out I would look at them and say no. They dont need to undestand sex untill they are in there teens or atleast thirteen or fourteen. A child shouldnt be able to even go near that area they should only be able to go near the children's section.           Some parents think like me and agree with the fact that a child shouldn't learn about sex. But others are like why not they are going to know about it in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and when they are married also.           There are also some other things that need out of a librarie. Some music might not be the best choice for a young child. Like for example rap music. It has allot of cussing in it and talking about sex. Some of the things said in a rap song are shorty let me rind you like a huricain. Thats just like saying hey chick lets do it for the heck of it. Thats not what I want my kid to listen to. I want my child to listen to stuff that says hey lets go outside and camp or duck duck gusse.              Some movies are okay to watch with your kids as long as its not over @NUM1. But if it is they can't watch it. I'll give you another example my little neice is probubly around the age of ten or so. She watche's @CAPS5 @CAPS6 but only with her parents inthe same room as her. She can not watch it by herself or she will get grounded.      This is why some of the stuff should be taken out of our public Libraries"	3	3		3	3	3	3

But I disagree, if they dont want to learn about that topic than don't read the book.          Public libraries are a great help for the community. They are reallly helpful for children who dont have certain materials at home. Libraries do think about what information children view. That is why there are restricted areas for children of certain age. Also its not always about what the library displays, but also about the parents who let their kids read things they are not supposed to read. If to some people some information is offensive, to others it might not. People will always have different points of view.           This materials cannot be removed, they might be important in some  points of our lifes. All information is helpful in some way.

4612	2	"In the book '@CAPS1 @NUM1', books are outlawed. In such a society, owning a book would result in recieving a punishment. Without books, @CAPS2 people turned to electronics for entertainment. The society as a whole had lost @CAPS2 human emotions and became submissive to the government. @CAPS4 led to injustices that the government inflicted upon its people because it didn't have any opposition. Katherine Paterson suggests that if books begin to be thrown out, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 people argue that certain media should be removed from libraries because they find it offensive. However, if every piece of media that was requested to be removed was taken out, @CAPS2 important works would be thrown away.     A recent debate has arisen over @PERSON1's 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS4 book is set in the @LOCATION3 during the time of slavery. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON4 befriends a black man, @PERSON6, and shares @CAPS2 experiences with him along the @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 decided to write his book using the true diction of the people who lived in the @LOCATION3 during @CAPS4 time period. He was the first author to do @CAPS4. Because he wrote it in @CAPS4 way, the book contains the n-word multiple times. @CAPS4 word is not acceptable today, and therefore @CAPS2 people take offense to his work. However, @CAPS4 book plays a major role in the @CAPS5 cannon. @PERSON1's work was written in a new and breakthrough method. If someone were to remove @CAPS4 work off of the shelves of libraries, he would remove one of the most important pieces of @CAPS5 literature.     '@ORGANIZATION2' by @PERSON3 is a book that explores the life of a convict in prison. During his time at @LOCATION2, he discovers that he is a homosexual. He falls in love with a man named @PERSON5 and begins to have sexual relationships with @CAPS2 of the men in his cell. These relationships are described in detail. If one were to read the surface of the book, he would find a crude description of a convict's experience in prison. However, @CAPS4 is not the case. @PERSON3 struggled with the concept of being bisexual throughout his life. He also had problems with his parents and brother. In '@PERSON2', he wrote about his own feelings through his characters. @CAPS4 story is not about sex, but about feelings of entrapment and the relationships one has with other people. If @CAPS4 book were to be removed from libraries, @CAPS2 people would miss a story that they might connect with.     Katherine Paterson brings up an interesting question. What would happen if everyone could remove the books they dislike? The answer would be a society that is unable to share ideas, concerns, and experiences. Media helps to enlighten, persuade, and educate people about important issues. While some works @MONTH1 have offensive language, they also have a deeper meaning."	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
4615	2	"Communities have many different types of people that live in them. Certain groups of people find some things offensive while others find them totally nomal. Some of these things cause conflict. A library, for example, is one place you @MONTH1 find some of these conflicts.     Most libraries are open to the public. Therefore, many different groups of people will be sharing the material in the library such as books, movies, magazines, and music. Having many different kinds of people sharing this material, the libraries must try to have material to please everyone. This is where the conflict begins. While trying to please everyone, some people @MONTH1 find some of the material offensive. Now for the big question: Should material some find offensive be removed from the shelves all together?     The answer to this big question is no. Libraries must have many different kinds of materials in them to please everyone in the community. People are different and believe in different things. Just because one person finds some type of material offensive doesn't mean it is offensive to everyone. For example, things such as religion. Someone @MONTH1 find a book on a type of religion and find it very offensive, but others @MONTH1 strongly believe in that reigion. Just because one person takes it offensively, doesn't mean those who don't should have it taken away from them.     Libraries are for all kinds of people. Just because one person finds the material offensive, doesn't mean it should be taken away from everyone else. If libraries took any material that anyone found offensive in any way off the shelves, there would be no material left. People believe in different things. That is the way it always has been and more than likely, the way it will always be"	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
4617	2	"Everyone has found something offensive throughout their life. However, many people find different things offensive than others. There are many different topics that people are offended of whether it is race, religion,gender,etc.       If there is a book that you find offensive in a public library I do not think it should be removed. It is like removing something just because one person does not like it. That would not be fair to everyone else that goes to that library. It @MONTH1 be offensive to you but to another person it @MONTH1 not be. There are many reasons that book could be in the library. It could help someone write a paper, to learn about a subject, or do some research on a topic. If all the books, music, magazines,movies or any other item in a library was to be removed if one person found it offensive then there would hardly be any books at all left in the library.      I think all books should be kept in the library even if one person finds its offensive. It could be offensive to them but not to someone else. If one person finds a book offensive and another person doesn't then it is not fair to the one that isn't offened to not be able to check it out.      If the concern is if children check it out what they might be learning from it then that would be the parents fault for not supervising what their children are checking out. The child @MONTH1 learn something new from the book.      Even if it is offensive you could still learn something from the book, movie,magazine, music, etc. If you still read the book it could help you change your mind on the topic. It @MONTH1 help other people change their mind by bringing new opinions about the topic to their mind that they have never thought of.      One condition on why a book,movie,magazine,music,etc would be removed would be if everyone agreed on it. If everyone that came to that library was offended by it then it @MONTH1 be in the library's best interest to get rid of that book.      The main idea here is that all books that are in the library should stay in the library. The author wrote it for a reason and it should be open to those who want to read it. If one person does not like it then they should simply not check the item out. If that was what happened everytime someone found something offensive in a library there would be hardly anything to check out. Even if it is offensive to you it could come in handy for another person"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4619	2	"Materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive! It's a public library. Not many people would like to find something that seems to hurt or harm them in any way.      Libraries are for people to come in and should be expected to enjoy something, whether it be a book, movie or magazine. When people come in looking for some good information about something, they look forward to finding good tips, and not being let down. Example, with something possibly about someone being racist. That's dissapointment to some. Noone should have to walk in and find something that offenses them. It's not fair.     Now, to parents with children. Would you like for your child going into a library that is allowed to look wherever their little heart desires, and they come upon porn or just anything that would be a bad influence on them? I highly doubt it. Unless, you just don't care about what your kid reads these days, but to the ones who want their child having a good education, well, you understand my statement.     It's just not fair to the ones who go to a library expected to be satisfied, but instead are let down. It does them no good, and it could make your community look bad. Libraries are to help people with information, fun facts, and all around good resources. So, please put the bad books, music, magazines, etc. away!"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4620	2	"I beleive censorship is a good thing; to an extent. I think that censorship deals with an age group and the permission of the parent(s) or guardian(s). If a consumer is the age of twelve and under; then the consumer should buy the censored books and etc., but, if you are thirteen and above you should be able to buy product uncensored.     Some people do not like censored products because they feel it takes away from that particular thing. Music, for example, alot of people get angry when the song lyrics on a @CAPS1 are censored. It does not allow the people to get the full effect of the music and the 'message' that the artist or band is sending.     With books; people get upset because they cannot get the full aspect of the book. Censoring a book is like taking away part of a masterpiece. Some books should be censored like alot of romance novels; those get pretty graphic and go into alot of detail with sexual themes and content. I do not think those books should be on the shelves.     In magazines; it depends on the type of magazine the consumer is reading. If a person is reading a politcal magazine; those magazines do not put all of the true facts and details into them for certain reasons. If a person is reading a hunting or fishing magazine; then they can put in all the facts on the guns, calls, lures, and stories they want and do not have to censor them.     Movies, on the other hand, are censored on certain channels. If you are watching a movie on a @CAPS2 network like @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS3; those channels censor movies. If you watch movies on @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS4 they do not censor the movies because those are movie channels only. That is also why movies have ratings. R is for restricted to people under seventeen (without an adult present) , @NUM1 is for people of the ages sixteen and under without an adult. and @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are fine for any age group.     All in all; censorship depends on what age group the consumer is in really. If you are still in elementary school you probably should not be able to buy uncensored products; if you are thirteen to about fifteen, you should be able to buy the product with permission from an adult, and if you are sixteen and older you should be able to buy the products uncensored with out an adult present because you know you can handle the 'offensive' matierial"	4	4		4	4	4	4

Movies in this time and age reveal to much for you eyes. For example in cartoons their are sexual content such as kissing .Some parents don't want their child expose to the kind of activity yet. Movies somtimes put false beliefs in peoples mind about the way things are, going to be,or the why you sould see it.Their are also some good movies place in libraries such ass docomentries, history , biography, and etc. Thats gives you good insite on how things was and hoe things are now.     Another topic is magazines. Its strange things going on in the world that @CAPS1 sould be aware of the why we put them in magazines but children have easy access to them in libraries. Picture that magzines have are images that sould be places in some magazines. As there are bad things there are also good that come from magazine. Magazines are in some ways just as useful as books. They carry very helpful information.     Music is aslo a big topic thats placed in libraries. Some of the lauguage thats is place on  cd tracks are good BUT  theirs alot of bad material that on them also. So many people out the known as @CAPS2 say some very harsh and profaine words that many and children sould just not want to hear. Like I said before as their is bad thier is much good. We have gospel , jazz, @CAPS3&@CAPS4, and etc that many people enjoy listing to.     In conclusion thier are many things good that belongs in libraries but also many bad. Libraries in my opinion sould take more caution on what people have access to. Very easy a young child (that can read) can pick up a adult book go sit in a corner read and be expose to most things parents are expose to. So in my opinion yes certin things should be removed from the shelves if the are found offensive."	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
4624	2	"Censorship in libraries is a very controversial topic that has conflicting views. One side, in favor of censorship, believes that some literary material contained within a library could be offensive to some, and that it should be removed or censored. The other side, in favor of free speech, believes that all literary material in a library should be kept, whether it is seen as offensive or not. Of these two sides of such a controversial issue, it is evident that censorship should not be instilled within libraries, because of the right to free speech, the true meanings and expressions must be upheld, and it would take the oppurtunity to read such a work truly from an interested reader.     The first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because of the right to free speech. This right belongs to all citizens of @LOCATION1, and shouldn't be taken away because one person @MONTH1 think something is offensive. I have observed that many people will often attempt to steal this right from people, and this instillation of censorship will do just that to the authors. This is the first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor.     The next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because this censorship @MONTH1 dull down the true meanings and expressive themes that literary works are meant to express. An example of a story that would suffer from censorship is the famous 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1.' Such a novel, though containing offensive language at times, would not read the same if such language was omitted and removed. Instead, @PERSON1's expressions within the story would be dulled down immensely and be nearly silenced. This is the next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor.     The last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because it removes the availability of the book from an interested reader. Many times I have seen people blatantly have a tantrum over an offensive literary work. I have been offended by things that I have read before, and instead of demanding its removal and crying for a less offensive substitute, I simply either stopped reading the work or read through it anyways. A person must know that the use of offensive language within literary works rarely is intended to attack the reader, but rather to strongly get a point across.  If a person finds the material too offensive to read, then they should simply stop and find a more suitable work. By remaining calm and passive about these things, it keeps the literary work on the shelves in its true form for other people who wish to read it.This is the last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor.     It is clearly evident that the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is a bad idea as a whole. The decision to censor literary works would be bad because it would strip the author's right to free speech, it would dull down the author's true meanings and expressions, and it would remove the oppurtunity to read such a work from an interested person. The removal or censorship of literary works would be a terrible decision that all would regret in the years to come. This is why the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is an unjust endeavor."	4	5		4	4	4	4																		
4626	2	"Reading is something people choose to do for their own entertainment, for their enjoyment,  to gain personal knowledge and many other reasons. Reading should not be restricted by any means. If a person has an interest in a book, they should be able to read it if they so choose. I believe that censorship within a library is not something that should be done.     For a person to be able to take away another persons right to read a book of his or her choice, is mind boggling. I know that some books can be pretty desciptive and graphic but these boundaries sould be set within a home. If a parent doesn't want their child reading a book don't take in out on the entire community. It's not fair to everyone else.     If you personally don't find entertainment or enjoyment out of a book that you consider offensive, there are many other alternative books to read. Nobody is forcing you to be miserable and read a book you don't like, that is why there are many sections in a library. The sections in a library range from mystery to romance, so find a different book and leave the offensive ones to people who like to read them. That way you are happy and so is everyone else.     Libraries are places people visit to check out and read books. Usually a person chooses a book because of the cover or a friend has requested you to read it. If libraries start to remove books from the shelves then there won't be any left for the rest of us to read. Not only will there be no more books but there also won't be anymore libraries for people to go to.     Just because a few people think that there are some offensive words, scenes and or other ideas in a book doesn't mean that it is right to take away the privilidge of another person to read it. If you have a problem with it, don't read it. It's that simple. Don't make other book readers suffer because of one persons opinion."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4627	2	"I do believe that certain books, music, movies, and other media should be removed from the shelves of libraries, if they are found to be offensive. We do not need anymore reasons for people to judge someone based on something that they read.     If the media is offensive, than someone's feelings will get hurt. I remember a time when I read a book, and it had some really offensive things about homeless people. I felt bad just for reading this, because it just made them sound like horrible people. Which in a lot of cases isn't true, but I remember people that read it and they believed of every word of it. Those people now rudely look down on them. So why would we allow this book to be in the library? This book changes the way many people think, and so do many more books.     There is a lot of offensive music too. Today most of the songs people listen to are, but we just don't realize it. These should not be available in a library, cause anybody could rent them. Which isn't good, cause they could really hurt someone's feelings by just singing a song they think is okay.     Another thing libraries need to watch are magazines. Most magazines are okay, but some like to throw in little inapproiate stories. So to really protect everyone and anyone they need to really go through the magizine and make sure its not offensive at all.     The media I think libraries really need to sit down and think over if they are okay, or not are definately movies. They need to realize that kids could rent these, and think are they apporiate. I think libraries should only have family oriented movies. This way nobody is harmed by anything they will veiw.      In conclusion, libraries should be extra careful in their media choices. They need to try and limit everything that is offensive, to try stop anybody from getting harmed"	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
4630	2	"Have you ever walked into a library and saw a book that you wouldn't what your child or any young one to pick up and read? There is several book in the library that young children should read. I don't believe that you a certian book should be removed from the library because it is offensive to some or not suitable for children, but there is a few things that can be done to keep those books away from your kids or any child. The possable things that could be done is; move those book to a higher shelf, designate a certian area for those books, or put an age limit on those books.     The first way that you could keep an offensive book out of your childs, or any other childs hands is to move those book to a higher shelf. Doing this will keep those books out of your childs sight and reach. That will keep them out of childens hand, and prevent them from reading them.     The next possability to keep offensive books out of your childs or any childs hand is to, designate a certain area for those books in the library. Doing this will provied a 'barrior', so that you could tell your child to stay out of that area, and keep a watch on them to make sure they don't go in that area. You would also know where those books are so the you could make sure they don't go to that area.     The final possability to keep offensive books out of your childs or any other childs hands is to put an age limit on those book to keep the children from being able to check-out those books, to read them. This would make the childen have be a certain age before the can check them out, preventing them from reading them.      These are a few possabilities that could be used to keep offisive books out of childrens hands, and preventing them from reading those offensive books that you wouldn't want them getting a hold of and reading"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4631	2	"Many people have different views on censorship. Some people believe there are movies, books, newspapers, etc that contain subject matter that is not appropriate for some viewers and that they should keep their writing on certain things to a certain extent or not at all. Other people believe people have the right to say what they want when they want, on a topic they believe the be true or not true, or very improtant to them, also called freedom of speech. Also people believe that yes, there are some things written out there that should not have been written but they have no control over and to some people it @MONTH1 be appropriate.      I do believe there are stories written that are not appropriate. But I know that even though I find the subject to not be appropriate or of any use to me, another person will. I know that every person out there is different and has their own beliefs on different things. If people had the power to control what books, magazines, newspapers and movies were in libraries then @PERSON1 was right, 'We would have no books left on the shelf for any of us'.           Certain books, newspapers, movies, and magazines could help certain people and be of interest to certain people no matter what the subject is or how inappropraite it @MONTH1 be as long as they are along the right age. If the story is plainly about drugs, sex, alcohol, and voilence with really no use to it, then yes I do believe it should be taken off the shelf. You do not know who could get their hands on that movie, book, or article. It could be a little kid and we do not want to open the door for that. People have many different beliefs and I do believe we should not take anything off the shelf that could be of use to anyone, but I also do believe there is a certain extent."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4648	2	"Some people believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. However, I do not believe they should be removed. People are mature enough to be able to handle offensive material. Most people check out books or movies that they have heard about, so for the most part they know what they are reading @MONTH1 be offensive. Instead of removing the ofensive material, there should just be a warning to let readers know that what they are checking out is considered offensive.           These days, people are mature enough to read offensive material. We see many types of offensive material every day. Examples of this inlcude when we watch the news, we @MONTH1 see numerous offensive pictures or videos. There are also many news stories that many people consider offensive. When a person checks out an offensive book, they are doing so because they want to. Libraries should not revoke a reader's right to read what he/she wants.           Before a person checks out a book or movie, they should look into it to make sure they are okay with what they are getting. This can prevent many problems. For example, say a young reader sees a book that they think looks interesting. If they don't read into it a little bit and just take it home, they @MONTH1 later find that it contains offensive material. However, if they read a little bit about it before they check it out, they will find out it contains offensive material, and can then make the decision on whether or not they still want to read it.           There are many ways libraries can prevent children or other people not mature enough to view the offensive material from seeing it. They can put a warning label on the book or movie to inform people that that particular item is considered offensive. Libraries could even put an age limit on checking out offensive material. Either of these ideas could be an efffective way to ensure that only mature people are checking out anything that is considered to be ofensive.     Libraries should not have to remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that contain offensive material from the shelves. If a person wants to check out a book that is offensive, they should be allowed to check it out and read it. Also, people should be intelligent enough to look into whatever item they are checking out before hand so they can be aware of the offensive material. However, to make things even easier, libraries could just put a warning label on offensive material to prevent some people from reading it."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4653	2	"Is there enough censorship in our libraries? Have you ever came across a vulgar or offensive book in your library and hoped that no children had ever read it? Well that should never happen,  if a book or any other material is offensive then it should be put in a seperate area of the library where only adults can access it. Other than that section their should not be any offensive or vulgar materials that children or even early teenagers should be able to see.      Almost everyday children and teenagers have access to offensive and vulgar materials that could have terrible effects on them. Maybe if they do not see these offensive materials when they are young they will be less likely to use or engage in some of the things that they see or read. For example when teenagers read about people doing drugs that could influence them to engage in those type of activities as well. The materials might not have an effect right away but later on down the road it could have a giant effect on them.     The youth is what is going to be running this country when we are old. So we need to do our part and take offensive and vulgar materials out of the reach of our children and teenagers. I do not want my children to read some of the things that I read when I was young. That is why I believe their should be censorship in every library."	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
4666	2	"When you walk into your local library there are thousands of books, magazines, movies, etc. You have different types and styles of books. There are fiction and nonfiction, comedy, horror, children books, and many more. Also what you might not know is some libraries have books that are either sexual, violent, disruptive, and aren't appropriate for young children. They could also have movies and magazines like that and that is not a good influence.     When a young child walks into a library, they would expect to find a book with color, action, pictures, etc. But while they're browsing around they could run into a certain book thats not meant for them and they could end up becoming influenced. A book that is inappropriate for a child could possibly affect a childs life because they could go out into reality and try to immitate a book they have read and it could end up being the wrong decision.     Inappropriate movie and magazines, such as pornagraphic magazines or pictures, rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 movies, shouldn't be allowed in a library. Items like that should be sold in a separate store. Items like these are meant for adults only. We should try to inspire our young children to do whats right and not try to convince them to do anything in a negative way. If you are going to have any of these items kept in your home, then keep them in a place where children can not find them.     The generation that we live in now, most young people only focus on gang violonce, sex, rap music, and drugs and you can find all of this material in movies, books, and songs. If we keep all of these negative minded items out of public places such as libraries and even homes, then there could possibly be some change. Most rap songs you hear these days are either talking about violence, sex, or drugs. Most music should have a positive message to it.      I feel if I see a book, movie, magazine, etc., sitting on a shelf where a young person can see it, I feel I should have the right to remove it because society is not like what it use to be and if we make a change like this, then I feel a few things can change. Eventhough I'm still young I feel my teenage generation should stop all the violence and stop becoming influenced by everything they see or hear, and if we focus on the more important things in life, then this world can be a whole different place."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4671	2	"I think that certain things in libraries should be taken off shelves if found offensive but not all. One of these things is anything that undermines or degrades one's religious beliefs. Another thing could be anything involving racial stereotypes or obvious racial comments. Having anything containing this could spark conflict within or outside of the library. Another thing that could be, but not entirely, removed from library material could be books that express violent or criminal acts. This type of material should only be given to an older audience.     I think that anything that contains slander or judgement on another person's religious beliefs should be removed from library shelves. As time goes on people are taking religion more and more serious. With that being said I don't think anyone would want to read a book or watch a movie in which the things they believe in being made fun of or rejected. It @MONTH1 not seem like harmful material at first glance, but your opinion @MONTH1 change when your customers come back angry and frustrated about what they read and saw. It would be a better choice to avoid this conflict with your customers and keep this material out of your library, unless you want to deal with complaints and costant arguments.     Another thing that needs to be removed is racial material. Racism has been one the worlds largest problems, it affects us all no matter who it's against. Picture a book in your library that calls all black teens a problem or a book that says all arabians dangerous, racist isn't it? Now imagine if your customers were of one of those two ethnicities, it's not a good picture at all. Keeping these stereotypes and harmful sayings off library shelves is a great business choice and will keep all customers happy. The last thing we want is for a customer to say 'those people are racist!'.     Lastly I think books that express violent and criminal acts should be censored from minors. Kids always follow what they hear or what they see. Since they're still in that stage where they rarely do things in their own way they @MONTH1 mimic or copy things they see. Another problem that surrounds this is peer pressure which will get more and more children commiting these acts. If this is to happen many parents will become outraged and blame the libraries for relaeasing this material to children. So the best choice would be to keep this material away from minors, if it is contained within your library"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4674	2	"Today, we all have a very large variety of books to choose from when we enter a library. Some are childrens books, while others are intended for a more mature reader. Many parents are scared that their child will read a book that @MONTH1 be inappropiate for their child. The thing is, if everyone removes the books that they don't find acceptable, there won't be any books left in the library for us to enjoy.     What makes a book unacceptable to read? Could it be language, graphic scenes, or parts that are just extremely scary? Many people think that books like these should not be available for anyone to read. Removing a book from a library would be done through one's opinion. This is not fair because we all have the right to free press, which means that anyone can publish anything they wish to and everyone has the right to read it. By removing books from a library, you are violating not only the author's right, but the reader's as well.      Unfourtunately, there are some books that @MONTH1 cause a child to become scared. When a child reads a book, it's harder for them to realize that they are just reading a book. Many children take in every word of a story and turn it into a reality. Not only can this scare a child, but it makes it extremely difficult to explain that what they read in the story is not true. As more and more of these books are released, the more likely it becomes that children will be reading these offensive stories.     I believe that removing books from a library based on opinion is wrong. I understand that leaving these types of books out for children to read could cause a problem, but libraries are usually set up in sections. For instance, there is a childrens section, a teen section, and an adult section. This helps kids remain in an area appropiate for their age. I think that if a parent is worried enough that their child will read an offensive book, then they should go with their child to the library when checking out books to read.     A public library is designed to accompany a vast variety of readers. There will always be certain books that some of us find offensive. Removing books from a library only decreases the number of books to choose from; and if that were to happen, there would eventually be no books left for anyone to enjoy."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4679	2	"In libraries there should be a control over what certain kind of books, magazines, or movies that children should be able to read.  For instance movies, are we going to go let a @NUM1 year watch a rated @CAPS1 movie much less let him/her watch a porn movie. No thats just plain wrong. That goes with magazines and books. Magazines have some images that aren't appropriate for the right age bracket that can easily pick it up and look at it.  Books as well kids have very imaginative minds, they @MONTH1 not have pictures in them but still kids know a little more than what we give them credit for.     Me, I would know this because as a little kid my brothers got a rated @CAPS1 film called '@CAPS3's @CAPS4'. After watching all @NUM2 of the films that were available at the time, I just could not look at a doll the same way again.  Whenever my mom would get rid of a doll she used to own some of them had eyes that would move. I always sat at one side of the car while the doll would be as far away from me aas possible.     To prevent other kids from experiencing what I did local libraries ought to create sections in the library where you've got your children section, the teen section, and the adult section. So then you can easily tell the kids to only go to either the teen section or the kids section.  This should be the way to organize the films and magazines as well.  I know some people wouldnt agree with my ideas but I have to ask them in return. Do you have any better ideas?     Now for getting rid of stuff in our library that can be offensive. I would say we keep it, our kids need to know our culture that way they can survive in it. They need to know that there are still racists out there even though society tries to cover it up.  There's no way there going to be able to keep other people's opinions from coming ears length of the @CAPS3.  If our children are to grow up maturley they need to experience or at least know what bullying is.  Maybe learn what an athiest is or find out on their own what a sexist is.  Some of it is inappropriat'e so i will agree that kids need to find this out at a certain age but you can't keep it out of their lives forever.  Thats why its best not to throw the books out that mention those sort of things."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4685	2	"Most modern day book, movies, music, etc. do a fairly good job of placing warning in the form of '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticks on their covers. But books from before this practice began to happen @MONTH1 be found more offensive then books today. Why? Well, that's because many books of the past use words that today are found offensive. But those books, movies, and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem. There are examples of how each catagory is in today's society.     Take the book 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', written by @PERSON1, for example. In that story, there are words that are used to describe people of that time.. Back when @PERSON1 wrote the book, it was perfectly fine to use those words on those people, but in today's modern world, that is a book that has been on the list for being banned. It is offensive to use that word on people today, so parent groups and others are trying to get that book pulled off of shelves in hopes of erasing what was done in the past. I don't believe that a book should be banned for it's content, but rather how well it teaches its reader through its words. If it can teach a student in a high school or college class about the history and the culture of that time, then it shouldn't be banned at all. It should be read.     Movies have a rating system for a reason. There are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience. People must be of a certain age to rent, buy, or view these kind of movies 'leagally'. Not too many people listen to that system, even though it has exsisted for years. A horror film is not suitable for a @CAPS15 of a young age who believes everything he or she sees on @CAPS4. Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives a @CAPS15 nightmares or makes them not as emotionally aware of what is right or wrong. That is the fault of the parents. They were the ones who let their @CAPS15 watch that movie in the first place. So the movie shouldn't be held responsible for the @CAPS15. If the movie was intended for a more mature audience, that's the way it should stay.     And that brings us to music. There is a lot of music in today's age that can be considered very offensive. There are only a few 'pure' genres, free of the cursing that is used in many of the others today. But children, teen, and adults all find their favorite kind, and you can't change their minds then. The governement has issued that all music containing harsh words, horrid images to the mind, gruesome scenes, and other elements that are offensive to people, must carry a sticker on it. The black and white '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticker. When parents see this sticker on the @CAPS7, @NUM1 download, or whatever their @CAPS15 is using, then they know that it is more than likely not right for their @CAPS15 to listen to. Doesn't mean that the parent is actually going to listen all the time, but it means that there is a slight chance that their minds will not be tainted by 'garbage'.     So, in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't neccessarily mean that it is the same to another person. There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep children from seeing them and to help with the level of harshness that is given to today's society. People will still argue that books such as 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON2', '@CAPS10 in the @CAPS11', and many, many more books like them should be banned. They will always fight that movies such as 'A @CAPS12 on @CAPS13 @CAPS14,' '@DATE1 the @NUM2', or '@CAPS15's @CAPS16' should be removed from store shelves because it gave them nightmares as a @CAPS19 or it gives their @CAPS15 nightmares because they saw it. And they will always try to fight and say that artist like @CAPS17' @CAPS18, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS19 @CAPS20 are not suited for their @CAPS15. Well, this pattern has been going on for years. Those books were made many years before, those movies are intended for a adult audience, not for a @CAPS15 of a young age, and those artists are just trying to make money like everyone else. So when parents try to argue about what should be on shelves and what should not, remember that it might be that parent's fault for letting their @CAPS15 view it in the first place."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4690	2	"Cencorship is a very large thing to talk about. Some people think that a book has too much talking about sex in it, while others think that it is sutable for the public. Sometimes people want other people to make the decitions on what they read. People need to decide what they do and don't want to read and see.      Firstly, people think that other people are incable of deciding for them selves what they want to read. They blocked books because they thought that it would show a side of things to children that they did not want them to see. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 books were block because they had witchcraft and they were scared that people were going to start trying to do it. Grapes of @CAPS3 was banded because their was slavery in it. Even though slavery was a big thing they still did not want any of the younger people to have it.      Secondly, some music and movies should be banned. Music has become a way for people to express them selves. Latily they have gotten to the point that drugs and 'hos' are alright to talk about. One song that I just saw was called @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Now if that is not sending a bad message than I don't know was is a good message. Movies are in the same boat as music. They are showing the violence that people only have in their head. @PERSON1 was a movie that off the top of my head was showing a minner that had gone completly blood thursty and was killing any one that went in his cave, just because he could.      Although, somethings we need to see the things that people have in @CAPS8 heads. I know that I am going to be more carful when I am out.      In conclution, @CAPS8 is no real yes or no anser. @CAPS8 is always exceptions to whatever people say. This is why people need to decide what they do and don't watch and read"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4694	2	"Do you think that certain materials should be removed off library's bookselfs if someone dislikes or does not agree with the topic or the plot? Do you believe that a book should be banned from any public library just because someone has a negative opinion about what the book is convincing readers?     I believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self. But if I have the right to remove that book from the self- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the self for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from the arthur, Katherine Paterson, from my opinion, I believe that what she is saying is very true. Considering that everyone has a different opinion on many things, if everyone had a right to remove one book that they did not like or felt it was offensive from the self, there would not be a varity of books for people to choose from. I have sometimes gotten corious about what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book. They either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible. Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good. So if they had the right to remove that book I would have never got the chance to read that book.     I do not believe that people should be able to remove books from shelfs just on their specific personality. Everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books. Everyone should get a large variety"	4	3		4	3	4	3

Books, books give a differnt form of lerning to differnt people.I personal don't learn from books as well as I do from the internet or tv but books are nice to have every once in a great while. Eeryone like to sit down and read a good book every once in a while.     Music doesn't really teach you anything, it relaxs you in differnt ways. Some people might learn from listening to music but i'm not one of those peole. It influnce you to get movited, say your getting ready for a football game and you want to get hyped up for it, well some music can get you hyped up for that game.     When i sit down and watch a movie I can learn from it cause i have the patien to sit down and watch it, to learn from it but that is just me other people have differnt ways of learning but the best way for me is to watch movies. They get stright to the point and don't waste time telling you stuff you alredy know.     Magazines are helpful to they have short artcicles that get stright to the point too, and that is what I like about magazines and movies. Even though there are very few magazines that give out helpful information, the ones that do help out alot.     So I think that music should be taken off shelves because they don't really teach you alot but books, movies, and magazine do help you to a certian point. It is up the other people to decide wether music should be taken off the shelves not just one person cause music might help other people in differnt ways not just one way but many ways too"	3	3		3	3	2	3																		
4701	2	"@CAPS1 are many prespectives on censorship in our country. Thats just how our country is we have different oppinions on everything we do. But we have to live with it, @CAPS1 are many different prespectives that come from old, young, parents, and children. In libraries @CAPS1 are some books,music, etc that @MONTH1 be offensive to people.     But we all have different oppinions therefore we can never listen to one pupil. Or it would start a fight between people that disagree with him/her. I think people that go into the library should be mature about what goes on in @CAPS1 otherwise they shouldn't be in @CAPS1 looking at whatever they are wanting to read about.          The library is opened for the public and has lots of knowledge it shares with us. But if we get rid of all the censorship then it denies people knowledge. The books that they would get rid of would be because of the children. Because parents don't want children to look @NUM1+ material that is not appropriate for them so they try to keep it hidden.     I think we should keep censorship around because it would deny knowledge to people if we did not keep it. And we should remind parents that some things in the library is not suitable for childrens eyes and let them be responsable for what thier children look at."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4702	2	"I do not think that a random stranger should have the right to decide what books to allow in a public library. If they have a problem with certain material in certiain books they should bring it to the attention of the library. The auther who wrote that book has the freedom of speech, and they are allowed to write anything that they would like to write. If somebody did not want their children looking at a book, or reading that book, then they should just tell their child to stay away from it, and if they raised their child properly, he or she should respect those boundries that the parents have set.     However, I think there should be a line drawn about what is too graphic to be displayed at a public library. Some magazines that contain graphic material are very educational, such as @ORGANIZATION1. On the other hand, I am not saying that we should be lining shelves with @CAPS1 magazines either. There is a difference between having books that educate children about other cultures, and those that educate them about sex and explicit material. It is the adults job to protect their children from material such as that. But they can do it in another way, other than taking the book off the shelf.     Even if the book is filled with drugs or nudity, the concerned parent cannot just take actions into their own hands. The owner of the library is the adult that gets to decide what types of books or magazines he or she allows in the library, not the customers. I think that if you are offended by a certain book at a library, you should bring it to the attention of the owner, or simply go to a different library. If the owner refuses to remove the item from the shelf and the material offends you that much, you could go to court and plead your case to the judge. But you have no right to remove a book from a shelf that does not belong to you."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4716	2	"Do you agree with me that we should be aloud to read, listen to or view what we want? I think it is unfair that the schools have the right to tell us what we can look at the right is ours this is america and we have the right to do what ever we want. I think we should have the choice to read it and if it is offensive then dont read it becuase it might be offensive to you but not everyone thinks it is volgare or rude and obsene.      I am asking you the paper to stick up with me and fight the school and tell them what they should be aloud to read because it is not right to censor good material just because some nut job does not like it.     That is all i am asking for is for you to stand up and back me up in this war on censorship."	2	2		2	3	2	3																		
4720	2	"I believe that profanity has a good side and a bad side. The good side is profanity is it give books, music, and movies taste and texteure it shows how a person feels most times it's anger. Profanity also can change a person behavior, by the way people talk and act. I personally think that profanity is a good and bad i like it in music and movies but i hate it when people talk trash. I think they should take it off the shelves depending on the person age for example age three and thirteen books should not contain profanity but ages fourteen and up can.           The reason why people should take it off the shelves is beacuse kids should have a healthy and profanity free life. They should have a a good development turds learning. Books and other intertaiment should have no profanity because kids at a young age learn easly and if they take in the bad actions of others they will be bad themselfs. The reason why people should be aware of this problem is if you don't like profanity dont buy it. Also keep out of kids reach. The main reason why people swears is because of movies and songs it changes a person dramaticly. Talking with profanity in your mouth can change your life but not having a good job getting in jail raising up bad kids that learn from the parents mistakes.      In a @CAPS1 profanity is good for movies it gives it action and drama. profanity is words that are most times negative expressing anger and rudeness. We have a @CAPS2 full of profanity this is like a wide spred deases. Passing on from people to kids to their kids. I have expeariance this the hard way beacuse im chinese and i came to the united states back in @DATE1, i did not know any english. People would cuss at me all the time the could all be avoided if we didnt have any profanity in our daily usage of books, music, and movies. I have learned alot about people by the way they talk letting me know who to stay away from. We should keep profanity but limit it from kids. Profanity is like ice cream people wants it and other dont. People could make there choice of putting themselfs in a profanity free life. people can do what they think is the right thing to do. Taking it off the shelves for kids is what i think is the right thing to do but not adults.     Due to profanity people tend to put themselfs in truble. For example some people in the use gets pulled over by a officer for a low cost speeding ticket but then they would swear at the officer putting them selfs in more truble this could all be avoided if he didnt have ever said anything. Profanity could also make a good motivational speech i know this beacuse im on the @LOCATION1 football team. Before every game our coach would motivate us by giving us a speech to get us pumped up with profanity in it. So in the end what im saying is porfanity should say but keep it out of reach of kids for books parents dont buy them if you dont want your kids to see them. Movies read the lable on the back of the @CAPS3 and see the agae limit and for profanity. Lock up the @ORGANIZATION1 shows that have profanity in it so your kids have no acess to them. If you dont want any part of profanity you can make yourself to stayway from it. We all know the there is nothing you can do about others useing profanity just dont use it yourself and stay clean do what you think is right"	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
4723	2	"When it comes to my idea of having censorship in the libraries around the world I believe that there are cases when there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that should not be on the shelves. Not only are there things in the books, etc. that children might not understand and take the wrong way, but there are also things that adults of any age might take offensivley as well.     In my years of being in school I have encountered many books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that I have thought should never even end up on the shelves of libraries. For one example, I was looking through the library one day for a book that I would be able to do my book report on, and just from reading the back of the book I learned that this book involved drugs, sex, and many other things that I thought would be inappropriate for someone even my age to read. For the librarians and other school workers involved in the buying of books, I am sure that they never even think twice about a book being offered to young children and teenagers that it would be inapropriate or offensive, but in almost all cases every single book has something that would prove them wrong.     Also I have encountered offensive behavior while reading a book that was said to be a wonderful book even for someone under the age of twelve. In my own experience from reading the book I would have to say that these people are crazy and should reevaluate the the specific age they market to. Not only are there books that I have found in the library to be inappropriate and offensive but also many magazines, movies, and music. There is usually not alot of music that would involve offensive behavior in libraries but in some cases there are. For example, I new someone that was doing a report on pop culture and while researching the music and listening to the music that the library provided, they found it to be very offensive and inappropriate for himself to hear. Other than that I have found that movies and magazines are just as bad as books when it comes to being offensive.     I myself would think that teenagers above the age of @NUM1 would understand the meaning of being mature. I have observed that most teenagers and even children that read offensive books end up having a behavior that most parents and teachers do not approve of. When it comes time for my children to reach this age I would hope that they would never act like some of the kids I have seen or spoken with.     After understanding how much inappropriate/offensive behavior there is in books, music, movies, magazines, etc., I not only recommend that they evaluate the type of books, and other resources that are offered in libraries, but also I have realized that I sure hope they get this matter taken care of right away. I not only feel that parents around the world would feel the same as I do, but I know for a fact that I would never want my children to read books that I have read or been offered through my high school library. This is a very serious matter that all teachers and parents should realize when they recommend books to children and even teenagers. The world is becomming more and more violent every single day, and it is up to the future children to solve this problem. In a sitaution like this, we do not want the minds of the youth to be infested with offensive and inappropriate behavior. Let this be a step in the right direction"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4724	2	"I belive that every one has thier right to thier own opinion.  If a parrent does not think that thier kid should do some thing dont let them. It kind of reminds me of how people are aginst hunting if you dont like it dont do it.     If every one would express thier own opinion the world would be alot better place.  If I dont like @PERSON1 and I tell @PERSON1 i dont like him @PERSON1 knows I dont like him so he wont talk to me any more.  So in a bigger picture if @LOCATION1 tells @LOCATION2 that we dont like thim they will not try to make friends with us any more.  so if everyone would speak thier mind the world would be alot better.     If a parent does not like some thing like a type of music, movie, or even book and they express that to thier kid they will learn that that thing is bad.  My dad tought me that it was fine to kill animals only if I am willing to eat them so that seams fine with me but other people might not think its right.  So I belive that if your not a hipocrite and live as you teach your kids to that your kids will listen to you.     As I have said before my dad tought me that its fine to kill animals if I am willing or going to eat them.  I find one exception to this rule cyotes (we have alot of cyotes where i live at and they can be a pest).  I belive that that is about the only exception to the rule because cyotes are problem animals in this area.     So if you dont want your kids watching rated @CAPS1 movies then block them on tv. Its the same thing with the other things like the magazines, books and music."	3	3		3	3	2	3																		
4726	2	"Every single person has there own beliefs and disbeliefs when it comes to books, music or anything in life for that matter. What @MONTH1 be a bad and vulgar book in our opinion @MONTH1 not be bad in others opinionated views. Everyone will have there own views about a book, music, movies, or magazines. That's why censorship is good in a public place like a library. Does that mean we're saying that you can't like what you want to like, listen to what you want to lisetn to, or watch what you want to watch in your own home? No, by censoring all that in public places like librarys or say video stores your helping fight a lot of trouble and concerns that could happen in the future.          Then again censoring movies, music, books, and magazines in a library could also be a bad thing. Not everyone is going to like the same things or be interested in all the same movies or books. At the same time though we can't censor every single thing someone doesn't like. By removing something because one parent has a complaint over their child watching, or reading a book they thought was too 'vulgar' then your giving that right to any parent that complains about their child doing that. It's not the librarys responsibility to watch over everyones child, to make sure they watch and read what their parents want them to. Kids will be kids and they'll do what they want to do.          By censoring and taking things off shelfs of librarys your not preventing them from watching a movie they shouldn't be seeing, or reading about book they're not supposed to be reading. Censoring librarys is just like censoring words in movies, by doing that it's not stopping your child from hearing or learing vulgar language. Children now in this day and age hear more vulgar words in school then they do in movies and television.       What does the word offensive really mean to a person? Everyone has their own opinion on whats offensive and whats not. Like i said, everyone has there own opinions and views on life and everything in it. You can't remove everything off the shelfs because one parent doesn't think it's right for their child or other children to be seeing, looking at, or listening to. We all have freedom to look at what we want and listen to the kind of music we feel like listening to. By taking things off the shelfs that maybe other people like oppose to others then your taking that right away as a @CAPS1 citizen. Censoring on some things like, sex scenes in movies, or maybe vulgar language in music is alright in my opinion. Taking books off the shelf because you don't like the way its written or you don't like the person who wrote it, or you don't like the kind of language the author decided to use in it isn't alright to me, you're pushing the limit on that one. Books teach kids things everyday, books give children imagination. By taking books off shelfs i think you're hurting a childs ability to grow.      Censoring is a good and bad thing. It could hurt children or it could help their ability to grow. Censoring some things are a good thing, but like i said not everything with vulgar language should be censored, or vulgar scences. Sometimes in order to grow and live in this world children need to read and see the things we as people but in books and movies"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4728	2	"I do not think that there is a need to remove offensive materials from libraries. Some people @MONTH1 find these things offensive, but I think that others will be greatly offended if they remove these things.      Take rap music for example. There are many people that think that the lyrics of those  songs are just terrible and offensive. Other people think that rap music is amazing. I do not think rap is very good at all, but I would not go the extent of saying that rap songs should not be played on the radio, and that the @CAPS1 should not be sold in stores. The same thing could be said for these materials in the library. Some @MONTH1 find them offensive but others greatly apreciate it.     Some people @MONTH1 be interested in these topics. Just like some people @MONTH1 be interested in fantasy or comedy. It would not be  fair for libraries to remove these materails from the library, and deny the people that do like them the rite to rent these materials.     Another factors is the maturity of the reader. If the person who is reading book or viewing movies that @MONTH1 be offensive is viewing them for clear interest then is no problem with it. But if the reader is not reading for interest, then there is a problem there. It all depends on the maturity that people have when they enter a library. The materials in libraries are there to give everyone a chance to find something that interests them. Just because someone else @MONTH1 find those materials offensive is no reasons to take them off the shelf.     I can see why some parents @MONTH1 be upset that their kids @MONTH1 see some of the things in the library that @MONTH1 not be apropriate, but all the libraries that I have been to have a had a special area for kids materials. If the parents where woried about their kids seing some the questionable materials they could bring the kid to that area.     I dont think that these materials that @MONTH1 seem offensive to some people should be removed from libraries. Everyone is going to be affended by something and it is not fare to deprive others of those materials even it is offensive to some."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4729	2	"Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. Libraries are given to people for new learning opportuites and for entertainment purposes. Everyone has their own likes and dislikes, not two peoples are the same.     First of all when a person goes to the library they should know that the books that are in there were selected by the owner of the library. Therefore it is their responsibility to put books into the library and take books out. What the owner of a library will try to do is to put a little bit of everything in it. What is ment by this statement is that there are so many differnt types of writting that people are bound to not like something. So that is why the owner will add a bit of everything into their library.      If someone has gotten a book that seems to be to their type of book, but after they start to read it they find it offensive to them they should not just throw the book out all together, but they should take it back to the library and talk to the owner about it. People have their rights to do what they want with a book, but if it is a book from the library then it technically is proporty of the library. So if someone gets offended with a book they should go talk to the owner let them know their concern, and try to have something done about it. In truth they will not be the only ones who have that oppionin. It takes one person to make the difference.      Books are not made for just one person they are made for many people to read and possibly enjoy. People have their oppininons and will stick by them. Thats expected to happen with books, they are all different as are people. The society that everyone lives in is filled with people of diverse oppions and who are not afraid of expressing them. There is nothing wrong with expressisng them eigther, actually its better that way only because then others can hear about a book and eigther agree with that oppionoin or disagree, therefore finding out what type of writing do they really like.      Books yes can be thrown out by rights, but the moment everyone starts doing that is the moment when everyone can no longer spread their oppionion. To spread an oppion is to let the world know wehre someone stands on a spacific topic. Without that the world would be just plain old boring having nothing to talk about because people would all share the same opinoin. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed for more reasons than one.                                       ~~@PERSON1"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4737	2	"I think that everyone has the right to hate or abhor cetian works but only the author of the work has the right to take it off of the shelf. The reason that just anyone can not take a work off the shelf is if the one person hates the work but everyone else likes it then imanenge how the people who like the work must feel when they hear it was distroyed.     Can you think of how the author of any work would feel if thousands of their works were being distroyed without any thought to others? I can and I feel horible just thinking about it so I belive that is the reason that only the creator of anything should make the disicion if their work should be saved or distroyed.     With these reasons that I have shaired with you please consider how everyone feels before you destroy anything if it is a book, movie, song, or even a childs dreams think about how thet would feel if anything of theirs was distroyed."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4740	2	"What @CAPS1 You Do?     A very big battle for a lot of people is if libraries should allow offensive matterial to be on their shelves. Some people don't care, but some people think it's a very big issue. For the people who care, their view on the issue is that the offensive matterial should be taken off of the library shelf. I personally believe that it should be ok for 'offensive' matterial to be on the shelves of the libraties across the @ORGANIZATION1.     What is conciterd offensive? Each and every person has their own view on what they think is offensive. An example is a young child @MONTH1 think that the word 'stupid' is a curse word while some older people think that it is not a curse word. If we did take off all the offensive matterial from the libraries, there @CAPS1 be nothing left. You @MONTH1 think that the @ORGANIZATION2 is a very good book, but if you talk to someone who believes the @ORGANIZATION2 is false, they @MONTH1 think that by having the @ORGANIZATION2 of the shelf is offensive to their own beliefs. Because so many people have a difforent view on what is offensive, no one @CAPS1 ever be able to actually have a non-offensive library. A group of people @CAPS1 not be able to agree on what is or what isn't offensive.      There are a lot of websites and organizations that say what they personally think is offensive and what is not. People can go to those websites and organizations to know what they personally should check out from the library. It should not be the libraries own job to say what you can and can not check out. Each person is responsible for their own actions. If a person wants to check out a book or movie that some people think is offensive, so be it. It is a free world. Some people @MONTH1 not aprove of their choice, but again, they have the right to read that book or listen to that music.     In conclusion I state: no one should be able to say what you can and can not have on the shelves of the library. If someone personally thinks that a movie or book is offensive, then they should not watch that movie or read that book. Really the question should not be, 'Should we remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from the library that are offensive?', the question should be, 'Should I be reading this book, watching this movie, or listening to this music?'. It is everyone's own choice to read a book or listen to a @LOCATION1. We are not accountable for what other people do. It is not the libraries own resonsiblility to be a mother to all of it's cusomers. Let the libraries be!"	4	4		4	4	4	4

WHEN SOMEONE WALKS INTO A LIBRARY NO ONE CAN TELL THEM WHAT TO GET THEY MAKE THAT DECISION THEMSELVES, SO WHEN A BOOK OFFENDS YOU MAYBE YOU SHOULD WRIGHT TO THE AUTHER AND TALK TO HIM\HER. ABOUT THEIR BOOK.  THINGS YOU COULD ACCOMPLISH BY WRIGHTING THE AUTHOR IS A LETTER IN THE MAIL STATEING THAT HE OR SHE IS SORRY FOR HURTING YOU WITH THEIR BOOK ,ANOTHER IS MAYBE A VISIT FROM THE AUTHOR IN PERSONSON TO TELL YOU THAT HE OR SHE IS SORRY FOR THE PAIN THAT HE OR SHE BOOK BROUGHT YOU. THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

4745	2	"'Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?' @CAPS1 these items should be taken off the shelves if found offensive.  First off, they should be removed because some people @MONTH1 be offended by them. Some @MONTH1 talk about race, religion or gender. Nobody wants to be criticized in a book or such. For example: rap music, all that is, is just people taking about what color they are or how big or small they are. Some people @MONTH1 be offended, and im sure no parent wants their child to be listening to that nonsense. So take them off the radio. Second off, if a child gets ahold of a criticizing book or movie or such that item can have a bad affect in the later future. They could start criticizing people for being different. Some books talk about religion, some people just cannot help their religion, they were born that way so they are familiar with it and do not want to change. No one should be judged for their religion, so take them off the shelves. Thirdly, my friend was watching a movie and it was about a female that liked the same sex, and in that movie they were making fun of her. No one should be judged by which sex they like. She was very offended. So take them off the shelves. Second to last, magazine authors take pictures of celebrities and down size them about three sizes smaller than what they really are and put them on the cover of fashion magazines or such. Why not just put that celebrity on there as the size they really are? Some @MONTH1 take offense to that. So just take pictures of celebrity and put them on the magazine as their real size or take them off the shelves. In conclusion,  in some of my observations and reading some people get offended quite often for being a different race, gender, or  religion.

4751	2	"I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves at a library if they could be found offensive. It is good to be unique, and no matter how innapropriate a subject might be, it is still factual and helpful in learning. If anything they should just put a label on the cover of the book that says somthing along the lines of 'adult content.' @CAPS1 repeats it's self, and this quote reminds me of periods in @CAPS1 where we need to learn from our mistakes, no matter how bad the subjects are, such as the @CAPS2, and the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the deep south.      What about the @CAPS2, when @NUM1 million @CAPS7 were killed because they were @CAPS7. @CAPS7 @MONTH1 find these books offensive but that doesn't mean the @CAPS2 never happened. There are many offensive and contraversial pictures and stories about events that happened during the @CAPS2. Even though this is a very depressing and horrific subject, it is still good for our @CAPS20 to learn about what happened. And other catagories need to be read because it can help @CAPS20 to understand right from wrong, and help prevent them from making big mistakes in the future.     The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 started from the @DATE1's all the way until @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @NUM2. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 took a toll on everyone in the @LOCATION1A, but some people couldn't handle it as well as others. In the south, most @CAPS19 treated @CAPS17 @CAPS18 as dirt. They didn't let them in their schools, in their clubs or churches, they were rude towards them, and most horrific of all, they lynched them. There were a set of @PERSON1 called the '@PERSON1,' which pretty much was a list of @PERSON1 to treat @CAPS25 as unfairly as possible. If a kid were to pick up a book or magazine with pictures of lynchings in them, they would remember it their whole life, and if that one picture truly bothered them, they their whole life growing up, they would realize that what @CAPS19 did to @CAPS25 was unethical.          Some books and magazines in libraries are really explicit, but we can't shelter our @CAPS20 their whole lives. Parents need to sit down with their @CAPS20 when they have questions and discuss the truth with them. What are parents going to do when their @CAPS20 go to school and hear other @CAPS20 talk about subjects such as sex? @CAPS20 could get the wrong idea about sex or not know exactly what it is because their parents never actually sat down and explained to them what sex is. I am not saying to go let your @NUM3 year old look at pictures of people having sex by any means, but when @CAPS20 get to a certain age, their parents need to step up and talk to them about uncomfortable subjects such as puberty, sex, and babies.     It is time parents stop hiding the truth from their @CAPS20, or hovering over their shoulders like helecoptors. If @CAPS20 don't learn the truth about the real @CAPS13 and about how many evil and manipulative people there are in the @CAPS13, when they go to college they won't be able to stand for themselves. If @CAPS20 don't learn about @CAPS1 and what all has been done, it is kind of like we are treating the books like the @CAPS7 and the @CAPS17 @CAPS18 were treated. Just because these books are different than others we will just get rid of them, just like how we tried to kill off all the @CAPS7 and @CAPS25 because they were different. And it is wrong and inhuman"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4754	2	"Do citizens have the right to remove books, magazines, and other materials from shelves because they personally do not agree with the content? Censorship in libraries is a subject with an unclear answer.  Some believe it is in their right to get rid of books, music, and movies with what they believe is 'offensive' material. Others think library censorship is wrong, that people should have access to whatever material they please. Censorship is simply a way of preventing knowledge from those who wish to learn more about worlds outside their own.     In @DATE1's society, there are no limits. The human imagination can create beautiful works of literary art and music, but it can also create material not suitable for every age group. Library censorship is a way to keep this 'unsuitable' material away from young and curious eyes. However, what @MONTH1 be unacceptable for children to view @MONTH1 be perfectly fine for a mature adult. Censorship is purely opinion. If a person is a strict believer that @CAPS1 created the world in seven days, they might find it offensive to see a book or a movie that supports the theory of evolution. If a parent does not want their child to watch @CAPS2, they would rather their children not see a @CAPS2 disk in the children's section for their child to see. If one person harbors a profound grudge against @CAPS4, it is unfair to others if all @CAPS5 content is removed from a library's shelves. If a person does not wish to have access to certain 'offensive' subjects, then they do not have to expose themselves to it. But it is not in their rights to remove it from the view of others who @MONTH1 wish to educate themselves on the said matters.     Writing is a form of self- expression, a method by which to convey feelings and thoughts and share them with others. It is also a way to teach and to inform others about the past. But if what is written is not shared, how can one form their own opinions and thoughts when they are not exposed to the opinions of those outside their community? It is unfair to prevent someone from learning about a certain subject simply because one or two other people oppose the content. If books and movies containing information unacceptable to one person were removed, then everyone else has the right to have material of their choice removed as well. Eventually, there would be nothing left because everyone is offended by one thing or another. That is one of the beauties of being an @CAPS6 citizen: freedom of speech. By living in @LOCATION1, one has the right to read or learn about whatever they please. Censorship prevents learning from those who want it.     Parents are possibly some of the biggest advocates of library censorship. Not wanting their children to be exposed to explicit or graphic material is understandable. But just because they do not want their child to see a movie about devil worship or the @CAPS7 era does not mean the parent has the right to prevent all others from seeing it. Children need to be exposed to these kinds of things at some point to encourage open- mindedness and acceptance of others. Libraries provide a source by which young people can educate themselves on the religions, beliefs, and customs of the outside world. It should not be up to the parents to decide what is put on the library shelves; if they do not want their children to have access to certain subjects, do not allow them to go to the library.      In conclusion, one can say library censorship is a matter of opinion. Citizens have a right to read, listen to, or watch whatever material they please. Granted, it is acceptable for parents to shield their children from certain subjects, but it is unaccepable for those same parents to prevent others in the community from learning. Freedom to express one's opinions in the form of literature means nothing if that literature cannot be shared with others. As Katherine Paterson once said, '... And then we have no bookes left of the shelf for any of us."	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
4760	2	"Certain books, magazines, music and movies should not be put on the shelves of a library. Children can learn rude or nasty things that their parents might not find alright for their child. There are some things that can be offensive in a library like prejudice books or music. Often music uses swearing language or states certain views on politics.     Libraries need to take control of this issue the right way. Getting rid of the material is not what should be done. Libraries need to keep better watch over certain sections of the library. They could do this by not letting children leave their parents side. That way parents can know and control what their children are seeing.     Then there is the issue of offending people. These problems could be resolved simply by putting up signs in different spots of the library. These sign could be in big bold letters stating 'Certain things in this section can be offending', '@CAPS1 control needed past this point'. Libraries should be more aware of how people feel about the way they are set up and presented to the public. Libraries should put them selves in the publics shoes, to see how they would like it if some of these things were showed to their children. Also, looking at things in a point of view of how some things could be offending, to fix the problems.     Once when I was in a library I was offended by a book title that was against my religion. After seeing that I thought if their were a sign or something around to warn me I would not of had to see that. Other things like this have occured in a library like one time my brother rented a movie my parents did not approve of. But with the way the libraries are set up and controled my brother was able to rent the movie and sneak it past my parents. Other children like my brother could do the same things only worse like look at an inappropiate magazine or read certain books that parents would not approve.     These types of occurances need to stop before something really bad happens. Libraries need to take control and show they know how to present things to the public in a proper manner. Actions that are happening in todays libraries are not alright. Putting up signs and requiring @CAPS1 control can reduce if not elliminate these unapproved occurances"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4774	2	"I do not think that materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removes from shelves if they are found offensive. I think this because people have different views and belifts on certains types of things, with reglion, culture, and sexaually. Some people can be defend by it but other might can be inform and learn new facts that they didn't already know.      People are not going to look at things the same. Eveyone has their own way of life and think differently. If one person feel the book was offensive to them then they would take it off the shelves. One by one people would find other materials offenive and what does it leave us. No more books, music, movies, and magazines.     Let face it everyone have different belifts, values, and purpose but taking a materials off the shelves because they found it offensive is ridulous to me. I say if they find it offensive don't read the book again or the magazine again. Feel offensive over a movie don't watch it again and the same as music don't listen to it again. Easy as that. Materials give us resources and we learn new things. If we didn't have materials like books, music, movies, and magazines we wouldn't be as smart as we is @CAPS1 are. American is about being free and have rhe right to speak our mind. So putting materials off of shelves is not the answer"	3	3		3	3	3	3

12028	5	"In the excerpt of Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives a memoir by @PERSON1 and internationally recognized clothing designer, there is a distinct mood of fond recollection of a warm and loving environment, as well as a greatfulness for the lessons learned in this environment. Narciso mentions how his parents created a home for him even though it meant making many, many sacrifices. He describes his @NUM1 – room apartment as a ""traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This quote is important because it begins the explanation of why his house gives him so many warm memories conveyed in his writing. Narciso explains how many people in his neighbor hood are immigrants that come together, help one another, and form one big family.  ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" Many people in his neighborhood joined Narciso's family for meals and this brought many of them closer. At the end of the memoir, Narciso explains how greatful he is that his parents gave up their lives in Cuba to give him a better chance in @LOCATION1 despite their hardships. This undeniable thankfulness is a large part of this memoir. "	4	3		4

12054	5	"The mood created by the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very uplifting and happy. One reason I think the memoir is uplifting and happy is because it talks about how greatful Narciso is of his parents. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will allways be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I thought that this line was very meaningful and uplifting because he's basicaly thanking his parents for immigrating and giving him a better life. Another reason I think this article is uplifting and happy is because in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with a blood relative."" I found that uplifting because essentially what he is saying that family doesn't allways mean who you are related to but the people around you that love and support you. Lastly this article is uplifting because it shows love can make a difference."	2	3		3																					
12058	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that it is lave. An example from the text says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families friends, and careers in the country they loved ."" @CAPS1 example from the text says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them my admiration for the strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" In conclusion because of his parents love for him they sacrificed alot, so he could have a happy and good life. "	3	3		3																					
12068	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. Narciso projects a very greatful, thankful + optimistic mood.

In paragraph six, Narciso says, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and it shows that Narciso is very greatful towards his parents, for bringing him to @LOCATION1, and him being who he is today, + who he was. Narciso also projected off a happy and thankful tone. He felt that his life was made so much better in @LOCATION1, than it wouldve or could've been in Cuba. Lastly, Narciso appears to be optimistic. Although he came from a little two-family home, he was still very hopeful about how his life would be better in @LOCATION1, and thanks his parents for their generous sacrifice.

12075	5	"The mood created in this memoir is comfort. To me it is so comforting because it is such a happy memoir, where these two young people invite other people over their house all the time. They also let people stay until they are able to get back on their feet. There is not one ounce of sadness to me, just a happy and inviting family which comforts me. Another thing is the lifestyle. I love how they are proud of their Cuban heritage. They listen to their Cuban music and always cook their Cuban food. I love it when people are not afraid to be themselves. It comforts me knowing everyone is happy. That is why the mood created in this memoir to me is comfort."	3	3		3																					
12082	5	"People make sacrafices for the ones they love. That is called being selfless. In the story, Narciso's parents are selfless.

He said he has ""learned the definition of 'family' "". His parents wanted a better life for him. They gave up a lot and he recognize that. Rodriguez realized his parents were very hardworking. He respected his parents and loved them for everything they have done for him. ""I often tell them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" It's a great feeling knowing someone will do anything for you.Family is very important. @PERSON1 mentioned how his neighbors were all immagrants. They had left their family, too; and only had eachother. Knowing you have people who are like family is incredible. Although they can never replace blood relatives, friends are the next best thing. I think growing up, @PERSON1 learned to very important lessons. Put others before yourself, and work hard."	3	3		3																					
12085	5	"The mood of this memoir created by the author is a grateful and/or thankfull mood. The mood is grateful because in the first several paragraphs it mentions how their home is not a high quality and they do not live a average middle class life but a severely lower-class life. However throughout the excerpt it is mentioned how whatever they lacked in quality they made up for with the coming together of their ""family"". By family it means how the other immigrants came together as one and helped one and another. Narciso mentions how even though his family had very little to share, they would always share all that they had to offer with anyone who needed it. By following this example mainly set by his parents he learned about life's lessons that he will never forget and is forever thankful and grateful to his parents for showing him."	3	2		3

Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly spanish, cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1""  In other words he is saying that he is lucky to have what he has, a ""family"". Being lucky for what you have also is a synonym for grateful, meaning that the mood of this memoir was grateful. He also said that his family kept an open door and open arms, showing that they would give some of what they had to other people, showing that they knew that others had less, and that they were grateful for what they had.

For example ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 I think another mood of the author is definitely love. I kno this because he talks about love and his family and friends alot. For example ""I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love.

12128	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain mood created by the other. This mood is a mix of many things. Love, generosity, and greatfulness. The Love feeling comes from the bond between friends and family. To them, family was your community and friends. They would let people stay at their house untill they got back on their feet, and often they would have many people join them for dinner.                                                                  The feeling of generosity comes from the selflessness the parents had for their kids, friends, and family. They would do kind things for them. They even immigrated from Cuba to have a better life for them and their children. The sence of greatfulness is from the friends and family, since the parents were so generous, people were greatful, and so was the author.

The mood in this memoir is created by the people and family who live there, and go there."	3	4		4																					
12129	5	The mood is very warm and welcoming. It starts off with a beautiful and culturally enriched apartment. Then talks about delicious foods and great music. But at the end it leaves off on a sadder tone of her parents leaving to make a better life.	1	2		2																					
12130	5	"The mood the author created in the memoir was calm, @CAPS1 saying ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" she gives off a calm relaxed feeling.

12131	5	"The mood  in the memoir could be many things the one that really stands out to me though is grateful. One way how @CAPS1 shows this is @CAPS1 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice @CAPS1 is so thankful that her parents brought her to @LOCATION1 so @CAPS1 could live a wonderful life.Another way @CAPS1 shows @CAPS1 is grateful is @CAPS1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 respects what her gone through to make her life enjoyable and not like what her parents lives were.The last way @CAPS1 shows gratefulness is @CAPS1 thanks her parents every day for what they have done. ""I've thanked them repeatedly"" @CAPS1 says in paragraph @NUM1. I don't think @CAPS1 could ever picture what her life would be like if her parents didn't do that for her. This is what I think the mood is in the memoir."	3	3		3

12157	5	"Happiness is the mood described in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez. Shown throughout the memoir that he is happy about the choice that his Parents had to make for him. The outcome of that is success. Also an example of one time the writer has shown happiness about his parents are the culture that he comes from showing that he is cuban and that he is proud to be what he is. As in the memoir says both his parents had come to america away from their good life to give more opportunities to their child. They had lost their Jobs and didn't know where to go, had no @CAPS1, But they were willing to do anything so it would benefit their child.

12162	5	"The memoir reflects the memories and traditions created in a Cuban family home.

His parents doors were always open to everyone. @CAPS1 is thankful for that and feels that @CAPS1 is lucky to have such a close knit community of friends and family.

That this family is filled with the most important thing needed to survive, @CAPS1."	2	1		2

For example, in paragraph @NUM1, the author writes, ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" the author tries to set the scene and give the reader a good sense of what growing up in his home was like.Also, the fact that they took relatives in and helped them get their lives back together again is comforting. In paragraph @NUM2, he writes, ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" the family knew that their family would do the same for them if they ever needed somewhere to stay.Finally, the amount of love and caring in the house is very strong.

This memoir gives you the feeling of appritiation because it makes you appritiate what you have and appritiate having any kind of family.

12230	5	"In this memoir, I think the mood created is very peaceful, happy, and homely. Narciso Rodriguez describes in detail how selfless his parent were, As the left their entire lifes behind in Cuba togive their Children a better life in @LOCATION1. Their home was almost a sanctuary. Warm, full of Cuban heritage, cooking and music. Family members always around, visiting frequently for dinner. A safe and secure place to grow up in, in my opinion. After reading this memoir I had a warm feeling inside of me, and I began to think of places like my home which make me feel in this way. Narciso was a very lucky boy to be brought up this way."	2	3		3																					
12233	5	"In the memoir, the author creates a very peaceful mood. He achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation.The author's voice is very blunt. for example, he describes his house as a ""simple house"" numerous times in the memoir. He tells the reader more than enough about his simple home, and there is almost no conflict in this memoir. This gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves the reader hanging or wondering about something.To help him with that, the author uses lots of unusual punctuation. Parenthesis are used five times in this writing, as well as five words with dashes. This punctuation is used to give extra information, like the age of ""twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria"" or about ""Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day)."" When the author gives extra information, it gives the reader a sense of peace and makes him feel ""at home"", which is the topic of the memoir."	3	2		3																					
12235	5	"In this memoir the mood that was created was security and warmth. I say this because throughout his story he talks about how grateful he is to have parents who cared about him so much they moved to the United States to give him a better life than what he would have had in Cuba. Narciso constantly talks about the food that his mom used to make and has taught him. The unity that the neighborhood has formed. When he was young there was still a lot of racism and segragation from whites to other races and because of that his neighborhood was the only place to feel at home and feel like they didn't have to prove anything. Their house was permanently open to whoever needed it, and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them. This memoir is about Narciso Rodriguez's kind and loving family, and that comes off strongly in his story."	2	3		3																					
12245	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our loves the author creates a mood in the memoir. The mood that he creates is a relaxed and laid-back mood.The way the author writes is very smooth for example ""in 1961 I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" That is a very relaxed sentence.He then goes on about his life. He tells about his neighborhood, family, religion and much more. Towards the end he tells what he is grateful for.The author told this story as if he was being interviewed and he was very relaxed and layed back."	1	1		1																					
12248	5	"The author of the memoir set a mood in the writting. The mood of thankfullness and humbleness was set in the writting piece. The word greatful was repeated over and over again. Since the author emphasized the word it gives a reader an idea that he truley is thankful for his parents and childhood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" this is an example of the author showing his graditude towards his parents. While reading this peice it gave me a warm feeling. Even though the author's parents had a hard time when they moved to @LOCATION1 they gave the author a good childhood with happy memories. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This is how the author looks at his memories. They are always cheerful and warm. In the last sentence of the memoir he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that he is grateful for having so many good relationships with lots of people and that it didn't matter how small their house was the author's parents help brought it to life, and for that he is grateful."	3	2		3																					
12251	5	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very thankfull and happy. Narciso does a very good job of show his moods, like when he says, ""Growing up in this environment it instilled me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" Here, you can tell that the mood is happy because the way he says how his family would welcome anyone into their family, but It also shows that if you grow up in a good family environment, you're also going to want to invest those lessons into your own kids lifes. Another example of mood is the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Not only does it show again that what you learn when you are little you always want for your family, but also shows that you cannot call a house a home till you are able to live their with your family and the home always have a good mood in it. In the end, the mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, reflects the proper, but not only way, to have a good mood in your home."	3	3		3

Love from the author's parents is shown again in paragraph @NUM1 when it says ""The faith that this struggle would leave them and their children to better living drove them to endure these hard times."" These two quotes show the love that the author's parents showed towards their children. A mood of hospitality was also shown in this memoir a lot. In paragraph @NUM3, it shows hospitality by saying ""it was a close-knit community of... immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows the hospitality of the neighborhood and how caring it was. The other mood that the author created in the memoir was gratitude in paragraph @NUM4, this is shown. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told him that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done.

It also talks about how a community that is going through the same strugles can come together and help each other out.

13021	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is love, happiness, and self lessness. The of the memoir that emphasized the mood of love was when the author mentioned that, ""It was here where I learned the true defonition of family. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" The mood for that exerpt was love because it explains how much he cared for his family and neighbors.

I think the memoir sets the mood family and friend because it talks alot about the meaning of family for example in paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" That means that even though someone is not blood related to you can love them just as much as if they were. @CAPS1 thing the memoir said was ""I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love.

13079	5	"While reading the memoir titled ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives by Narciso Rodriguez. I could feel the great sense of mood and emotion that the author poured into it. To describe the mood he created in this memoir, I would have to describe it as a great sense of love and gratitude for some things called home and family. This memoir is just gushing appreciation for family, parents, love, courage, and a caring home everywhere you look.Rodriguez starts off by describing his Cuban heritage and how it was always there during his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""My parents... Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."". Here you can really feel he appreciated how his parents incorporated his heritage into his daily life as a child and how he still has fond memories of those times. Rodriguez than goes on to discuss in paragraphs @NUM2 and @NUM3 the community he had grown up in and what he learned from being part of such a tight knit neighborhood, such as to open up your heart and home to those in need and to never hesitate when the people you care about need help. This is shown in para @NUM2, in two instances when he says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" And where it also says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship.""At the end of his memoir, Rodriguez then goes on to describe the love and appreciation he has for his parents for having ""Such courage"" and how ""They came selflessly"" (para, @NUM5) to @LOCATION1. In para @NUM6 it tells, ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" Rodriguez really tells of how their faithfulness and great examples have also helped shape him into the man he is today.To conclude, I truly need to say is that Rodriguez did a marvelous job with giving his memoir a very generous dosage of mood. It spoke volumes of how indebted he feels to his parents for giving him a loving home and teaching him how much family means, which I believe is the best gift a parent can give their child."	4	4		4																					
13083	5	"In the memoir, by Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author is togetherness. There are many other words to describe the mood, but togetherness describes the family as a whole. The parents accepted almost anybody into their home and they were very welcoming. To illustrate this, it says in the memoir, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" @CAPS1 could also describe the mood because the Rodriguez family let their neighbors and family to their table and they were very friendly. In the memoir it states, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table."" That quote also shows togetherness within the family. That the Rodriguez family stayed together through all the hard times of moving countries, getting new jobs, and starting over was really an accomplishment, especially in @LOCATION1. The memoir shows that, ""... My parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" @CAPS2, the family created the mood of togetherness, especially going through hard times."	3	4		4																					
13086	5	"Narciso Rodriguez sent a very loving and inviting mood to his memoir. He wrote about his great home and family. He showed how happy everyone was to be together and nothing went wrong. Narciso tells how his parents sacrificed everything in Cuba for him. The whole neighbor was tight-knit and loved each other. Family was defiantly a huge part of Narciso's life and he expressed that with his writing. His home was a ""traditional Cuban home"". By having his heritage surrounding him, his childhood was very pleasant. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our new home"". Narciso sets a loving mood with his great family and home memories."	3	2		3																					
13093	5	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author tries to create a mood that complements his opinion on the definition of family. Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a busy area of New Jersey filled with people of all nationalities. It was this melting pot of people and his parents hard work that shaped who he is today.                                                                                                     The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, exemplified best by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him. Narciso realizes the sacrifices and the the hard work his parents had to endure to provide for him, of which Narciso writes ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents were not selfish at all and took a huge endeavor by going for the United States. However, through their hard work, determination, and couage they established themselves in @LOCATION3. It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso's home, as he writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home."" (paragraph @NUM2) The use of the word ""warm"" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home. The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the the air with not just scent but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM3) The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood.                  Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community, of which the author write: ""Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM4) Despite the overt racism at the time, this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what. This unity with in the community definetely distills a happy mood within the reader. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very positive mood throughout the memoir."	4	4		4

It shows that the author had a very loving community and remembers this time as a time of love and brotherhood. Another example is when the author states ""...I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows the love he feels for his parents, his house and all the residents in the neighborhood.

Another reason @ORGANIZATION1 is greatful is for the love his parents give him because without his parents love and sacrifice he wouldn't have the courage he has. I know this because in the memoir @PERSON1 said ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.

The next reason @PERSON1 is greatful for his family because they are always there for him that is the reason his parents always keeps the door open to family. @PERSON1 is greatful for life and love.

He is a very grateful child. Another mood in the story was happiness, along with unity. Naciso quotes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Just by reading this quote you can clearly see that Narciso is very grateful.

Even though they gave these things up they brought along a lot of their Cuban customs with them such as music, cooking and lifestyle for Narciso to experience while living in the safe and comfortable environment of @LOCATION1. They took those things and invited them to their new house to create a comfortable, suitable, loving living area which allowed Narciso to call this area ""home"".

Another quote is, ""I've often told them that what they did was much more courageous than I could have ever done."" paragraph @NUM2 This shows that his parents must have done something very hard and gave up a lot to give him to have a good life.

One of the moods the author set was sympathetic or a sense of sympathy for the parents and how they only could live in a one-room furnished apartment. Another mood that was created was the mood of being proud. The author set this when they were talking about how he was born into a simple house and now he adored the music, culture, cooking and family. The author set a mood of sadness when he stated that it was a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. This creates a sad mood because of racism is a bad concept and also because the family is Cuban. Other moods that the author set were moods of gratetfulness and happiness. The author set a mood of gratefulness towards the end of the excerpt when he started saying how he is so thankful for having selfless parents and caring parents. Also when he said he had a humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just a scent and music but life and love. Happiness was the mood of the author because he lived in a good home, had a family full of love and care, and when he said I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."	4	4		4

In our neighborhood... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" that quote shows that the neighborhood and the people in it all contributed to the happy mood.

He also states ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This changes the mood to greatfulness and selflessness of the parents.

Narciso's family included the friends that he had made living in his neighborhood. Majority of Narciso's love went to his parents. He loved them for selflessly coming to @LOCATION1 just to give him a better life. They were fueled by the fact that they were giving a great life to their son, despite the fact that their jobs were not the best. He loved them for sacrificing their home, family, and friends back in Cuba just for him. Most of all, he loved them for teaching him two very important things-the spirit of generosity, and how important family and friends are.

13377	5	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he gives a mood throughout it. I think that if is that home is really where the heart lies and blooms. Paragraph two states, ""the congregation of family and friends... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.' In paragraph seven, 'It was in this simple house my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country.'

So those are the two moods that I think there are in the memoir. Also these are my thoughts on the memoir.	1	1		1																					
13389	5	"The mood of this memoir is the importance of family. @ORGANIZATION1 says in the beginning how much he loves his cuban culture and heritage.

Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" Narciso Rodriguez enjoyed his ethnicity very much. Him and his family were always very open and welcoming to other people.

Like when the author talked about their parents and the house they live in and how it always made them remember like if they were still there. So if I was in the author's shoe's I would fell good about how I was raised by my parents to live in a better place even if that means giving up a lot of thing that mean a lot to you. That is what I think the author's mood is.	2	1		2																					
13454	5	"The author created many feelings in the memoir. First, the author created a warm and loving mood; ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows how much passion is behind his families love and it makes you feel warm and comfortable inside. Second, some feelings the author also creates are friendly and caring; ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship."" This shows how friendship was very important and gives off a friendly and caring feeling to the reader.

13459	5	"In the story Narciso Rodriguez the mood of the auther created was very peaceful. It was saying how it was a traditional cuban home and there was passionate cuban music that filled the air. There was also the mixing of the aromas in the air coming from the kitchen. There's tons of loving people around the house too. Which makes it home and comfertable. The mood was always happy and everyone loved to cook so they would always do that together even though they wernt blood related. ""Within the walls, my young parents created created our traditional cuban home, every heart of it was in the kitchen. As you can tell this family loves being together and enjoys eachothers company"	3	2		3

He also liked how they would invite a lot of people to come over for a visit and how they treated them like family. He also likes how they tought him things that they know how to do such as cooking. His mood did seem to change when he talked about how in Cuba having a job was a bit eser then how it was in New Jersey. They tried to make as much as they could and his mood seemed to be a bit worried. His mood changed to be happy again when he menchened that he loves the way they treat their house like a real home."	3	2		3																					
13462	5	"The author creates a very happy, but curious mood towards the reader. The reading made me happy for Narciso, but curious on how much his parents had to struggle to give Narciso the best life he could get. For example the author states that his parents had to ""start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find."" Back in Cuba, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria (Narciso mom) had Studied chemical engineering."" This shows how much his parents lost due to immigrating to @LOCATION1. This made me wonder why they would do this. They did it because they wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also the author creates a sad emotion, by saying, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved."" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and @MONTH1 never see them again. The author creates a variety of different moods throught the memoir."	3	4		4																					
13464	5	"Based on a memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a specific mood is created.

This quote shows the passion the author has for his culture and traditions. Second, the author talks about the relationship he has with this neighborhood. A mood of passion is created based on the authors loving emotions towards his unofficial family. The author writes, ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family"" (paragraph @NUM2).

13466	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is comforting. His memoir shows his past life and how he felt about it. Cuban music filled the air, tables of Cuban feasts, different kinds of people interacting, all that is the mood he's trying to express about his life through his memoir. He's also showing his appreciation for his parent for making sacrafices for him so he could have more opportunities and education. He's also being very descriptive about his childhood and showing the type of life he had and what he and his parents had to go through when they came to @LOCATION1 and how they don't want people going through the same thing as them so they helped Immigrants who needed support."	2	2		2																					
13471	5	"In this memoir the author has created more than just one mood. He has, in my opinion, created around three. Love, gratitude, and carring.The mood of love was created because in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez tells us that family isn't just blood relatives. It can be anyone. In his case his whole neighbor hood was his family. Family can be anyone and to me family is or can be people that you love. That is how the mood of love was created by the author.When I read the memoir and got near the end, I personally felt the mood of gratitude. I felt that because the author is grateful for all the things his parents did for him, one example is when his parents left their hometown so that their son could have a better life. My parents did that for me, so I could relate on a personal level. I know I'm grateful for them making that big decision.I also think the mood of caring was created. I think that because in the memoir the author says that his parents would let people live with them until ""they got back on their feet."" I felt as if the family was caring doing that, its not like anyone would do that, so the family was caring. That is why I felt the mood caring was created by the author."	3	3		3

This story completely reminds me of him and since I have some background with this, I know this ""mood"" and it speaks to me. The memoir really shows, ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2."" a person coming here with close to nothing and become a very succesful person.

The different imigrants that live in the neighborhood that are very friendly and kind to one another and are hard working makes life there seem nice and easy going. I think how the parents give up everything like house, food, Cuba, and everything else in the gave up just for their kids to go to a good school, eat well, have friends, be near relatives and everything just to make their kids happy. That is a lot of work to have all of that especially in another country. Another happy thing they would do is with their lanlord they would set the table and eat good food and goof around and have fun.

""I was born into this simple house"" @CAPS1 says ""within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" @CAPS1 was very comfortable in his home and @CAPS1 loved it. It seems as thogh the excerpt was made to thank those who @CAPS1 lived with. As it says in paragraph @NUM1 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS2 the excerpt @CAPS1 explains how caring, and generous his family and neighbors were."" My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" The author tells about his neighbor making delicious meals all the time, and their dinner table consisted of many neighbors, and blood relatives.

13624	5	"The mood created in this memoir was manily for me family and Love. for most of the memoir the author was talking about exprens he had in the house, and the love he had's for his family and frend's. The first example I have for the mood is when he say's ""as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."". This shows the parents love for the kids. a second example I have is for family when the reading say's ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great senst that ""family"". and he is talking about thy are all so close nit.

13629	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood created by the author was loving, caring, and appreciative. loving is what they did most because they basicly called everyone thier family. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says that ""My parents always kept thier arms and thier door open to the many people we call family, knowing that they would do the same for us"". Another mood was caring, because they wanted thier children to have a better life. A example is ""My mother and father had to come to this country with such courage, to give thier children a better life, leaving thier friends, families, and career in the country they loved"". This shows they care about thier kids. One last mood is appreciative. ""The barriers to work were strong and high, my parents had to accept that they both might not be able to find the Jobs they deserve, they had to start thier life over. These are the moods that was created by the author."	3	4		4																					
8863	4	The author concludes the story with this because gardens cannot grow with snow on the ground. So she she figurers when all the snow is melted she”ll try to grow another one. I feel as if she wasn’t  happy enough to grow another garden I think she should be more interested in growin it then disappointed.    	0	0		0																					
8866	4	The author ended the story with this paragraph because it shows change. The snow is melting represents change from cold to warm. The geese returning represents a new life as in coming back to something semi–new. Just like the author is going back to drivers ed. The hibiscus is budding represents growth. The author will be older and more knolageble and more skilled than before.	1	2		2

8900	4	The reason the author of the story “Winter hibiscus” ends it the way she does is so that we know we can never give up. She fails her driving test the first time and me being less than a year from taking the test myself and no matter how many time I fail the test I will never give up. We need to preserve through every problem we go through in life. If we don’t and we just give up we will never get anything done in life. She vows in the spring and when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. I hope I pass my driving test the first time just like I did the learner’s permit test. Also you can’t give up on anything at all even something small like working if you stop working you will loose your job. Never give up.	1	2		2																					
8902	4	"The reason why the  author concludes the story with that paragraph is because it shows that saeng is starting to expect the new place she is in. Throughout  the story it says how she feels out of place just like the “ winter hibiscus”. Then later in the story she says how ,”many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become , through quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now .” That quote means that most things she thought of as strange she is now getting used to slowly, which means is adapting. So, the reason why she says the last paragraph is to show that when everything changes back to spring the geese come back, and the hibiscus is budding ,”then she will take that test again.”therefore  the author puts the conclusion on the story because it shows how  she will adapt as well as the hibiscus.

8903	4	"The writer leaves the reader with a sense of hope for the future by concluding with this paragraph. Even though the narrator buys the plant in sadness, after she fails her driving test and is missing her home, it is still a symbol of hope. She means that when the flower is blooming, her hope will be also and she will try again, maybe this time with success. Right now she @MONTH1 be sad and scary, but she knows that things will work out, and she will be fine. She is finally settling into her new life and says that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.” She means that even though she misses her homeland so much, she is slowly getting used to her new home, and her new life. And maybe by the spring she will be happy and comfortable here, comfortable enough to try her driving test again. The hibiscus represents both the longing for the past and the hope for the future."	3	2		3																					
8910	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the plant is noticed when she is coming home after felling the driving test. So she says when everything is right.

The driving test not important to her she won’t pas it though so she wants to go take it again when the plant she bought is budding and at its best point.	1	1		1																					
8911	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how much Saeng has grow because of this experience, and how determined she is. This last paragraph afters a sudden happy ending to a rather sad story, but gives the reader role knowing the mom character is confident enough to try again. The whole story was filled with sadness about Saeng’s family having to move to a new country and start all over. However, the one thing that acts as an escape for them, is their gardening. In Vietnam, they seemed to have a nice garden and enjoyed having with it very much. Now that their in @LOCATION2, their garden and the plants in it remind them of that homeland, and how there life used to be. Although saddened by not passing her driving test, Saeng finds a plant that makes her happy and seems to rejuvinate her how of passing the test. The final paragraph seals the deal, as it shows that she is again confident in herself because of the happy memories that she is thinking about."	3	2		3																					
8916	4	"The author concludes the story like that because she wants every body to know how she feels about the hibiscus. She felt like the hibiscus was a wondeful plant. She described it as ""smooth and cool toward the end of the first page. When she first the plant back in Vietnam she thought that is just grew wildly. Then when she saw it in the United States she was suprised that it grew in a pot.

She is telling you what she plants to do in the future so she refrencing from what she plans to do in the future she is keeping the behavior from before up so she says she will something again next year so that is why I said continus behavior. She said ‘’when they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this  hibiscus is buddin, then I will take that test again.

8923	4	"In 'Winter hibiscus' by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator never clearly indicates what test Saeng has failed. However, through subject matter and word choice it is clear that the test is not only important to Saeng and her mother, but also to her new life in @LOCATION1. Throughout the story saeng's longing for her homeland is over powering. The flood of memories that came back to her when she purchases the hibiscus, are obviously painful and part of her everyday life. Saeng is working is working hard to keep her memories of Vietnam alive, while knowing that she must learn to live the @CAPS2 customs and lifestyle. There are somethings she dosent need to change, like passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits alive, she can use them as motivation. This is why the last sentance of the story is so impowering, because she has learned to use the @NUM1 things together memory and change, ”when [] this hibiscus is budding I will take that test again”     "	3	2		3																					
8928	4	"I think the author finish the story with this paragraph for the following reasons. Saeng really means she will take the test in spring. I say that because she says when the snow melt and geese return meaning next spring she will take the test again. She is saying with confidence because she started to add more. For example, she added “hibiscus is budding.” Saeng is determined to past the test just by what she is saying. This is why it was the last paragraph and what she meant by it."	1	1		1																					
8938	4	I think that the author concludes which paragraph as his ending because thats what that is what the girl is going to be doing for the following year that is going to pass and still be with her mother helping her out in the garden. Without no friends just let in her mom	1	1		1																					
8943	4	The reason why the author concludes the story this way is because she wanted to leave the reader in suspence : wanting more. You can tell because it never really says what the test is. She wanted you to try and guess what the test is. When Saeng walked up to her mother she had told her that she failed the test.	1	1		1																					
8945	4	"The author ended with this paragraph because it is an example of how everything gets a fresh start in the spring. an example of this is that the geese will return home after the winter to start a new family and also in the winter the hibiscus leaves will die and then in the spring they will have a new start, I think the author uses this paragraph last because it’s a metaphor of how everything will get a fresh start and also Saeng will get a new chance to take her driving test just like the plant and geese will get a new chance at life."	2	2		2																					
8954	4	"The Author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it is resolutive to the entire reading before it. In the story Saeng (the girl) had been stressed from failing the @CAPS1 test. She was also saddened by the memory of the hibiscus plant back in her native country Vietnam. At the end of the story when it says “when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" ,(Ho) the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding symbolize change and adoption. Saeng will need to change and adapt to a new life to pass the test and feel better. This is why the Author @CAPS2 Ho, of the story “Winter Hibiscus” used a strong, symbolistic and resolutive end to her story."	3	2		3																					
8961	4	"The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome obsticles, & the next time she has these reminders she will succeed. When she says “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before had become... almost farmllular to her now” & this is saying she is getting used to the chages in her new life.

Essentaily, she felt as though she failed a test."	1	1		1																					
8971	4	"I think the author concludes the story with that parography because they want you to understand Saeng's strength. One reason I think they also end the story like that because she know inside that when her plant is strong and not covered in snow that she will be strong so that's when she wont`s to take her driving test. For example when she said, ”When the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.

The budding of the hibiscus is to her much more than just a flower. It shows the rejuvenation of new life within her just as flowers tend to bud in the spring. That is also why she chooses to take the test because her “budding” will occur in the spring, and she will have newly born confidence for the upcoming test.

Her old life is represented by the hibiscus; she used to the constants from back home. The geese symbolize her new life; they have become “almost familiar to her now” The obstacle she faces is passing the driving test.

He relates this to the flower being strong enough to survive the winter months. Meaning she’ll survive also. Although the flower isn’t the same as she had at home, change is inevitable and atleast she could hold on to that.

This shows the reader that it is very meaningful to Saeng to have this plant in her garden. Also by having that conclusion statement it help the reader understand the affection of her new country. Also the conclusion paragraph shows comfort at a time of disappointment. In the story it said, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.

9128	4	"These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion. It would be the same if he just  ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it was different."	1	1		1																					
9131	4	The author concludes with that because she means that she will try to go a whole season without thinking about home since she failed it in winter she will try agin in spring. Oho way you can tell this is by seeing that she is talking about how the plant is reminding her how life was befor they moved to the city. For example when she smelled the plant it almost seems to take her back in time to when she was little and they were growing wild and they were pretty.	1	1		1																					
9132	4	"The story Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho the author concludes the story with  ,”When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again"". The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader. Also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to. Furthermore when the geese do come back there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blommming then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gotten use to idea of living a new place and has met more people. Meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland .This will help Saeng achieve her goal of passing her test .Also I believe  the author ended the story with that passage because it makes people want to read it again or recommend the story to someone else .I know that I hate reading stories  that just end and don’t  tell you what happens next . However the Author resolved this by letting the reader know that Saeng wants to pass the test and is going to go back and try again."	2	3		3																					
9134	4	"The author ends the story that way to show Saeng's newfound determination. The whole story is about Saeng's journey one afternoon to come to acceptance with her new home, so it seems fitting to conclude with saeng's determination to pass her driving test and make life work in @LOCATION1. The story deals with several things Saeng finds that make her feel at home. “the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus. These @CAPS1 lead Saeng to feel more at home and make it fitting to end with Saeng's acceptance that she will stay in @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 is also inspired by the hibiscus who is “strong enough to make it through the cold months that’s what matters.” This reads to Saeng's determination to make it through her new life.

At first SaenG is very uneasy & disappointed in herself. ""I-I  failed the test,"" saeng says. ""For a long moment MRS. Pan ouvong said nothing."" You can tell at first the mother is disappointed & then as they talk the are planting which eases the mood. ""How would you like an omelet w/ slices of the bitter melon? "" ""I’d love it,"" saeng said. Her mood has now lightened & she is thaking a calm, collective decision to try again which is a reasonable decision to make when she is in a good frame of mind rather than upset & distraught."	1	2		2																					
9146	4	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” it has an unusual ending. There are many reason why the author decided to end the story this way. First, the girl failed the test which made her go into silien, when he agreed to take the test over it is a sigh of the will to suvive, and it shows that she is trying at he goal until she got it. Finnaly the ending could represent a new beging like when the snow melts away and changes winter into spring. This is what the ending of “Winter Hibiscus” means and this is why the author concluded it this way."	1	1		1																					
9147	4	"The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: “I mean, not like the kind we had at-at-"".This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows taht Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept it. This is the reason for the author to conclude this story like he does."	2	2		2																					
9149	4	"Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author uses the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went” It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didn’t pass her test she doesn’t think she will. So she motivates her self at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world.  "	2	2		2																					
9152	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to try again. So when she said “Then I will take that tes again”, it means she knows she has another chance. It shows that she is strong willed and wont give up easy. So what she is saying in the last paragraph is if you don’t succed the first time try and try again. In the story it says “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season”. In that part I can tell that she is already starting to change. So I think next time she’ll do great."	1	2		2																					
9156	4	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph to show she won’t give up if they don’t. I think this because the birds and the hibiscus will only reapeer if they survive. That means they will stay strong in the meantime just like her. She will survive her new surrondings and change to fit into the styles of @CAPS1 life.	2	1		2																					
9161	4	"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life. By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was. She was able to make a connection with the plant. The spring symbolizes the beginning of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life, and so Saeng wants to restart her life when the plant restarts its life and retaking her driving test."	3	3		3																					
9165	4	"The author concludes the story with this line because it shows that the geese was given the inspiration from the flower to come back, try again, and not give up. for example, Saeng vowed to herself that, “In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This quote shows that the hibiscus was the reason for her determination. and that she would come back, just like they did. thats why the author decided to conclude the story with that line because she wanted to show Saeng being inspired, and not giving up.  "	2	1		2																					
9166	4	"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho I think the author ends with that paragraph because it shows that she is determined to pass. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.” This shows she is determined because geese migrate every year and flowers always bud every year. She will keep coming back just like the geese and the hibiscus do. She will be determined to pass the test and fit in sooner or later. If she was not determined she might never pass and fit into her new society."	2	2		2																					
9167	4	"I believe the author ends the story with this sentence to show how she overcome obstacles emotionally and how the hibiscus plant is a sigh of hope for future. In the beginning of the story, saeng is upset about failing her drivers test and then on top of that she gets upsets about seeing the native plants of her homeland. “In the story it says, ”When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub” This quote shows how these plants remind her of her homeland, which she misses dearly and is very important to her. By bringing this plant back to her house, it's like she's bringing a little piece of her homeland. This quote:– “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" shows that Saeng has hope in her life again in the form of this is a big turn of events in her life that will make her much happier in @LOCATION1 which is why she ended the story with this sentence.  "	3	3		3																					
9168	4	"The author concludes the story like this because she is not ready to move on with her life. When everything turns back she will take that test and move on. But until her flowers are gone, she will not worry about school. For example she wrote “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. like geese.” This means that she has been use to change and has accepted the situation."	2	1		2																					
9169	4	"I think the author concludes the Story with that statement becauses, the snow doesn’t melt in the spring geese don’t return in the winter and the hibiscus is not budding til spring either. The hibiscus is a beautiful plants Saeng loved this plant.    "	0	0		0																					
9173	4	When the snow melts & the geese return then mean its almost spring.	0	0		0

When  she  failed  and her mother said it will be okay you can always try again."	1	1		1																					
9200	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng vowel to show a sense of change in Saeng. The winter time is very brutal like Saeng’s mum said but spring is when things come alive. I think is showing the sense in Saeng. Though winter is tough and you @MONTH1 get them trown around by the wind. When spring comes she will try the test again and come to life and enjoy the @LOCATION1 even thagh that she is far from rain. The author did the right thing to conclude the story with that vowel. 	1	1		1																					
9205	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show maybe by this time she will be comfortable with her new home. I know this because when I moved i didn’t like it because I didn’t have many friend but in like a year or two I was fine because I had a lot of friend. This is like Saeng because she misses her old home because she keeps talking about it then crying for example, when see saw the plant it was the one she had at her old home and she started crying because she missed it. In conclusion that is why he put that at the end of the story."	1	1		1																					
9212	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is what the whole story is about. It is about how Saeng misses home and filed the test when she bought the hibiscus. Saeng failed the test because she bought the hibiscus. She let herself by the flower and remember her home. That make her sad. In that last paragraph she is saying when the geese come back in the spring, she will be used to the new country and home, and will not fail the test. If she is tempted by something from home, she will not take it because it will make her sad. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is the main idea of the story. It shows her getting used to the new home"	2	1		2																					
9215	4	"Having failed the drivers test really upset Saeng. Not only that but she had to moved to a new country and the loss of her grandmother really made thing worse. The Hibiscus plant in this story, is like a symbol. It represents her life and reminds her of one in Vietnam. The way memorys come to her as she sees these flowers shows how she felt. It was all about starting new and overcoming obstacles. When she says, “… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows her starting new again and making it through the rough times, symbolized by winter. It was a symbol of herself and the hardship she will overcome. "	2	2		2																					
9225	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the story was about her getting accustomed to things being repeated in nature, so she added the last paragraph saying that when everything happens again she will do the same. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph."	1	1		1																					
9230	4	In this story it is about how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are similar when it comes to adapting to their surrounding and how her and the plant will keep continuing just like Saeng with her “test”. But I know this because its says “Then I will take that test again” her saying that is her saying she will thrive again just like the hibiscus plant. So in conclusion she really is much like the plant and will continue for many seasons to come and also adapt to the changes just like the hibiscus. 	2	2		2																					
9232	4	"In the story “winter Hibiscus“ by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it goes along with the story. In the story Saeng went to look for the pant that reminded her of her grandma. She found the plant and then she thought of her grandma and she cried. I think she was testing herself to see if she had gone on with her life but she failed. So I think she bought the plant so she can try again when the plant is in bloom."	1	1		1																					
9236	4	"In @CAPS1 Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author tries to make a message to saeng. When saeng saw the geese “slowly fading into the distance” she thought of herself. “When they come back"" Saeng will also come back to school. “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” means that saeng will return to the school and be a new person. “This hibiscus is budding” states that saeng is still growing, just like the hibiscus. She will then take that test again” because it’s a new start for her and a new beginning. Spring is an archetype of rebirth and a new life. since the flowers will be growing and having a new life, so will saeng."	2	2		2																					
9239	4	"The author concludes the story with this sentence because it shows the girl the is willing to overcome obstacles and although she @MONTH1 have failed once she will keep trying, It also shows a connection between the geese and the hibiscus and the girl wanting to overcome her obstacles. Also the girl wants to overcome her obstacle at a certain time."	2	1		2																					
9246	4	It shows that she loves her plants. The story tells you all of the plants and how she likes them. She thinks they are all unique and that she enjoys the plants more than school or anything else.	0	0		0																					
9249	4	"The author added the last paragraph because Saeng’s vow helps the reader Saeng and her pain, but her optimism that things will get better. I translate the vow into when things start to be normal again it will get much better for her in this new country. The spring symbolizes normal because at home where she thinks is normal is covered with beautiful flowers, like spring. The snow melting would be the pain going away. The geese returning would symbolize that saeng knows things will get better like she knows the geese will be back in the spring. The hibiscus in the story has symbolized her home and her grandmother, which symbolize happiness, so she will be happier when things get better."	2	2		2																					
9250	4	"The author concludes the story with this sentence because the girl saeng wanted to take the test again, but also wanted her habiscus to stay strong and to keep growing. So she said I will take the test again when my habiscus starts to bloom again."	1	1		1																					
9253	4	The reason that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng wants to do some thing good for herself. The reason I said this is cause in the last paragraph it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself “which means she wants what is best for herself.	1	1		1																					
9260	4	"The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to  herself , in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese situation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. “The   author chose this to end   the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart. Saeng   was still a bit homesick throughout the story. That could have possibly impacted how she did on her driving test. If one   waited a season or two, her homesickness would most likely drift away and she would be able to focus on meeting her goal. Missing her grandmother and her home in Vietnam must have taken a huge tell on her if it had anything to do with why she failed her driving test. Another reason the author could be that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit. Saeng breaking down in the greenhouse had a very melancholy feeling to it, and her vowing to herself that she would take the test over once spring come around kind of lifted your hopes up for her."	3	3		3																					
9264	4	"In in Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the last paragraph is a vow by the main character (Saeng) to retake her driver’s test when spring comes and her hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of hope to the sad story. It suggests that Saeng will be okay and will move past her longing for the country of her birth. “And in the war on moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. “Saeng was so sad and miserable. All of the flowers reminded her home country. She was depressed and homesick. When she got home, she planted a hibiscus plant in the frozen ground when it would bloom in the spring it would represent a new life and another chance. It meant that Saeng would not give up. Minfong Ho concluded Winter Hibiscus on a positive note with the last paragraph."	2	3		3																					
9267	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants the reader to feel like she is going to accomplish something because of the hibiscus and the geese. An example of her accomplishing something because of hibiscus is when the author mentions how her and her grandmother use to spend time together and do things together and her grandmother would do her hair and then put a hibiscus flower into it. Also the geese are a sing of accomplishment because she sees them in the sky flying south so they can survive the cold winter months in a warm place.	1	1		1

9282	4	"I feel the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some sense of relief with the flower. It also show that Saeng wasnt going to give up and she was going to keep trying. At first she was sad and upset but when she saw the flower that reminded her of home, she became happy and didn’t feel so bad about failing the test. The flower had a deep impact on her cause it reminded of home and when she started thinking about her grandmother she became a little sad, but then she thought about the flower and how much it meant to her, she felt comfort from the flower. I feel the concludes the story in good positive way."	2	1		2																					
9285	4	"The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to get across the theme of acceptance and determination. Saeng is very attached to the hibiscus plant because for her it represents her homeland and all the things she left behind. This last line represents many things. The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding all indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings. The fact the Saeng wants to retake her test shows how obstacles can be overcome, and goals achieved"	2	2		2																					
9288	4	"The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus “ this way because she is  creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng  was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her drivers test. The author describes this scene as “The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds.” The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here”. This symbolizes Saeng making it through as well. At the end of the story, Saeng  sees geese and realizes that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the qunet  repition of season upon season, almost familiar to her”. This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and hibiscus bloom."	3	3		3																					
9292	4	"In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from vietnam to the United States. The story tells of how different things in the @LOCATION3 spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, and the geese and the change of seasons. The last paragraph sums all that up, and how when everything farmiliar to her in Vietnam is being symbolized in the @LOCATION3, she will continue to try driving, and, ultimately, adapt to the changes the @LOCATION3 has brought her. This shows that Saeng can overcome her obstacles of the country, and is determined to do so. This paragraph is placed at the conclusion of the story because it reflects the theme of change and adaption throughout the story, but mostly reflection. The author takes time to explain how each individual item in the story reminds saeng of her old home, and in an effort to raise the tone of the story from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author recollects each each item in the final paragraph, showing that there is hope for Saeng and her family.

9298	4	"The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succed, one must keep trying. Saeng will adapt to her new copiuntry in time but not if she spends heer time wishing to go back to her homeland. The hibiscus is a reminder to hers of starting a new and adapting to society. Saeng will retry her driver’s test when the plant buds again, starting its life cycle all over again"	1	2		2																					
9299	4	She is say that she will take the test again after the snow melts in the spring. So she can watch the geese the hibiscus bud while she is taking her test and try to pass it.	1	1		1																					
9306	4	The girl says that she is going to take the test again when the Hibiscus blooms shows that she misses her country and still wants to be connected somehow. When she takes the test as the plant blooms its like support from her country. The plant is symbolic of her progress because her growth is like the plant. When she first got it she wast ready to go out and do things she still hadnt adapted lutlly to the environment just like the hypiscus wast adapted to the wather and had to wait till @DATE1 to bloom.	2	2		2

9317	4	"All throughout the story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author gives the feeling as hope and comfort that is obtaned by Saeng when she thinks about the past. And to continue this feeling as hope, the last sentence gives the feeling that Saeng will be better off than she had been at the beginning of the story. For example, at the beginning of the story, Saeng was feeling alrenated, alone, and misplaced in her new country. But as the story progresses, she starts to develop peace of mind and certainly that her future will be brighter with the passing of the and her growing confidence. In conclusion, the author uses the last sentence to give a feeling of hope for Saeng’s future and growing confidence."	2	2		2

A fresh start like the blossoming hibiscus. A fresh start with the drivers test."	2	2		2																					
9344	4	"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt &the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldnt push things off. You should always deal wi them as they come up. So in the story the girl is showing a bad example. I believe the author wanted to make a point of not doing that. Overall, to add this phrase in this story was the right thing to do to try and show the right way of doing and going about these certain things"	0	0		0																					
9371	4	"Saeng wanted to show that she was strong and determined. She wanted to make the best of things with what she had. She had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country.

This is her new home with new hibiscus. After all, winter is no time for a flower."	1	2		2																					
9374	4	 The author leaves the story there because it keeps you guessing on what is going to happen. That is really all you need to know about the story. The important parts the author has told al ready & the future is a whole different story. It doesn’t matter if Saeng passes the test or what happens over the winter. The author has told us everything to know about the importance of this person & her mother	1	1		1																					
9376	4	The author might of concluded the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng isnt @CAPS1 to stop trying shes @CAPS1 to work harder.

For example back in her home town she had hibiscus's and everything was fine and normal, she lived her life and so on, well then she moved to the u.s, and she didn’t have any hibiscus, she just failed her driving test, she feels miss placed, and doesnt fit in. So, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost. She felt a sense of security In conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start."	2	2		2																					
9392	4	"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it resembles to her own life, that she will have another chance, just as geese will come back again. The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards @DATE2 and Flowers come back. The hibiscus plant will bloom again and that will renew, In a way, her warming thought of her old home. Then that will be the time to retake her driving test that she failed, which was before she bought the plant. The author added this last part because it tied and matched so well with the story."	2	2		2																					
9393	4	The reason why the author concludes the store with on small paragraph is because some time the little things count the most and the authore thouth t that in two setses that he could summarz the most important things in the story and I think that the author did a great job.	0	0		0																					
9395	4	The author concludes with this sentence for a couple reasons. Saeng feels that she can’t do it until the spring because that when the geese come back. Also that is when the hibiscus buds. In a way she feels as though she will blossom in spring and be able to pass the test.	1	1		1																					
9398	4	"I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again. For example, despite failing her driving test she decides to take it over after having the experience of planting with her mother. It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again. In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that she knows that she can take the test again and accomplished that. In conclusion, that is why I think the author concluded with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
9400	4	the author includes this as the last paragraph because it could give Saeng’s mother hope. It could give hope because they could really need Saeng to pass the test.	1	1		1																					
9401	4	"It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, “This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader."	2	3		3																					
9410	4	The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test.	1	1		1																					
9411	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a personification involving snow smelting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. It’s explaining moments in time. The author describes how isolated the hibiscus is."	0	0		0

The story was preety bad because I don’t even know what she  failed  so I didn’t  like it."	1	1		1																					
9422	4	"Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that she’s able to pass this test that seems important to her. When the author write, “and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph."	2	3		3																					
9427	4	"The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar. The plant represents Saeng’s strength and abilities. She knows that only when she is stronger, in the spring like the plant, will she be ready to retake the test. Her hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
9436	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides closure to both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you’ve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adopt to the way we drive here, along with all our rule and laws. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way."	2	2		2																					
9438	4	"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author includes the phrase, -When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.- because she wanted to make the story end Saeng finding the positive views on her new home and positive views in the future and have her look forward to it. Throughout the short story, Saeng happens to have a sad disposition about her new home and how the plants remind her recent home.- “I mean its not the kind we at-at-“ she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burt into tears again.- This phrase shows that Saeng really missed her home and was truly sad about it. The concluding phrase shown before shows that she found the strength to look positivly at the future of her new home."	3	2		3																					
9440	4	"I think the author of “Winter Hibiscus” said “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test  again.” to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isn’t giving up. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. That is probably why the author ended it that way."	1	1		1																					
9442	4	"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” I believe that the Hibiscus and the driver’s test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The author’s intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her driver’s test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and start to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage. It will blossom like Saeng.  "	3	3		3																					
9444	4	"I think the author concludes the story with this because shes proving she has the strength to do something that she failed the first time again. She took this plant and looked at it as a memory and a passage of time. Saeng planted it as a reminder of home and her promise. Saeng said, ”Its not a real one”  ""Not like the kind we had before.” Saeng loved home and wish she was back there but her new promise was what had mattered."	2	1		2																					
9454	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started. I think that is why because she says “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.”"	0	0		0																					
9457	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. Saeng had a bad, from failing the test to her deep feeling of loss, @CAPS1 after finding the hibiscus and planting it she seemed to be enlightened, while as she missed her home land but still had the memories, which was comforting to her. She shows determination, because she declares she will take that test again, and seems to have more confidence in herself. The author adds that saeng will take the test again in the spring. When looking at archetypes, spring is time of new beginning and life. When the hibiscus is budding(being reborn), she will take the test. It will be a new, better start for saeng too."	2	3		3																					
9458	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show determination. It shows that saeng wants to take her time to adjust to her new life and her  new surroundings. Then she thinks it might feel more like this place is becoming a home. She feels that maybe, if shes been used to this new place for awhile she will have a better chance at passing the test. she is determined to pass the test."	2	1		2																					
9461	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he want the ourtose to think about what he said to want to read more. For example I was reading a book that end in a quesiton and I wanted to read more of what the answer to the quesition is. Another example is that I was reading another book and that was ending in a stentment So I want to read anther book that they have but they don't have One so I don't know how the story ended. Thats why the end stories like that so they can make you read another book with the ending.	1	1		1																					
9463	4	The author concluded the story with that message is because If you think about it. if not that seems all the whole story and leavs a opening for a requal. It's ovious that whole point of the story is to make you think.	1	1		1																					
9484	4	"By this quote, the author is explaining that Saeng will eventually be ready for her test. When the geese return, they're ready to return From their migration and when the hibiscus is budding, it is ready to turn into a beautiful flower. Saeng believes that in the spring, since the flower and the geese are ready, she too will be ready."	2	1		2

"	2	2		2																					
9496	4	"I think what the narrator means by saying this she wants to come back when everything is beautifle again. She wants to WAIT FOR ALL OF THE SNOW TO MELT AND GEESE TO RETURN SO SHE CAN SEE ALL THE COLORS OF THE FLOURS AND IF SHE PASSES HER TEST THIS TIME, SHE WILL GET TO DRIVE PAST ALL THE FLOURS. THATS WHAT I THINK THE CHARECTER MEANS iN THiS STORY."	0	0		0

9503	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is given a small glimmer of hope by the winter hibiscus. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland, Vietnam, which pleases her. Also, the fact that the hibiscus she purchases can survive winter, unlike the hibiscus of her homeland, symbolizes Saeng’s determination to adapt to her new country. The future of the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng’s survival and adaptation to her new country, which will include her retaking her driving test."	2	2		2																					
9505	4	The author of this story concludes it with this paragraph to show Saeng’s  determination .  I  say this hibiscus in  the  story the sees  the  plant and it joyed to see it and is so happy but the reminders doing her grandmother ‘s  hair she  tries.  She snow this as a test for herself . She  want to see if she could be on and try not will on the past . When she  isn’t  home she said “ I failed the test .” This snows melt she want is to move on but it hasn’t  as  easy as she hope it to be. So when the as this hibiscus the shows life this paragraph it shows that Saeng is trying  to move on and she is different  to  a English her seal.	1	2		2																					
9512	4	The author concludes this story with a sentence like this because at the end of winter into spring the snow will melt and the trees and flowers will blosom into different colored flowers. After all the flowers had blosomed the leaves had come out and then the pollin had found the right kind of trees . At the end of @DATE2 into fall the leaves start to die and change color then the leaves will fall off. Then it snows all over again.	0	0		0																					
9514	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph. “Where Saeng vowed silently to herself,” in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscun is budding, then I will take that test again. Minpong Ho did so because she failed the test. Saeng failed to fine the fine–toothed comb, the hibiscus hedge, the well, and her gentle grandmother. Apperantly this things could be found after the snows melt and the geese reture and hibiscus is budding."	1	1		1																					
9519	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng can over come her weaknesses and succeed in her newhome. What the @CAPS1 “In the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” It means she’ll try the @CAPS2 Test again try new test to make her like wheres she’s at and what she can @CAPS3 from it."	1	1		1																					
9520	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The first reason is to show that Saeng is determined young girl. By vowing to take the “test” again, she shows she is determined and not giving up. Another reason is because the author wanted to ampasize the importance of the idea of Saeng personality."	1	1		1																					
9524	4	I believe the author uses this as the last paragraph because it tells of how Saeng wants to overcome and be strong even though. She misses her home. For example Saeng believed that since she cried when she saw the hibibiscus plant she failed and she believes she will get stronger over time.  	1	1		1																					
9525	4	"The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to sum up the realization and determination Saeng obtains. First of all, Saeng starts out upset after failing her test. When she sees the flower and goes to find it at a shop she is overwhelmed by this small reminder of her old home. That small flower made her realize how much she missed her old home and buying it becomes a nessesity for her. She probably felt that with that flower she would always have a little piece of home in this newer world. After realizing that memories are whats  important and seeing that flower’s determination to survive a cold winter, she develops the determination to take the test again. She vows to do so because she has gained faith from the flower’s survival and her realization of important memories. All in all ,that ending paragraph reveals these specific messages"	3	3		3																					
9529	4	Resons I think the author concludes the saying at the top. I think he concludes the becus she was vary eger on passing the test. She told her self and she vowed to take the test again when the geese return and the snow melsts. Another reson I think the author concludes this is becus she faled it the first time and it is a big thing for her and she is vary eger on passing it. That is why I think the author added this to the story.	1	1		1																					
9536	4	"In the story the author included that concluding paragraph because if you had read the rest of the story you would know that the person was talking about when she comes back that she wanted to take the test again because it would be such nicer weather then it was the first time she took it, another reason why I believe the author added this conclusion paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if they really did understand the novel and what she was really going for in the novel. So the author first wanted to make shore the reader would understand the ending of the book better with that conclusion paragraph at the end. These are the reason why I think the author added that concluding paragraph at the very end of that novel."	0	0		0

For example it ends in “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibsiscus is budding, then I will return and take the test again."	2	1		2																					
9540	4	The Author concluded the story like this because she had another view of Saeng. He would think that every season that she would be in a different mood @CAPS1 that the garden would change so that Saeng mom would alway be out side for every season.	0	0		0																					
9543	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because she is making a promise to herself to take the test again so she can pass it. She will do it when it is spring with the hibiscus is budding. She need to take the test and start driving. I think that is a good thing to when people vowed thing to themself."	1	1		1																					
9548	4	"The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesn’t come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, that’s for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then. The ending to the story can be anything you want it to be, it is up for interpretation. To different people it could mean different things."	1	1		1																					
9562	4	"The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity. Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam"	3	3		3																					
9566	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph bY the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she found a hobby to look forward too An example “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it overhead at lock of Canada geese flew by”, That why the author cludes the story with this paragraph."	1	1		1

9570	4	"The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that."	2	2		2																					
9572	4	It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved the hibiscus so when spring come and the hibiscus would bloom it would  be the best time to take that test again from already failing it. It would probably make her more confident to take the driving test again at the right time. So in conclusion that’s why the author concludes that paragraph in the story	1	1		1																					
9584	4	"I think the author concludes the story the way she did to show determination. I also believe that it symbolizes adaption, when the season changes, as will Saeng, she will take the test again. Everything will soon go back to normal and will adjust just like she will. Everything is “almost familiar to her now” (@NUM1)."	1	2		2																					
9590	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination despite her sadness. She misses Vietnam, but she will take the test again next year. The author’s choice of words in the concluding paragraph convey a sense of hope and something to look forward to. In the story, Saeng is disapointed in herself for failing the test, but buying the plant helps her because it reminds her of home. The idea that Saeng is persistant and the hopeful tone of the story are expressed in this final paragraph."	1	2		2																					
9594	4	"The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time “when the shows me”. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, “Saeng  brokedown and wept!” The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the “show will melt” and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country. She referred to the plant as “yet another old friend”. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome. She is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge. Therefore, he ????  that to make a hopeful home . ??? a life lesson of courage."	3	3		3																					
9602	4	" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was waiting for the winter time to be over. After the winter time, Saeng going take a test again and she can plants the flower. Saeng really like this hibicus and she doesn't want it to die on winter time."	1	1		1																					
9610	4	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring. The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it."	2	2		2																					
9613	4	"People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus”. In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2 She has various rememberances of her past home while visiting a plant store. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says “In the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again”. This shows Saeng’s desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng’s emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here."	2	2		2

9633	4	"The author ends the story with that paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. Failing the driver’s test was a set back for Saeng so she plans to take it again. She plans to use the hibiscus as motivation, because the winter for the hibiscus is like overcoming an obstacle."	1	1		1																					
9637	4	I think the author concludes that in the story becaue he is saying when the geese is coming back.	0	0		0																					
9639	4	"The author concludes the story like that to give the reader the idea that you cant just quit if you fail. When Saeng said that when spring comes around I will return and take the test again, that shows that she will not quit and life will go on. That’s why I think the author chose to conclude the story like that."	1	1		1																					
9642	4	"The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. “ ...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng."	1	2		2																					
9644	4	"There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, it’s the end of the story so it’s a good way to end it because it’s the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and it’s short and sweet. Which makes it a great ending to the story. It’s not like most endings to a story so it’s unique. Because most stories aren’t about nature. In conclusion, there are many reasons the narrator could have choose to end the story with this paragraph."	0	0		0																					
9654	4	When spring comes and all the snow melts then she is going to plant newseeds. The author concludes that because she didn’t do good on the test the first time.

I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home. She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring."	2	2		2																					
9669	4	"In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus” by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depress ful mood because she failed the drivers test so she is very upset. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs. The winter starts to give her the feels all hope is lost. “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” To her the strange things are starting to feel the same year by year no new hope, no new anything just the same old thing day by day. This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation. “She found that she was still to shakey to say the word at home, lest she burst into tews again.” She can’t say home because home isn’t hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of emence emotion’s all having to deal with her past sr the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so thats why it fits when it does"	3	3		3																					
9672	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will go back after winter to take care of it. The author puts this at the ending paragraph because he is telling how much she cares about this plant cause she takes care of it because it reminds her of her hometown. So that is the reason she takes such good care of it so she will have something with her to remind her of her home.	1	1		1

9700	4	"The author ends the story with Saeng vowing to herself the relationship between passing and driving test and the significance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is linked to the way things used to be for her in Vietnam. For example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was “Madagascar periwinkle” in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower adapts to its surrounding when taken from a different country in accordance to Saeng adjusting to life in @LOCATION3. The reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again symbolizes that connection of the flower to the way she lives now. For instance, her ability and determination that when that flower buds she will overcome obsticles. Another is a connection of her past experiences. And it was a sense of comforting to her after she failed her driving test. The author linked the flower’s significance to the ending of the story showing the hope and dedication to Saeng and the obstacles she passes to get where she is today."	2	2		2																					
9711	4	"The author concludes the story this way to show Saeng does not give up and is determined to pass the test. The narration says “Not like the kind we had @NUM1]. Saeng feels very strongly about her old home and wants hibiscus just like her and her grandmother used to have. Because Saeng would not bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is sad and determined to get another one. The text also states, “… and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @NUM2]. This also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again. She misses her home and wants hibiscus just like she had at her old home. "	2	2		2																					
9712	4	In this story the reason that the author concludes things this way is to pick a tone that feel comfortable to test again. The person who will take the test again my have picked the tone with relation to her past which she takes the time to prepare herself and maybe that is something her parents or grandparents taught her.	1	1		1																					
9718	4	"In the story, at the end of the last paragraph the author wrote that “why they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (last paragraph). The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to mention that Saeng is a student and she had failed a test. Even though Saeng is so interest in flowers she also cares about her school too. When the snows melt Saeng will take the test just like the hibiscus is budding and starting to blossome."	1	1		1																					
9724	4	In the story “winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to foreshadow the future for Saeng It seems like the author is trying to say Saeng will be taking time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before she takes the test again. It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has once failed. The perserverance in Saeng shows and will help her overcome many things in her new country. In the text when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole she says “let me help mother.” This shows her love towards her mother and her care for the plant that represents her pastime. So in the end of the story adding the vow was a good way to show Saeng’s commitment.	2	3		3																					
9727	4	"The author concludes this story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with that paragraph as a sign of reasurrance. Saeng had had a tough few years adapting to the United States from Vietnam, this paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge just like a bump in the road. Saeng had just had a rough day after just failing her driver’s test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse she says, “That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?” Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay. The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says,”…in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.’ The winter is a hardship for the geese in that they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is time Saeng will be away from Vietnam. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome it, so will she. This last paragraph is a good, positive and hopeful ending to this touching story, so the reader knows to have hope in life.

Her mother feels bad for her so she doesn’t get upset that the hibiscus cost @MONEY1. After planting the hibiscus Saeng says to herself, ….In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. The author uses this paragraph to make you think about whether or not Saeng will fail or pass the test again. It also makes you wonder about what kind of test since the author says “hibiscus is budding”, and “the geese return”, It must be a test that you can only take once a year. because she says that “In the spring"" she will take the test again."	1	1		1																					
9760	4	"The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author ends with this promise or commitment because it shows hope and determination. Saeng vowing to herself “I will take that test again,” shows her determination and unwillingness to fail. That is enough to bring hope to someone who has failed and wants another chance. This paragraph also sums up and displays Saeng’s good character. It shows Saeng’s strength because even though she failed the first time she was going to put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed. To fail and try again shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” brings everything back full circle. It holds the promise of Spring and better things to come with it. There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with ”when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”"	1	2		2																					
9761	4	"The author added it in at the end not only to make the story have a happy, hopeful ending, but to show the reader that Saeng slowly adjusted to the changes in life. The paragraph above explains that Saeng realized that ""the many things that seemed strange before had become,... almost farmiliar to her now."" So the author lastly concludes that eventhough she failed the test this time, just as the geese will return in the spring, then she can take the test again. She just the point of the story across and its a ""cheerful"" way to end it."	2	2		2																					
9778	4	The author concludes the story with that sentence a vowed to the flower. It’s just stating that Saeng will come back and try again next year & see if it works out with the hibiscus.	1	1		1

9782	4	"The author concludes the story by the paragph that says, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take that test again"", because the author wants to convey that. Saeng isn’t going to quit. She is determined to take and pass the test. It also meas that saeng will wait for the right moment to take the test. She will wait till things get better. The situation that she is in improves because it say’s, ""The snow melt, the geese return, and hibiscus is budding.”"	1	1		1																					
9786	4	The author concludes the story this way to show that saeng intends to try again. an example of her trying again is when she sees the plant and relizes what it symbolizes to her. Another example is her saying that she wants to plant the hibiscas herself so that she holds the memories forever. This is why the author concludes the story in this manner.	1	1		1																					
9787	4	"The author coNcludes the story with this paragraph because she was tryiNg to say siNce the hibiscus is plaNted we are goiNg to see how it does with the winter.

9801	4	"There are many reasons this paragraph is included. It shows the flower will emotionally encourage her when it is budding, because it will remind her of home. This is shown when she says “a blossom of two would have blown into the well” It reminds her of her homeland. It also is to show she is adapting to her new home. when the geese flew by she said”she realized that many things that she thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now.” This shows how she is adapting and is now enjoying her new life. This final paragraph is important because it shows how her life is changing."	2	2		2

9816	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is getting used to living in a new place. Towards the end of the text, Saeng says that many things she thought were strange before had become familiar to her. The winter hibiscus was comforting, and reminded Saeng of her home. she says “In the spring when the snows melt” because she is beginning to get used to “the quiet repetition of season upon season”. The geese, which form a distinctive V are becoming familiar to her. The last paragraph is an effective way to end the story because it shows that saeng is becoming accostumed to her new surroundings and is hopeful the future.     "	2	2		2																					
9823	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she’ll hopefully be stronger. By that I mean she’ll feel comfortable in her new environment and she want miss her home as much. Also she tired the year but failed the best because she didn’t get her grandmother what she asked for and she spent it on something else. That is why I think the author added this paragraph to this story.  	1	1		1																					
9828	4	"The author has a good reason in which she concludes the story with this. The main character of the story, Saeng, moves to the united states from Vietnam and fails her drivers test. Saeng has not adapted to the life in the united states and when she sees a firmilar hibiscus plant she buys if for her memory’s of Vietnam. The author is trying to show that since saeng planted the hibiscus during winter, when it blooms in spring she will be ready to try to pass her drivers test because she will have adapted the life in the united states. The theme of the story would be if you are moving away from somewhere you grew up in, bring things that remind you of that place so you still have a little of that culture with you. Therefore the author begins and ends with the same subject."	1	2		2																					
9832	4	"The author ends the story with “when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” because she is concluding that the hibiscus comforts her and once once the plant is well and alive, she will be comfortable to take the test. In reality, seeking comfort from a plant seems nieve but its not that she has comfort in the plant itself but that the hibiscus reminds her of her home in which she misses dearly. Once the plant is thriving, as such as her tropical home, she believes that it will comfort her enough to pass the test. In conclusion, this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph."	2	2		2																					
9835	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants us to know that she’s not giving up on her test. The author wants to inform the readers that she’s not giving up “…then I will take that teat again” which clearly states she still has hope. Author wants to continue on her test to find the right flower. This is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
9843	4	"The author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few reasons. One reason why is because the change in Saeng‘s attitude. In the beginning of the story Saeng is upset and has no hope of adjusting to her new home, but by adding that paragraph at end of the story it shows that she has hope, and she’s not going to give up. Another reason why this paragraph concludes the story is to show that life does go on in toughest situation. The fact that a new season will begin figuratively shows Saeng will not always feel this way that she too will change. In conclude the story with that paragraph for a few good reasons."	2	2		2																					
9849	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test again.” She does this to end in hope of taking the test again and doing good. Also the author ends it this way because Saeng is believing in herself so she made a vowe to do something. Hopefully that will encourage her more and also motivate her."	1	1		1																					
9850	4	The author of this story concludes the story with a paragraph basically stating that the winters coming things are going to die off then come back next spring. Shes refering to the plant. I think she is basically keeping track of the memories it left her and the thoughts that came to mind when she used her senses to connect with the flower. Saeng is ancious to see how the flower buds next spring and what other new things she @MONTH1 experience.	1	1		1																					
9862	4	The reason why the author used this paragraph is because he was sag that the snow go away in spring time that all.	0	0		0																					
9869	4	She is saying here that she will start a new leaf when spring comes around she is going to start a new leaf and she is going to do better on her driving test.

9877	4	I belive the author concludes the story with this paragraph because. She wanted the reader to know that just because she failed that it doesn’t mean her lifes over. She will requperate and to the same thing next year.	1	1		1																					
9880	4	"The Author of “Winter Hibiscus” ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes. It shows that Saeng has determination to overcome obstacles and it uses the plant as a metaphor, just like the rest of the story, the Hibiscus represents Saeng or adjusting to change. The plant “dies” in the winter and this is equivlent to @PERSON1 not getting her drivers licens, but the plant will come back, representing determination or adjustment, this is why Saeng says she will go back and pass the test because she has adjusted and is now determined to overcome this obstacle."	2	2		2																					
9895	4	"The author concludes the story here to show that Saeng would not give up. She simpley set a time for her to try again. Saeng wants to make it in this world and wants to have a good life, so she tries new things"	1	1		1																					
9896	4	The story “Winter Hibiscus” is a good-day story about a foreign girl trying to adapt to @LOCATION1. She likes tropical flowers. The reason why the author chose to write the last paragraph like that is because it finishes the story right. That ending when the goes man away and the flowers start to grow she will try to fit in the spring.	1	1		1																					
9907	4	"I believe the author ended this story with this paragraph because life lives on. ""When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" proves that shes moving on with life and so will all the creature in the world. Also even knew she moved to a new country doesn’t mean she cant still enjoy the things from her homeland, “but she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to the Big Mac.” thats why the author put that last paragraph to show that life lives on.  "	2	2		2																					
9923	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that character will retry what she failed. In the story the character loves gardening so when her favourite plant comes back she will retry to pass her test.	1	1		1																					
9932	4	"There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First that ending gives a lot of emotion which doesn't cause people to think the story wasn't interesting. Another reason is that it shows strength. Not physical strength, but mental strength. Saeng is stating that even though she failed the test the first time she will take it again. Another reason the author @MONTH1 have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit. It shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again. Overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up."	1	2		2																					
9939	4	The importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant. It seems that because the author is not in her native country that she doesn’t have a lot around in this new place that can comfort her. The author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldn’t be able to gives her strength to do anything that she can. It is possible that whatever the challenge @MONTH1 be that the author is trying to get by the fact that she has some support from the plant gives her the achievement and confidence to complete her task	1	2		2																					
9940	4	The author concludes the story with this because the hibiscus and Saeng are very similar. Also the narrator compares her to the geese returning. The geese returning represents her starting over at drivers school and doing it again. The hibiscus represents her staying strong in the winter and the come spring she builds up and goes and takes the test again. That is what the narrator choose to end the story that way.	2	2		2

9947	4	"The author of the story, Winter Hibiscus, concluded the story with that pharagraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng is finally going to start getting used to her new home. She won’t spend so much time dreaming about her past. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” I believe that thats what she needed to get on with her life."	1	1		1																					
9949	4	I belive that the author conclude the story with this because he is saying that she will keep trying and will not give up and will keep on trying. I say this because she just moved to america from Vietnam and is having a hard time adjusting to life in america. I think the geese represent something that is always  changing their surroundings and when they come she is going to fly again to get her licence.  	1	2		2																					
9951	4	"Saeng  would  silently in spring she will take the that again in the good ending to this story it was as goods ended  because the story had listed   come  of  malance  ready and spring it and of the plant beautiful  time the spring the all as plant ending because spring in a near trying and for the take the test again of that time , to think it’s a goods ending because the ruler strong are  about   machines saeng and spring it  and  makes  is near paragraph . That is why its is a good ending plant to the stays.   "	1	1		1																					
9952	4	"The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus means to saeng. To her it is a symbol of strength and comfort. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter, she knows that she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. She is also going to take the test again when the hibiscud are budding since it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding. I also think the author concludes the story this way, because both the plant and Saeng are going to have to overcome obstacles. The plant must survive the winter and come back in the spring. While Saeng must pass her driver’s test. Finally I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng. If it survives she knows that she too will survive, and life goes on."	2	2		2

9960	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they want people to know what happened in the story. Also because they want people to know what it might mean or say in relation to the story. The sentence means that when spring comes and when the snow might melt the plants will be out and budding but by next class or next school year he will come out and be brave and take the test all over again. That is what the sentence means of the story and how it might be compared to both things in different ways.	1	1		1																					
9966	4	The author concludes with this paragraph because she/he wanted to close the story with a conclusion that portrays the story. The author talked about the hibiscus in the story as a “comfort in time of distress” a hobby or thing she likes doing with her spear time. In conclusion the author concludes with that paragraph for the reasons stated in the @ORGANIZATION1	0	0		0																					
9970	4	"I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to get the morle of the story.

9971	4	I think the Author concludes this in the story because. It is a key information for this story. Because. It is dealing with her mom. She loves to work on the garden and become a garden and have a really job. Like her mom	1	0		1																					
9981	4	" In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author @CAPS1  the most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flowers, to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng the Winter Hibiscus is like  story books, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her “ gentle grandmother” from her first home. @CAPS1  the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forgot who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why @CAPS1 the ended the story “Winter Hibiscus “ with the paragraph selected."	3	2		3																					
9983	4	"The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that “when they come back ... I will take the test again,” (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, “A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept “(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character. "	2	2		2																					
9993	4	"The author has concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking the test again another time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng wanted to take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. She feels ready when that time comes around. Saeng is trying to say to herself that she needs more time to be ready for this test. When she gets more time to be ready for the test, she will take the test again. I think that is why the author wrote the paragraph as a conclusion."	1	1		1																					
9997	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows that he meased up on the test and he saying when spring comes back around he will de ready to take the test I know it is spring because he sad when the snow melts.	1	1		1

10029	4	The author concluded the story in this manner so that the audience would feel sympathy and understanding for the things that Saeng and her family were going through in this hard time. It makes the reader feel sympathy for Saeng because all she can think of to make herself feel better is her home town and how she got taken away.	1	1		1

10036	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it still shows how determined saeng is to take the test again and pass it this time. By ending this story with the paragraph the author is creating suspense is probably for a sequel of another story.	1	1		1																					
10046	4	The story concludes that paragraph because its tell you that there changes in the weather and season as much as there is in your life.

10065	4	"I believe the author used that statement to end the story because by the end Saeng was ready to face her obstacles again, also it shows that she was apprechiating  her new environment. The plant that Saeng purchased her mother stated that, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here” @CAPS1 it’s telling Saeng if the plant can make it through the harsh conditions then just maybe you can make it through living in a new country.

Although she was disappointed the hibiscus was “exquisite” and as she said the @CAPS1 word “dokor malik” meaning hibiscus she “savored the feel of the word on her tongue.” @CAPS2 the joy and comfort is what the flower brings to Saeng, she will take the test again in the spring when “the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, thus bringing joy, love, and comfort to the reader as they feel what Saeng feels."	3	2		3

The quote can also apply to Saeng’s situation in the short story, “Winter Hibiscus.” Saeng fails her drivers test and, when walking home after the test, notices a hibiscus flower which reminds her of her homeland. Sadness encompasses her and she purchases the plant to pocify her grief. She brings it home and is at first reprimanded by her mother but then thanked for buying. While Saeng is planting the hibiscus, she hears the honk of Canada geese which had become familiar to her by then. The text says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.” This quote shows the adaptation she had to face in coming to @LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower, she will adapt to the terrain and toils of @LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspires her to push forward and try again for license as the plant pushed forward through winter."	3	3		3

This is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test. Also it shows how the hibiscus she just planted is already important to her. The second thing it does is dreams about future conclusions. The reader does not know if she will pass the test next time but assumes that she will because of the way she vows it.

Also, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that it ends the story knowing that she will take the test over again, so she knows she has faith to take the test again and make her mother proud that she passed. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph"	1	1		1																					
10386	4	"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author’s purpose in concluding the story with “When they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again,” was to show how the hibiscus and the other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.” This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, “How strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs. “This symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold months”. Saeng identifies herself with this description, and so decided that when the hibiscus is done dealing with the bad stuff, she will have, also, and will have budded and grown just like her plant. Then, she will be ready to achieve her goal."	3	3		3																					
10399	4	"The author ended the story “Winter Hibiscus” with Saeng vowing to retake the test. He ended it this way to show the themes of this story. One theme of the story is to never give up. The winter Hibiscus has to last through the long winter but it does survive, and it inspires Saeng to keep trying. Another theme is to overcome your obstacles. The flower faces many dangers, but still manages to blossom. Saeng wants to overcome her obstacles and pass the test. Therefore the ending of the story displays the themes."	2	1		2																					
10401	4	I think The Author finish the story of with that @CAPS1 the girls see’s this plant As A symbol of straidth And fAith so she will tAke the test Next year When it comes Back @CAPS1 she truly likes the plant And she hopes it will Bring her lack.	1	1		1																					
10404	4	"Authors chose their closing paragraphs carefully. The author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes. There are resons the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph. The authors chose of the ending paragraph is very important. The character says “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The hibiscus that she mentions represents the ability to overcome obsticles. In the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it. That is why the author concludes with that. The author also writes. “when the snow melts and the geese return” This to the character represents new beginings and chances. That gives the character the sense that next time around she will pass the test. The author adds that paragraph in the end to symbolize new beginnings and chances and the ability to over come obsticles. Authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons. This author did as well. The author did it to symbolize things."	2	2		2																					
10405	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of a saying that when its cold and silent she’s hot to her self but when the snow  melts and spring is here. She’s said  and does lots of fun things.	0	0		0																					
10410	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show saeng’s everlasting determination. This idea of her determination to succeed can be connected to the plant she brings home. The plant she knew grew wild where she used to live, but she found it potted in the United States which is limiting its growth, just like saeng’s new country seems unordinary, and she feels out ofplace."	1	2		2																					
10411	4	"The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself she’ll take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that “many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.” And when she’s in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother. Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re.taking the test because it demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and fereshadows her future and sucess and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.  "	3	3		3																					
10424	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story Saeng struggles with her past and overcoming it. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldn’t help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, “I-I failed the test.” When she says “the test” she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph Saeng says she will retake the test. She said, “When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces."	2	2		2																					
10425	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to end the story with hope. For example, since she has move to the United States, she feels homesick. To make it worst, she failed the driver’s test. “She found she was still to shaky to say the words at home, lest the burst into tears again. “This quote helps add to the homesick girl. She concludes with this paragraph to show that when spring comes, she’ll start out fresh and re-live her life in @LOCATION2."	2	2		2																					
10432	4	 The author concludes the story with this paragraphto show that saeng is determined. She says that she is going to take the test again which shows that she is determined. Even though saeng failed her driverd test she is not going to give up.	1	1		1																					
10436	4	"This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, “She lifted her head.” This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds. The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time. When she says, “when the snow melts and the geese return,” this shows us that she is like the geese because their both going back for a hand fought journey. Also, when she says, “and this hibiscus budding” she is saying when everything comes to life and is at it’s highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up. Although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring."	2	3		3																					
10440	4	The author ends the story with this sentence because Saeng needs a break before she takes the test again. Saeng is comparing to indifferent things; Flowers & taking a test. That is significant. Thats why the author ends the story with this sentence.	1	1		1																					
10447	4	"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning. The geese are comming back to restart their life there, the hibiscus will be blooming, and she will re-take the test. At the beggining Saeng was depressed about having to leave her old country and grandmother. Saeng began to feel “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her”. She remembered how some of these plants grew wild in bushes or between cracks in the sidewalk. Saeng saying what she did in the last paragraph is her. showing that she found comfort and confidence in the hibiscus. Memories of the past showed her the way and now she is going to retake her drivers test."	2	2		2																					
10449	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng wants to take the test again, but she wants to take the test again when everything else good and happy returns like the plant and the geese. This is true because Saeng says ""When they (geese) come back… and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This shows her maturity and happiness and happiness. She wants to do something hard and maybe even not fun when everything else returns and is happy. Just as when she came, she was sad, but when the geese and plant comes back she wants to help them through this and make them happy too. This way they all can be happy at the same time."	1	1		1																					
10470	4	"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it. And as also gives her memory of where she used to live before she had moved to the @ORGANIZATION1. Saeng had seemed out of place she did not know what to do."	1	1		1																					
10475	4	"In the story , “Winter Hibiscus”, Saeng is new to @LOCATION1. She is missing home when she sees a hibiscus in a flower shop. After she takes the flower home and plants it in her backyard, she decides the next time she’ll take the drivers test is when the Hibiscus is budding in the spring. The author concludes the story this way because it relates Saeng to the flower. Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1 because the hibiscus is a connection to her old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can make it through the cold winter, she can too. She will take her drivers test as a sign of surviving and overcoming obstacles. In this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time. Saeng will adapt to the differences of @LOCATION1, the hibiscus will bloom; and Saeng will pass her drivers test."	3	3		3																					
10477	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph inorder to help the reader visualize a new beginning for the girl. A time to re-take the test and have the fresh new flowers to look upon. To watch the geese return. The geese are symbolic to her and the quest she had taken.. to her new home. The combination of the melting snow and the budding flowers lets the reader know of the bright fresh unclaimed future that is to come for the girl. The author uses the paragraph at the end inorder to explain more of what is to come, to enhance illustrations and capture the attentive audience. It is used to show a spirit in the girl. that allows us to see that she is like the flower, she is having trouble rooting/grasping on to the new lifestyle but there is always going to be a fresh/new time to continue on."	3	3		3																					
10484	4	"The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to show Saeng’s determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test her mother knew that it was hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn’t a good idea. Saeng is kindof comparing herself to the plant. she @MONTH1 have thought, if this plant can make it through the winter and still keep growing, than she can make it through the test. Therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did."	1	2		2																					
10485	4	"The author concludes  the story with this paragraph  because she has new hope and determination. The author loves and admires the hibiscus; for e xample “But it’s strong enough to make it through winter”, says her mother. Saeng wants to be able to deal with hardships just as strongly as the hibiscus can. She is filled with new resolution when she says to herself “Then i will take the test again.”     "	2	2		2																					
10488	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is about how the snow melts and the greenery returns, like a rebirth. This similizes his renew motivation to take the test again. This really shows how close he is to nature and the affect that his exposure to it has had on him over the years."	1	1		1																					
10489	4	"I think that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because this whole story was sweet and left a beautiful picture in your head with like about every sentence. So why not end it in paragraph like, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Now tell that wasn’t beautiful."	0	0		0																					
10491	4	He uses this line at the end of the story cause it shows she has anothe chance to pass the test. They use the plant cause a plant will always come back and bud again. This was also a good way to end the story because it shows now in the present plants @MONTH1 be a sign of inspiration and would teach you to look up to something. And maybe this is how she comunicotes with her mother through the plants.	1	2		2																					
10496	4	"The author concludes this as the last paragraph because of Two main reasons. One of them is the flower is almost like her in the being, the flower wasn't bloomed. But when the snow melts and the flower blooms she is like the flower and is going to try again to bloom out in passing the test Another reason is because it reminders her of bock home and her mother understands why she paid so much for it so they want to take core of it."	1	1		1																					
10499	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He concludes with this paragraph because that’s how the girl feel. She feel that in the spring she can do better then what she did.	1	1		1																					
10504	4	"The author concludes the story that way because one theme is to overcome obstacles. The hibiscus represents Saeng’s perseverence, and the last paragraph offers closure to the conflict that was introduced. The hibiscus is “strong enough to make ith through the cold months here… that is what matters,” this makes a connection between the plant and the author’s perseverence because of the symbolism. The last paragraph adds that symbolism with closure because she says she’ll wait until spring to take the test again.   "	3	2		3																					
10514	4	I think that the passage is trying to say the sum because in the passage. it says “in the spring when the snows melt and only the sun does that and the gees return hunting season and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again”.  so @CAPS1 start in the spring so it has to be the sun in the spring time.	0	0		0																					
10520	4	"The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows that you can allways start clean you should never give up when you realy want something. The daniter realy wanted to pass the test so she worked hard but she failed it. She knows like the plant spring will offer a new braining in life and you can always change something you dont like about yourself. I stongly agree with this statement because if you didn’t have a secound chance most people would all be losers because everyone makes mistakes, in there like and everyone has the over thniky to fix them. This is why I belive the author concludes this statement of the end of the story."	2	2		2																					
10523	4	"In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng’s determination to not only pass her driving test, but to accomidate to her new home. The author says “vowed” to express positive connotation in the paragraph. The author says, “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… familiar.” The author says this to show that she is adapting to her new lifestyle , yet he uses the last paragraph to say that she needs a little more time."	2	2		2																					
10524	4	"In the story, “winter Hibiscus saeng made a promise to herself that she would never fail the test again Saeng wanted to remember her past and homeland. That is why she bought the flowers. At the end of the story she vows,” In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She says this because she wants to move on now and try to get used to her new home."	2	1		2																					
10544	4	I think that the reason why the author concludes this paragraph in the story because he wanted to show the lone Saeng had for the geese.	0	0		0																					
10545	4	"There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, “Winter Hibiscus,” in the way that she did. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here…” is what Saeng’s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond. Also in the story ,the author states “…she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become…almost familiar to her now.” Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.  When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, its obvious that subconsciously, she saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time."	3	3		3																					
10552	4	I think they think it will bring them luck	1	1		1																					
10555	4	"The author concludes that statement because the geese move south in the winter and come back in the spring, Saeng has failed the test in the winter but she will retake it while the season of spring comes. As Saeng fails her driving test and she see the familiar plant means she will come back to take the test. The geese have left but will come back when the season is coming. So both the geese and Saeng have a reason to come back north or retake the test. The author adds the statement in the end because the geese's actions are just like Saeng."	2	2		2																					
10561	4	Next year around the winter time when she she have to plant things again she is going to be ready and this time she gone do it much better.	1	1		1																					
10573	4	"In the end of the story the girl Saeng vowes to herself that she will take the drivers test next year.One reason she @MONTH1 have vowed to herself to do that she would do that is to prove that she can pass the test. Also the flower after she bought it and planted it, and after she remembered all the good times she had in Vietnam it gave her the confidense to go out and get what she wanted."	1	2		2																					
10581	4	The reason the author concludes this story with the paragraph. The story is all about the girl missing her home country. This paragraph implies that the girl will adapted to her new country by the next @DATE1. The story and the paragraph show the girls strength to overcome. This this is why the author ended the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
10589	4	"Saeng in not only just dissappointed from failing her drivers test, she is also upset and missing her home of Vietnam. Walking home she spots a little piece of Vietnam right there in the united states. She buy the beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to remind her of her past. The end of this story combines the two different, countries, cultures and almost worlds her life is from. When she says, “when they come back”, she is referring to the geese. To her the geese symbolize her life  in life in @LOCATION2 and how she has became accustom to it. The hibiscus is also a symbol of her life. It is a symbol of her life and past in Vietnam.It brings back memories and buying that plant was like getting a little piece of home. When the “hibiscus is budding” then she will attempt the test again. When this little piece of home gets bigger then she will try again. When she is more stable in the @CAPS1 culture, get still has a firm grasp of her own, then she will be ready."	3	3		3																					
10592	4	"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her driver’s test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (“…and this hibiscus is budding…”), the author depicts Saeng’s change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driver’s test. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saeng’s new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination to the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saeng’s mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (“…when the snow melts and the geese return…”). This shows Saeng’s development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that Saeng undergoes."	3	3		3																					
10604	4	"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times. After Saeng buys the flower she vows to retake the failed drivers test after spring comes. Spring is a symbol of fresh start. Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in @LOCATION1. "	3	3		3																					
10606	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will return to the flowers again in the spring.	0	0		0																					
10607	4	"The author states that idea because if you can not do it once do it again. First, if you take a test and cant pass it the first time do it again and you will be able to pass. For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test so they could have let her take it again to see if she can pass it. Second, she could ask for help or use a book and study. For example, it will help you pass a lot easier if you study hard enough. That is what I think the statement means."	1	1		1																					
10617	4	The auther concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks that it will explain what happened to saeng very well.	0	0		0																					
10619	4	"The author is relating to that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well. So you can compare saeng to both the geese and hibiscus, because they too need time in a way for when they are ready to do what they do. In a way saeng has molded as one with both objects."	1	2		2																					
10620	4	"I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize’s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her."	2	1		2																					
10628	4	"The Author concludes that, when the geese come back she will take the test because she believes she will be more ready for the test then it will be easier in the spring. This will give her more time to learn & study & hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home. It will be easier to complete the drivers test in spring. She feels bad like she let her mother down for failing it, “I just stared at the hibiscus,” this tells that she felt to ashamed to even look at her mother. So next spring she wants to make her mom happy & pass cause she will be ready."	1	2		2

10630	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line “.. Slowly fading into the distance.” Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line “… Through the quiet repition of season upon season.”. This basically said that she just needed to get into routine and she will be able to do it."	1	2		2

Suddenly, we noticed that we were at the end of the line. So my mother said.” @CAPS1 get on another ride then”. We already tried the other rides,” my father said. So we stayed at the end of the line until it was our turn, and said that was the last ride, soon there were people behind us complaining, their younger children was getting mad, and parents was hollering. We just stood there, and kept being patient. That didn’t desterb us. since we were raised to be patient, and wait our turn at things. I feel being patient is very important, because if you act up in line, you might make people think they’re holding you up, but it’s the line moving slow. Advice: when you are waiting at the end of the line, don’t shout, scream, holler, or yell at anyone, it only creates trouble. Just don’t think about all of the people ahead of you, talk to someone, just take your mind off of it for a while, then you’ll notice, the line is moving quicker than you expected. P.S. We enjoyed the ride."	8	9		17				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	3

When @PERSON1 was born his dad was @NUM1 years old. @PERSON1 dad had already applied fro the army. His dad has been their most of his life. Two years later @CAPS1 sister, my best friend was born. Their dad was with them til @CAPS2 exie was about @NUM2 I believe, but he left that year. @PERSON1 new why his dad was gone, but @PERSON2 is about a year behind because she has really bad A.D.H.D. so doesn’t know why she didn’t see or talk to her dad for about three years. When she turned about six years old she knew her dad was gone and that was the time @PERSON1 became to be in the in the army and also it was the time their dad was in the leg by a machete. When their came back for about a year, they spent a lot of time with him, and @PERSON2 is very fragile and he would try play with her and tickle her and it hurt @PERSON2 and she would scream “@CAPS3! @CAPS3!” but it didn’t work he would just keep going and acting like he didn’t hear her. @PERSON1 isn’t fragile at all, he loves his dad and so does she but she doesn’t like him as a person. She likes my dad more than hers because she sees him more and she thinks hes nicer. In conclusion I think @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are very patient because they don’t know if they’ll ever see him again after he gets on that plane, and I’ve asked their mom and she says they never complain about missing their dad."	8	7		15				2	2	2	2			2	1	2	2

My patience was not very good. While I was waiting for my dad to hook the camper up to his truck I sat there very bored. I kept saying when are you going to be done? Or,when are we leaving? Everytime I got, just be patient hunny. So, I tried it wasn’t really working.We finally left, it was an hour drive and when your seven thats a very long time. I had nothing to do, I was bored out of my mind! So, I said “daddy when are we gonna be there?” I got later, just be patient. So I followed demands and went along with his idea. Once we got there the first thing I wanted to do was swim. So as my mom was getting her swimsut  on. I was so impatient I looked like I had ants in my pots. I was going to go knock of the bathroom door but, I didn’t I took what I had learnt earier and did it. I sat down and patiently waited for my mom. So throughout this I learned a big lesson on patience. If you are patient things will happen much faster. I still use this lesson today. But every one in a while everyone is a little impatient."	10	10		20				3	3	2	2			3	3	2	2

17938	7	"Patience is important in life. Something when you don’t have patience things tend to go wrong and that’s not always a good thing so here are somethings when you do not have patience. If you don’t have patience you can get into trouble. For example if you were in a long line for something and you couldn’t talk because if you did talk you would get in trouble. So if you didn’t have any patience you would probably say @CAPS1 my gosh this is taking forever. Then you would get in trouble for talking. Here is another reason why you should have patience. You should have patience for an example if you didn’t you would need patience if you were sick and you went to the doctors office and there was a really long line you would probably say for get it and then go home. So if you went home you would get even more sick and that would get even more sick and that would be bad. Finally, another reason on if you didn’t have patience. For example say you wanted to go the mall and bye a new pair of shoes. You went into the store and you found a pair that you liked and they fit just right. But when you went to go check out the cash regaster didn’t work so they had to call maitnence, to come and fix it and they told you that it would be an hour. So you sat and waited for twenty minutes but you did not have any patience so you said for get it and you left and didn’t get the shoes. Those were some people who didn’t have patience. But if they did that wouldn’t of happened to them because they would of waited or needed. Having patience is a good thing but not having it is not."	5	4		9				0	1	2	2			0	1	1	2

My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. ""@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside"", my mom had called out. ""Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside"" I said to my little brother. ""@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!"" he exclaimed. ""@CAPS3, but just one time"" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted ""I did it"" and I looked at him proudly and said ""good job"" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did!

18068	7	"Patience a helpful trait to get you through life. Being patient, waiting calmly or being content. A patient; A person usually waiting to see a doctor. There are many types of patient. Patient, a patient, or patience. Out there? I’m going to talk about two kinds. Probably not the two you would think. I am going to discuss a patient and being patient. Although there is no pun intended, I feel that they both remind me of a story. One cold, dreary morning I had to take a trip. Not a field trip, nor a vacation. A trip to the doctor’s office. Why did I need to? To get my yearly vaccine, that’s why. The morning probably wasn’t really cold. I was just nervous, when we arrived at the doctor’s office ,(which seemed like it was even far away) the office man even called me and my dad up to the front window. He said “I have an appointment for my son.” And the lady at the front window said “the @NUM1 appointment?’’ “@CAPS1 that’s the one” said my dad .” “Your son looks to be scheduled for, tetns vaccined” @CAPS2 then told us to have a seat. I waited patiently, reading my book. After a while I started to feel uncased. I was quite bored, finding myself playing with my fingers in my pockets. My dad likes making funny statements, so he told me “you know what? You’re a patient patient!” I laughed. My laughing was cut out by the doctor opening the door. Before knew it, I was getting a needle in my arm. After that, I was all good. But what I learnt was that being a patient patient, helped me stay calm while getting my vaccine. If I wasn’t so patient , it might’ve hurt. I learned an important lesson that day."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

Think about my story the next time you don’t wanna show patience, cause it might just pay off."	11	12		23				3	3	2	3			3	3	3	3

Well if you do you better listen and listen hard @CAPS16 I’m not going to say this twice; patience is a vurture. On my first day, I walked into @PERSON1’s class I sat next to a girl with wavy blond hair, sparkling blue eyes, and a genuine smile. “@CAPS2.” @CAPS3 said. “my name’s @CAPS4.” @CAPS3 said in a perky voice. “@CAPS2.” I said back. “I’m @CAPS6, but you can call me @CAPS1.” “@CAPS8, uh @CAPS1.” @CAPS4 replied. “@CAPS11 let me show you around.” “@CAPS12!” I answered back. @CAPS4 and I became fast friends,but when @CAPS3 introduced me to her friends they all made fun of me for having a boy’s name. @CAPS4 yelled at them, but I said @CAPS13 was @CAPS17. @CAPS4 just woulden’t let @CAPS13 go. Finally I said to her, “@CAPS13’s @CAPS17 @CAPS4! Just let me handle this.” “@CAPS15?” @CAPS3 asked crossing her arms and tapping her foot the way @CAPS3 did when @CAPS3 coulden’t do same thing. “@CAPS16 you just don’t have any patience!” I said, getting a little angry @CAPS3 coulden’t understand. “@CAPS17 be that way  @CAPS1!” @CAPS3 said storming out of the room. “@CAPS4 wait!” I cried but I hat to run after her. “@CAPS20, please you don’t get @CAPS13. You can’t keep getting mad at them for making fun of me. I know your trying to protect me, but its @CAPS17. Have you ever had of patience before?” I asked ready to run if @CAPS3 ran from me. “@CAPS21.” @CAPS3 said, looking down at the scuffed floor. Then, I told her everything I knew about @CAPS13 and we never had a problem again."	12	11		23				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	2

The windows were down in our car, and @CAPS1 and I were smelling burning rubber. @CAPS6 were in front of @LOCATION1, as @CAPS6 slowed down @LOCATION1 pulled to the side of us and told us to pull over. @CAPS6 pulled over @CAPS2 got out took one bok, and said “@CAPS6’re leaking trannie fluid.” @CAPS6 drove into town with @LOCATION1 following us. @CAPS6 stopped at an autin shop @CAPS6 were the only people there, the mucanic told us to get everything @CAPS6 needed out of the car. After @CAPS6 cleaned the car out, he pulled the car up onto thue lift and that when I saw the gradge for the first time. It smelled like gas everything was greasy and dirty (including the mucanics). “@CAPS7 is going to ruein our trip” I said to @CAPS2, “@CAPS6 don’t know that for sure” he replied. It was so hard to sit and be patient. I walked back and forth between the minny van and the gradge for about two hours. Some of the other mocanics came, too, but no one could find out what was wronge with our car. @CAPS2 got on the computer they had there and looked up car parts, it didn’t help. The day before @CAPS6 left @CAPS1 had taken her car to @CAPS10 gardge for a tune up. @CAPS6 weren’t sure. After sitting at the shop for about three hours I got hungry, so did every one else so @CAPS6 went to a restorunt across the street for loneh. @CAPS2 stay at the shop for a little while longer than the rest of us. At lunch @CAPS2 said “were going to have to call triple A to come pick up our car. @CAPS6 are going to have to go back home!! I was so upset, after all @CAPS7 waiting @CAPS6 have to go back home. On the way out of the restorant tripped and landed on my rist. I sprained my rist, so @CAPS6 went back across the street and behind the audio shop was a wallmart so @CAPS6 stopped there got a bandage for my wrist, and pick out a book to buy. I got the vampire diaries, @PERSON1 got a starwars book. @CAPS6 read them on the wag home in @CAPS12 car."	10	12		22				3	3	2	2			3	3	3	3								
18178	7	"Finally, all those months of waiting are coming to an end! My mother is going to give me a cell phone! Although it was her old one, it will be new to me, I’ll be able to talk to my friends whenever I want. I @MONTH1 not get the services I want, but at least I’ll have to stop worrying about being late for appointments. Like I said, the waiting is almost over. Okay, so I’m not the most patient person in the world, but this is worth it! You see, I’m going into track, cross-country, and choir. Since I ride the bus home and all of these activities end long after the buses leave, I need someone to pick me up. In order for that to happen, I need a cell phone. My mom said that first, I need to be thirteen. Second, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone. Last of all, I need to prove that I am deticated, I can keep my grades up, and that I am responsible enough to have one. I turned thirteen in @DATE1, she’s transferred everything, I’ve proved I’m deticated, I’ve kept my grades up, now I just have to prove that I am responsible. In order to do that, I’ve been watching the neighbor’s pets while they are away, mowed their lawns, helped babysit their grandchildren, and I’m working on cleaning the house and keeping it clean. So far, I’ve been able to persuade my dad and grandmother that I,m responsible. Even my brother and half-sister think I should have a cell phone! But my mum still isn’t sure. I think that if I can clean half of the house and keep it clean until @CAPS1, she will finally give me her old cell phone. I’ll probably have to clean up the mess after @CAPS1 too though. When I get a cell phone, I’ll have to continue everything I’m doing now. So, I won’t be off the hook or anything, but I will have a little more freedom! I still have a long ways to go but it will all be worth it in the end. I will finally have my own cell phone!"	11	11		22				3	3	2	3			3	3	2	3

I took my time to plan what I was going to write about. We had lots of time so you shoud use the most of your time to make everything good. To do this you have to be patient with yourself. This means that you should look over your answers again and make sure you have it correct. When I done with the writing section, I went over it to make sure I had everything right. I had plenty of time. When I was done correcting my work I waited for everyone else to be done as well by reading. That was the time when I was patient."	11	12		23				3	3	2	3			3	3	3	3

Patience is self respecting, kind fair and not self seeking. Patience is respect not disrespect, patience has no evil, paticence does not boast. Patience does not lie, it makes things better when they are difficulty. It makes it easier to focus and do things better. It helps to wait for things."	5	6		11				0	1	2	2			0	1	2	3

After that we knew the deer would not come out but we were wrong, about @NUM2 minutes later we saw a deer. And we watched it till it came to shoting range.

And my brother waited for it to turn around because his head was faceing the other way and right when it was in perfect view he shot. The arrow shot out like a bulet coming out of a gun. The arrow didn’t hit him it went about @NUM4 foot away from the deer. The deer heard the arrow launch and ran. We waited to hope that there were any other deer coming but we didn’t see any so my brother and I cleaned up our blind. And we luged everything back to the car. When we got home everybody was waiting at the door. But we told them that we didn’t get one.

And all the doctor wanted to know is how I broke my foot. So then we had to wait for the nurse to come back in and put a cast on. And that also took a long time, because first they have to put like five layers of cloth on it then they put like two layers of the cast thing on then I had to wait for it to dry.

18304	7	Do you know anybody who was and still is patient? Everyone was and most likely is till patient. Some people learn how to have a good patience by learning from an elder or some model. Being patient can sometimes be a big pain! You have to know how to have a good attitude even when you are in a very bad mood. Having patience is a good thing to have because you well for sure be good with kids of all ages. Work very good with moody people. Patience also has to work with listening or respect. You might have a child who doesn’t listen very well so you have to have some patience with that so they listen. I f someone doesn’t have very good respect for people it well take patience to work with them so they can have good respect! In summary patience is one way element to life.	7	6		13				0	2	2	3			0	2	2	2

But he keeps saying that “@CAPS1 are proof of aliens.” @CAPS2 my brother never lies to someone and always will have your back. If anyone says something about that isn’t true he will defend you. He says, “its not cool when somebody else talks about another person, all that means is that person has insu??? My brother never lets anyone talk about me without saying anything back.  One last thing is that my brother stays true to himself. He never tries to be someone hes not. He said, “I tried being someone im not and its not me. Im a nerd with street smarts, I mean I still watering carbons.” In conclusion, my brother is a loyal person for the simple fact he stands up for whatever he believes. Even if its alien, ??? or himself."	8	8		16				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2

I had my camera and I'm very thorough at getting a shot of @CAPS2.  My mother and the others were very patient with me, letting me be slow on the hike. The thing about @PERSON1 is that there aren't very many trail maps so you can easily become confused or lost. After hiking a long way we come to a folk in the road where a map was. My mother checked her cell phone and told us we had forty-five minutes until we had to take our new kitten to the vet. I suggested we start heading back so we could get home in time to pick up the kitten and arrive on time, permitting the long drive to the vets. My mother instead of taking my advice, started us off in the completely different direction. My sister and her friend complained dragging their feet. For the next mile or so we continued without finding a map. My sister and I became increasingly frustrated with my mother and with being lost. Because we had gotten lost in the monotonous field and trees my mother had to get out her dying cell phone and call my father to bring my kitten to the vet. I was looking forward to taking him, making me further stressed. Finally after another half hour of walking we ended up at the exit.

18538	7	"Patience in my words is to be able to wait along time for something and not angry and not raise your blood pressure. Patience is a good thing to have because if you didn’t have patience you would probably never be able to accomplish anything that takes time to do. I think that being patiente would help you succeed in many things. For an example, me and my mom were in the @ORGANIZATION1 drive thruogh and the lady in front of us was yelling at the people in the line to go faster, when you do something like that it’s most likely not gonna speed up. My mom has outstanding patience because she can wait for things for hours and not get frustrated. I rarely have patience I cant wait more than around ten minutes for something. Patience is a great thing because you must likely wan’t get things done. Most of my family and I don’t have the best patience but we sometimes do. I think that patience is very good to have."	6	12		18				1	1	2	2			3	3	3	3

18552	7	Some times when people take a long time my family is patent. My dad has to be patient because when he gets deployed to a new country he has to wait such a long time to come back and see his family again. My mom has to be patient because sometimes her co-workers or even the people there really get on her nerves. My brother has to be patient because he always has something in the mail that has always waiting for. My sister is patient because she has to handle both me and my brother. Both me and my brother are patient because we have to sit on an hour long bus ride to have with nothing to do but sit there and look bored. My siblings are also patient and wait for the school year to end. My dad is also patient because he has to finish his baits dects which is takeing a long time plus all the whineing from my sister and mom about why we don't need one. I'm  always patient when I have to got the school day over with my brother can be patient when he has to sit and wait for about thirty minutes at a time for his computer to load.

My mom probably could’ve filled three two gigabite memory cards in that time. It was so boreing. After it had been about twenty minutes they finally let us on to the field. We all walked through the outfield and onto the infield. Most of us were on live t.v. I was one of them. When the game was done most people walked away sad but I walked away happy and sad. People were sad because the @ORGANIZATION1 lost the game. The reason I was happy though is because I got to go onto the field."	8	9		17				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	3

You could hear the screams from a mile away overweight people were wearing shorts and tank-tops, eating popcorn. It was brutal! I had riden every ride except for the dragster. The dragster is the ride that takes you up to the very top and shoots you down as fast as a bullet. The only problem, if you wanted first cart, which @CAPS3 did, it was a three and a half hour wait! “@CAPS1 can @CAPS3 just go ride the skyscraper again” I pleaded. “@CAPS2! @CAPS3 came all the way to @LOCATION1; @CAPS3 are not going to leave without riding the best funnest ride! You are going to stand in this line and wait!” @CAPS1 quickly replied. “@CAPS5! I never get what I want do I!” “You get everything you want. You can go ride the skyscraper again if you want but I am staying here! And I feel bad for whoever has to sit by you because they are going to have bruises and scratches all over the arms.

The teacher gave us home work (h.w.) and I did not understand a part. The teacher was helping a different person so I waited. I skipped the part came back by then the teacher could help me. Then I understood the homework. My mom took me to her job after school or I would have alone at home. While waiting I mopped the floor. I rested my head and put it on the table.

I was cold, bord, and hungry, but at least I didn’t have my arm being pulled off. “Are you sure?” I felt so bad, @LOCATION1 was my dog, I should be holding him. Which was @CAPS4 easy task. “@CAPS5!” @CAPS7 says lightly, “I got it!” @LOCATION1 pulls her again and @CAPS7 falls into me. I catch her, and @CAPS7 mumbles a sorry. I had, but I still think I should take him. All day I’ve been complaining. I was joking about our luck with the weather partly, but mostly, I just wanted to start a conversation. “I think my hands are numb” I say joining them into my pockets. “@CAPS6, at least it’s not raining, like the weather man said, “@CAPS7 smiles, and I smile back. A voice booms out of the specker, “@CAPS8 walkers. Lets get moveing!” I glare at @PERSON1 and ask one more time, “Do you want me to take him!” @CAPS7 pats my back and says slowly, “I got it.”"	8	12		20				2	2	2	2			3	3	3	3

He was just a little baby, so I knew that if he started crying, or got upset that I coudn't get frustrated with him because he's a baby. There were times when he would start crying for no apparent reason and I just wanted to scream, @CAPS1, I knew I couldn't and that I just had to be patient with him. I also knew that I couldn't get upset, or angry because it might make it even worse for him, so I had to be patient and wait for him to stop crying and for me to calm down before I could go anywhere near him. I was understanding and tolerant and I didn't lose my patience. Practicing that skill is very important. I am proud of myself and being able to keep my composure in crazy or chaotic situations like that, and not loosine my cool, or patience, with him or anyone else."	8	9		17				1	2	2	3			2	2	2	3

My bus driver @PERSON1 mede me sit in the back because she said I talked too much and that I wasn’t aloud to talk the whole ride home. It was hard at first but then I did my homework. Which gave me something to do. That was one time I was patient but not the only time. Another time when I was patient was standing in line for a rollercoaster at cedar paint. The beginning of the line said that it was a @NUM1 hour wait but we didn’t care because it was my friend’s and my favorite ride, it wasn’t so bad because it’s all worth it when you ride the ride.

18713	7	"I think patience is the ability to be quiet and wait at the same time. For example, patience is required for everyday tasks like waiting in line for lunch, waiting for someone to pick you up, waiting for your doctor to examine you. I need to use patience almost @NUM1 times a day. First I need to be patient for my mom to drive me to school. I also have to be patient for the class assignment to passed out, for class to be over, for lunch to start, for night to come etc.I hear people say that patience is a virtue. I didn’t even know that means, but if I’m patient I’ll probably find out. So my conclusion is, patience is required, and people use it everyday. I think patience is a gift and I enjoy it."	8	4		12				0	3	3	2			0	1	1	2

I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. That was the game cube. Also we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patiente to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and couldn’t wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didn’t complain I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I was still not complained. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it.

When you sprang your ankle it hurts a lot. After is prang it l had to go to the doctor witch as all ways you have to wait forever, but sometimes its worth it. Once you get in the nurse asked you a few questions then you have to wait even more now @CAPS1! But atleast you eventually find out whats wrong, after the doctors came in they had to take x-rays witch took a while to develop. but I finally got them back and discover it was only a sprang.

I threw @CAPS3 up again, and hit @CAPS3 as hard I could. “@CAPS1 last serve” I thought, “please be over.” I watched as the round, white ball soared through the thin air. When @CAPS3 got near the net, I seemed as if gravity suddenly took affect. The ball droped down at hit the net and rolled off of @CAPS3. @CAPS3 didn’t make @CAPS3 over. I felt cool wind brush against @CAPS1 sweaty face. As the coches decided what team we would be on, I sat on the damp grass. Finally, they handed me a small, white envelope, I breathed in and out slowly. I could feel @CAPS1 stomach tie into one giant knot. I had been waiting for this moment for months. I reached @CAPS1 sweaty hand in the envelope. I was getting more nervos by the second. I slowly slid the piece of paper out of the envelope. I heard one girl scream in ecxitement. Finally I was got to find out weather I was on the A team, @CAPS2 team or getting cut. @CAPS3 felt as if the world depended on @CAPS3. I felt a ruch of relief and excitment when I saw the sight of the word “congradulations.” @CAPS3 the sight of those words I pulled out the rest of the letter, “you have made the @CAPS2 team.” I suddenly had a feeling of mixed emotions racing through @CAPS1 body. I desided to just be happy. I went around congratulating everyone who had made a team, and hugging the ones who didn’t. After all this time I finally knew. @CAPS3 made me happy to know that I tryed something and had to wait to know if I succseded or not.

18892	7	"Patience is one of the worlds most important lifeskills. Having my best friend live across the street is great. He has @NUM1 older sister, named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 was blessed with downs syndrom. This basically means she doesn’t understand things as fast as you and I. You also can see it from the way she acts. @LOCATION1 is one of the happiest people I have ever met. Knowing @LOCATION1 as well as I do also comes with a downside. You need to be extremely patient. When talking to her, lots of people would give up and leave because she doesn’t get it, but her closest friends have developed patient like no other kind. Having @LOCATION1 as my neighbor is one of the greatest things that could have happened. She has made me a master at one of the most important lifeskills. @LOCATION1 is a wonderful person and, I guess a great teacher, but when you are having a bad day, be grateful because not everyone is as blessed as you."	8	9		17				2	2	2	2			0	3	3	3

My dad expects people to be on time within a couple of minutes. When ever I say come pick me up mat seven o’clock, he will be there by seven o’clock.

So when we got there, there was a pool! We went up to our room and got changed into our bathing suits, we went down to the pool, found a spot, and put our towels there. But, everyone had to get out for chemical cleaning. I was burning up with anger and disappointment, but I cooled down and waited. Waited, and waited and waited, still no one could go in. It had been about fifteen minutes so far and everyone was bored out of their minds. And finally a buzzing noise ringed in y ears! But it meant that some food was ready at the snack bar, so it get my hopes up but they fell down again. Waiting, still waiting then a voice said, “ok, everyone back in the pool.” I was overjoyed by these words, and I ran then jumped right in!

I was clearly not, because a four minutes later, I have this thing on front of me. So, I started out by thinking about the time I used patience. This time was good as any. Now don’t get me wrong, I understand why we take the @CAPS1, to…uh, I think it’s to help us learn, or make our hands hurt and cramp up, I don’t know, really. Writing about patience is very hard because you can lose it very fast. But the @CAPS1 is the @CAPS1, and I think to so my best, so the story must go on! It’s very quiet in here, and the smell of pencil and paper are very long. My eyes are tired, and I can’t help but to let out a mighty roar of a yawn. My hand is asleep and every second, you hear a “sniff”, “sniff”, “sniff”… “sniff”, “snot. We’re not aloud to get up, so we’re stuck “sniff”, “sniff”, snot”-ing  all hour long. When you we’re a kid, whoever is grading this, did you ever take this test, or a section of it? Well, it’s none of my business, never mind. Ou! My hand really hurts! One second, (shake, shake, shake, crack) there, that’s better. Patience is a virtue, but who cares. You probably don’t have the patience to read this so let me finish by saying this… writing about patience, but now, I’m done. (yes!)"	8	11		19				1	1	3	3			2	3	3	3

My cousin @PERSON2, who is only around @NUM1, does anything you say. She’s an easy one to babysit. But my other cousin, @PERSON3 he has to go by his own agenda. Not that I don’t love him, just that I think he has to be one of the hardest little kid to ba bysit. We started off pretty good that morning. we had a snack, played in the room for a while, did some arts & crafts, and watched a movie. A few hours before my aunt was supposed to come home, @PERSON1 went poopie in her diaper. Now, I’ve dealt with a lot of poopie diapers before, @CAPS4 I wasn’t too worried. I set @PERSON1 on the changing table, and took her diaper off before I realized that I didn’t have any wipes. I asked @PERSON4 where they were, but he was playing with those milk pumping bottle things. “@PERSON4, I need you to go get wipes please. Now.” @PERSON1 was now squirming, and I had to hold on to her if I didn’t want poop all over the house. “I know, but I can’t” “well why can’t you?” “@CAPS1 I don’t want to.” I was started to lose my temper when I realized the saying “patcience is a virtue.” I took a deep breath and I realized I was feeling what patient must feel like. “@PERSON4 I’ll bet you can’t go get them as fast as a cheetah!” “@CAPS2 I can!” “@CAPS3, prove it.” @CAPS4 he did.

My cousin was impatient that day because she wanted to go home. I think that patient will help you go through life. For an example if you were going out with your friend and she was driving and you got tired and wanted to go home and said lets go. Then you were the one that was impatient because she was the one driving. Patience will always be one of the things we have to do. If you be patient you could do things much better. You have to sometime wait for mangers to call you to get the next job applied for. But can't be impatient or you won't get hired for that job. You always have to be patient because you don't know what would happen if you didn't be patient.	6	6		12				1	1	2	2			1	1	2	2

I learned patience when waiting and being, but it`s something we have to do."	10	7		17				2	3	2	3			0	2	2	3								
19031	7	"One day my mom came home from work. She came in and said “@CAPS1, do you want to go shopping for your clothes @CAPS2 or later?” I chose @CAPS2. So my mom changed her clothes and we were off to the store. It was around @NUM1 so it was rush hour. It seemed like it was taking forever and I was getting mad. Then my mom said be patient and it will be over soon. This is a time when I was patient. After ten minutes, things started to clear up. It still took a while but it was getting better. In less than twenty minutes we were pulling up in the @LOCATION1 parking lot. There was a few cars in the lot but it didn’t seem like much. When we got into the store that’s when I really was mad. The lines for you to purchase your items lead all the way to the back of the store. Then my mom said “@CAPS2 look. The lines are long as you can see. Are you sure you can handle this and have patients?” “I’ll try”. I said. After we got in the store we were looking for my clothes, we were looking at the long lines also, to see if they went down some. We got my clothes, then got in line. We spent about an hour worth of time in the line and it made me mad. Not only did it make me mad, it made me hurgy because I skipped lunch. When we got out of the store, we were happy and hungry. We left the store and went to @CAPS3.Donalds. When we were down the street from @ORGANIZATION1, there was this traphic line we got closer and closer to @ORGANIZATION1 and then realized that line was the @ORGANIZATION1 line. We got in the lot and I knew for sure that I was going to have more patients. So we waited and the line went really fast. We got up to the spoorker and my mom ordered a fish sandwich for her and a chicken sandwich for me. We got to the next window and they gave us our food. When we got our food, the lady said “@CAPS4 you for your patients”. Then she asked us would we like a free frie of any size for our wait. We told her yes and we will take a large frie. My mom turn to me and said “Do you see what happens if you be patient?” I said yeah and patients is a good thing to have. That was a time when I was patient."	10	11		21				2	3	2	3			3	3	3	2								
19037	7	My grandma was patient for @NUM1 months because she had a big check that kept haveiry mastakes with it like they spelled her last name wrong so it had to be called back and retiped everytime they retipped it they would make a mastakes five times in a row and it takes a long time to prosses and we needed to pay our pills so we wouldn’t get kicked out. We also needed a new car and clothes. Our car ready to break down and our clothes we out grow. When my grandma finally got her check we went strait out and got a brand new car. and clothes. I think my grandma was pretty patient after they had to re do it over five time I know it wouldn’t be able to be that patient without loseing  it.	8	8		16				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2								
19044	7	Patience every knows what it is and how we all can stay focus is like if were waiting at a unemployed line we wait cause patient keeps us from getting angry but if were waiting for a long time that’s a better chance of getting angry. When you wait you also show care that you know someones in front of you and you wait wait wait til its your turn cause waiting and being patient lets you absorve the things around you and look at things you never seen before in your whole life and stuay what you saw to see what it is even if you already know it when your patience you show gradatude to the person in front of you and gradatude shows respect and trust wortiness that’s a way of being polite and patience to the person in front of you. When you patience you don’t have to rush anything cause you have a lot of time and you shouldn’t complaine at all when you are or are trying to be patient no matter how long your patient the maximum time is for you and you bring up that time faster by not being patient and patient is a big thing cause patient gives you want you want or need in a lot of time I think patience is important because you never know whos patient to you so you should be patient to someone else.	4	3		7				0	1	2	1			0	1	1	1

Oh, did I mention I ‘m daddy’s little girl? I think you could’ve figure out that my brother was  the one that got in trouble @CAPS4 had so much patience  by being tolerant during @CAPS3 those  things, well , @CAPS2 the and, @CAPS4 got cracked by my dad, and so did my fingers. @CAPS2 least I never got in trouble.

I wasn’t thinking of my birthday party, my cake or ice cream, no I was thinking of getting the money, first present no money. Second present, yes, there was money. And so on until I got to the last present. It was a card so it had to have money in it. I couldn’t wait until I could buy something with it. How does being patient the into this, well I had to wait, and wait, and wait. It took nearly five whole months! Could you believe??? so much there ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???, and have to wait that long? Well, anyways it payed off. When I finaly got it I couldn’t believe it. It was the best thing in the whole world.

I think that I was really patient when I got back from a trip, with my friend to @LOCATION1. I was waiting on the airport for my dad to come and pick me up and I was so exited!you see I had been gone for two weeks and I was really homesick.

There was one @CAPS2 in life when I was patient. Yay! Yag! My mom is taking my friends and I to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I called many friends, and told them if they wanted to go.  Meanwhile, we packed up some water bottles and hopped into the can. We were all looking out the window. OMG! Look at those big roller coasters. One of my friends shouted out. There we were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2; the first ride I saw was the @CAPS3. The highest and fastest roller coaster there well, it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. So we were all talking about it, then we decided to go on it. Wow! The line is huge. We all said. I shouted out its ok, I heard its an awesome ride lets just all be patient. Meanwhile, we waited and waited, until we were finally the next people to ride. We went on the ride, and then all of a sudden the ride start, we didn’t know and it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. We waited about two hours but it was worth it. In conclusion, I really do think that being patient is a good thing in life, even if it takes hours.

19247	7	In my opinion being patient is when your waiting your turn for some thing. And being impatient means not writing your turn. In your whole life you have patientence because sometimes you might just have to wait. I have patience and I know a lot of people who have patience to. I was raised to have patience when your doing something don’t rush because you can mess up. Don’t go way to slow because then people will think you don’t know how to do it. You can just go at your paste so you can get it done right and the way you want to. People who don’t have patience aren’t always happy all the time.	5	8		13				0	1	2	2			2	2	2	2

It also means you can go through tough times without complaining. Every year I’m not that patient, and every year we go to @LOCATION1. We go @LOCATION1 for labor day, to walk the bridge. The rule is, if you don’t  complain you get fudge. I thought I wasn’t gonna get fudge, because I had pulled muscles in both my legs and the night before embers burnt my legs. I knew that to get fudge I had to be patient. So I got dressed, walked to the bridge, and gathered up all my confidence and patience and started the mighty walk. Every year we try and beat our bridge walking time and I thought my legs would slow us down. So I told myself “be patient” over and over and then I sped up going past the first three miles in @NUM1 minutes, (because my legs were worn out). I knew to beat out record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I thought we could and my legs felt like @CAPS3 were ready to burst!

Thanks to patience I got delicious fudge and we beat our record. That’s a time I’ll never forget, because I had patience and I kept going until I crossed the finish line.

For example, I had to give my mom @NUM1, but I did not have the @NUM1 write then and there my mom did not complain she waited she had patience. Patience does not mean you keep beging. It means that you are understanding and tolerant. If your dad said he is going to give you some pizza, have patience and wait on that pizza. When you have patience people will have patience with you. For example if you was waching tv and you did not want to get up yet people will have patience and wait for you to get up. Patience does   not mean you keep asking. For example I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 beging my mom for candy not knowing if I had patience a waited on her answer I would get the candy, but I didn't.

Following that they told @LOCATION1 how Hindenburg by fire in 1937 which used hydrogen. They realized if this had happen in a urban area it could have been worse. Anthore obstacle they faced was the wind. If the dirigible was parked at mooring mast the violent wind speeds would make the Blimp shift and cause strees on the building steel frame. The greatest obstacle was the law passed. The law stated that no airships could fly to low in urban areas. This would keep blimps from landing there.	3	3		3																					
14864	6	"While building the Empire State Building, workers faced many obstactles while attempting for dirigibles to dock there. A dirigible attached to the mast and building would add extra stress, so builders instead had to over sixty thousand dollars worth of reconstructions to fix the buldings framework. Dirigibles also dock with a line running from the front of the ship to the mast, and while they planned for the blimp to be able to sway in the wind, it was unrealistic that any ship could attach to the building at the high winds.Other obstacles they faced in letting dirigibles dock the building, was because of the safety hazards, the hydrogen used in most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. is highly flammable. Builders also did not take into consideration the pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas, so it was illegal for a dirigible to tie to the building. The task of having dirigibles attach to the Empire State building was an impossible task to begin with. "	3	4		4

The mere size of this glimpse was astounding and this created many problems. Firstly The wind atop a skyscrapper is great and inconsitent. It is extremely difficult to dock to a building a seen when the Los Angeles tried to dock in @DATE1. The balloon was unable to dock due to potential damage it could cause to itself and the surrounding city. The blimps were also kept afloat by Hydrogen which due to its chemical nature is extremly flamable. Blimps had exploded in the past such as the Hindenburg. Engineers knew that if a similar accident occurred at the Empire state Building, substantial damage would have been done to the city and building itself.

Furthermore, there were laws that limited how low a dirigible could fly over urban areas, so it would be illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building because it would be too low.

A one thousand-foot dirigible held by only a single winch would be to heavy for the buildings frame. In order for it to work it would have to be strengthened to accommodate the one thousand foot dirigibles. This would be a process worth over sixty thousand dollars, just for the framework. Another obstacle was safety. Dirigibles out of the United States contained helium meaning it was highly flammable.

14941	6	"There are many things in life that seem like they could be brilliant ideas but, in reality there are many flaws with it. One of these ideas is using the Empire State building as a mooring mast for dirigibles. This is what Al Smith, the governor of New York at the time, discovers in an excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted. In this excerpt the builders of the Empire State building had to face some serious obstacles to allow the docking of dirigibles: @CAPS1 building the Empire State building many of the blue prints had to be changed. One thing that had to be changed was the skeleton of the building. They needed a way to support the drigibles if they were to dock. The skeleton they had in place put too much stress on the top half of the building that it would result in breaking. Another thing that the builders had to deal with was the safety of the @LOCATION1. If the highly flamable helium inside the dirigibles then it would be putting thousands of peoples lives in jeopardy. Finally the builders had to deal with the violently shifting winds. This too put stress on the frame of the building since the winds were so strong there and also a fear that it would blow the blimp into the pointed mast and break the blimp. Overall there are many reasons why the Mooring Mast never became a reality."	3	2		3																					
14942	6	"The idea of docking dirigables on top of The Empire State Building was a grand one It seems as though the dream of dirigable transportation was on it's way up, however, the architects were blinded by their excitement. Al @CAPS1 competitive nature not only pushed the building to a un-precedented 1,250 ft., but also combined transportation in new, fashionable, And effective ways. This not only made the public and architects excited, but also put a lot of expectations on the building. Al Smith did not see all the obstacles ahead that would halt his dirigible plans. One of the obstacles being that the swaying of the dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building, though the necessary precautions were made, the obstacle was foreshadowing the others to come. When the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the hydrogen gas, people became skepticle. What if it were to blowup over a crowded New York city street? Also, an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas prohibited the dirigable plans. The obstacles proved too much for the plan to go through. Though the plans were merely postponed by the late 1930's the idea of dirigables a top the Empire State Building had disappeared."	3	3		3

Although the idea to dock dirigibles to the building sounded good many things could of gone wrong. The Empire State building was a enormous structure for it's time, even though it looked ideal for the mast to go on ""winds""  would be too dangerous for even the most skilled pilots to menuver the dirigibles. Also most of the dirigibles from other countrys such as @LOCATION2 used ""hydrogen"" in their blimps. Although the dirigibles were ""hailed"" as the transportation of the future, too many safety precautions had to be taken because of the densely populated area of New York City. For the dirigibles at the time they were a sound and good idea for transportation, but even though the structure of the Empire State building lookd good they still had to be care ful with the building and the people below, and for the German hydrogen filled blimps were not good terms of safety over a populated city."	3	3		3																					
14954	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One being the changes in wind current. The dirigibles did have steering systems, and could be tethered however the wind could overpower these systems causing it to loose controll and crash. Another obstacle was the fear of another ""Hindenburg"" accident. On May 6, 1937, the hinden burg (a dirigible) that, like all other dirigibles, contained hydrogen (a highly flamible gas) was ignited and burned down, keeping the casualties mainly to the men and women on board, however, if this incident happened above the highly populated @CAPS1.Y.C. the number of deaths would increase due to the pedestrians below."	2	2		2

In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it says ""The steel Frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This shows that at first the building was not strong enough to hold such weight. Another problem was nature. The workers had to take nature into effect. If they had a dirigible or a blimp up there the wind could potentially harm the dirigible. There was also a law in place that for bid aircraft to fly that low. Finally, workers had to make the height exceed any other height that was taller. In @CAPS1 @NUM2 says ""In December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire... would reach 1,250 feet..."" John Tauranac also followed by saying ""Their top they said would serve a highe calling.""

14967	6	"When the idea of making a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building was thought of, builders did not realize the obstacles that would have to be passed. One obstacle was ""nature itself. The winds, on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This means that if a dirigible were to be tied up for loading and unloading, it could be moved around freely in the sky, making it dangerous for passengers to be on or around it. An example of the dangerous winds would be in 1930, the ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. A concern for safety was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.""

The mast, which towered at over @NUM1 feet tall, would have stressed the steel frame of the Building, making its foundation weaker. To hold the mast, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This meant that the builders had to really think through the process of how they were going to get the mast to not bend the steel frame. Another obstacle the builders faced was a new law that forbid airships from flying too low over urban areas, such as New York. Therefore, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the Building or even approach the area. ""Because of this law, the mast was very rarely used. Regardless of what they tried, the builders would have to make big changes to the Empire State Building's framework in order to have the mast. However, the new law prevented airships from docking there, so the mast was not used as often as originally projected.

As described in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held on by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.""

Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast."" Safety was clearly the biggest concern"	3	3		3																					
15057	6	"During the @DATE1's technology and engineering wasn't quite as advanced. So it's safe to say builders of the Empire State Building had so obstacles. One of them were, how were they going to dock the dirigible safely and keep them stable, they had know idea. They did have the knowledge or technology to do such a thing back then."	1	0		1																					
15061	6	The builders of the Empire state building faced obstacles in order to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was that the winds at the top of the building were very dramicaclly shifting because of the air currents. Because of this the Dirigible end would swivlle around the top of the building. An other issue was the people walking the @CAPS1 of New York below the building. To stop a Dirigible heavy lead weights had to be used. This was problamatic because one of the weights could very easily come lose and @DATE1. The law that was about a flying airship lingering too low over a city would be broken if a Dirigible had been stationd at the Empire State building.	3	3		3																					
15065	6	"In The Mooring Mast builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles the builders faced were that they realized hydrogen was very flammable. An example from the excerpt is a German dirigible was caught on fire, the builders then thought how much worse it would of been over a densely populated area. Another obstacle was the use of the mooring mast. The winds at the top of the building were harsh, and made it hard for landing. It was also a law that airships could not fly low over urban areas. The builders of the Empire State Building then decided not to use the mooring mast for dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
15075	6	"The obstacles the builders had to face where rational, but there are some things you sould think of first, such as peoples safty, aircraft hight limets, and wind. They they thought about how to dock it, How to get the passengers safly to the landing area. What they did work on was smart though, they had the the thing that connects the dirigibles to the dock, the electric winch. They had a baggage, and ticket area. What they thought of was smart, but the other stuff first."	1	1		1																					
15082	6	"The original plan for the Empire State Building was to be tallest building in the world, at @NUM1 feet. Everything was going well until the competition. The Chrysler Building, threatened to steal the title. When Al Smith announced that he was going to but a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, this obviously changed the architects designs. ""The architects desighned a shiny glass & chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back desighn that imitated the overall shape of the building. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners... and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm."" (Lüsted). Two months after the workers started with the new plan, the celebrated because the finished framing the entire building ""The Empire State building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was safety."" (Lüsted)"	4	1		1																					
15089	6	"As the Empire State Building was being built to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there, the workers faced several problems in trying to accomplish this. The first of these obstacles to occurr to the workers was the framework of the building. The building needed to be sturdy enough for the blimp to dock there with the harsh winds constantly pushing the blimb in different directions. Without the proper frame work, it would be extremely dangerous to dock. The next obstacle for docking was the hydrogen gas powering the dirigibles. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and there had been other previous accidents with hydrogen blimps. The workers realized that an accident with exploding blimps would be very dangerous in a such ""densely populated area."" The final obstacle workers faced was the harsh wind currents at that altitude. The winds were so strong, that the blimps could not even get close enough to dock. The workers suggested weighting down the blimp would lead weights, but seeing as the weights ""would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" it ""was neither practical nor safe."" Trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea. As time went on the obstacles preventing this became to great and finally shut down the idea.

15092	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was lack of suitable landing area; ""so were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City."" Another obstacle was the wieght of a mooring mast. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened,"" which means they would have to modify the whole frame to bare the weight of the mooring mast which would cost over sixty thousand dollars.Safety was also an issue. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, so if it caught fire over a highly populated area such as downtown New York than the accident would be much worse. Another issue was the fact that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Because of the wind the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast."	3	4		3																					
15098	6	"When constructing a building, workers will face tough obstacles, ecspecially when it comes to building the Empire State Building. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, Al Smith and other architectural builders faced many problems. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building because there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Also, as stated in paragraph @NUM2, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Both of these obstacles were reasons that explain the failure of the mooring mast. The builders were not successful at their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."	2	2		2																					
15101	6	"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast,"" many obstacles created problems for the builders of the Empire State building and their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle that came across the builder's minds was that they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof,"" (paragraph @NUM1) because it would damage the building with the ammount of pressure pulling on the structure. The second problem that the architects faced was safety. Events from the past such as Hindenburg was caused by the use of ""hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable...the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse the accident could've been."" The next problem that came up was nature itself, such as dangerous winds. An event when ""the U.S. Navy dirigible, Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 there were legal issues, and existing law was against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal."	4	4		4																					
15102	6	"The builders of the Empire state building faced the problem of how to keep the back end of the blimp from swaying in the wind. They were unable to solve this problem, as we see in paragraph @NUM1 where it says: ""Even if the derigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem with docking blimps on the Empire State building was a law that stopped dirigibles from flying too low over populated areas. There is proof of this in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" One more problem with mooring dirigibles on the Empire State was that it was hard for pilots to dock their ships on the mooring. An example of this is in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."""	3	3		3																					
15109	6	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders faced while attempting to build the dirigible dock at the Empire State Building were: finding a way to make this building bigger than the Chrysler Building, Designing the mast and @CAPS1 the reality. Al Smith needed a way to make is building bigger than the Chrysler building. He came up with the idea with putting a mooring mast on the building. The idea seemed great. While designing the mast, architects realized they can't just place the mast right on top of the building. They'd have to modify the foundation. After changing the skeleton of the building, construction went on as planned. Two month later the mast was finished, but the architects forgot that most dirigibles use hydrogen which is highly flammable. All the work the architects put in was for nothing because the mooring mast was never used."	2	2		2																					
15115	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main obstacle was that the builders couldn't @CAPS1 put the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, because it had a flat roof. The mooring mast would put pressure on the building's fram. To overcome this obstacle the architects had to modify and strengthen the frame. More than sixty thousand dollars' went into the modifications of the framework. The greatest obstacle though was nature, and there was nothing the builders could do about that. The violent air currents caused winds on the top of the building to constantly shift. In open fields dirigibles could be weighted down in the back using led weights, but with pedestrians around it wouldn't be practical nor safe. Without being weighted down the dirigibles would swivel around."	3	3		3																					
15116	6	"In constructing the Empire State Building, builders faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop the @CAPS1. One obstacle that constructors faced was modifications, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation."" With this obstacale contractors would need to reinforce the @CAPS1 of the frame and the foundation. And the obstacle as stated from the excerpt is ""most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, which is flammable."" @CAPS2 that hydrogen is flammable it would not be good if a dirigible exploded over the streets of New York. Those are the obstacles contractors faced during the construction of the Empire State Building."	3	2		3																					
15117	6	"In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles.

An example is ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The stress of the dirigible moor would make the buildings frame bend and become weak. That is just one obstacle that the builders faced, but there is many more."	1	1		1																					
15119	6	"While building the Empire State Building the architects were faced with many obsticles when the decision was made to use the Empire State Building to talk, load, and refule dirigibles.  How to dock a dirigible to the side of a building was one of the biggest concerns, but the amount of stress this would cause was an even bigger worry.  But the greatest obsticle to this project was the wind, nature itself.  The fear was that the wind would blow the dirigible into a neighboring building, and tethering the dirigible was not an option for safety reasons.  Due to the architect's inability to overcome these obsticles the Empire State Building was never used for it's original purpose."	2	2		2

15127	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", builders of the Empire State Building face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible's to dock there. The main obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles need a large area to land. Al Smith said to add a mooring mast to the top of the building and that would allowed a dirigible to land for several hours. During the time of land the dirigible may get ""refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" Passengers could get off and on the dirigible safely by walking down a gangplank to the open platform. Architects had trouble putting a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because they were afraid that the load of the dirigible and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted. Dirigibles had trouble with saftly, most of dirigibles use hydroge instead of helium, but hydrogen was highly flammable. The greatest obstacle of mooring mast was nature itself, wind were high due to violent air currents, and it would not be safe for dirigibles. The practical reason why dirigibles weren't allow to moor at @ORGANIZATION2 was law agaist airship flying too low. The idea of dirigible was given away to airplanes. The obstacles the builders of @ORGANIZATION3 faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was solved."	3	4		4																					
15131	6	"The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building by attempting dirigibles to dock there were to many to predicte. The obstacles faced by dirigibles to dock there were because of many variables such as climite, Buildings and most of all the dirigibles them selfs.The climite as said in paragraph @NUM1 consisted with dangerouse and uncontraiable winds and the reason was because of the Empire State building itself. The urban areas around consited of sharp hull breaching spires and due to the winds it made a hull breach @NUM2 times more likely.Finaly there constrousion.

15135	6	"In the the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Also in @CAPS1 @NUM2 it says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was natur itself.

15136	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, their were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was the safety. Paragraph @NUM1 from the excerpts explains that, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" It shows us that if an accident was to happen on the mast above a densely populated area like downtown New York, then the accident could get ugly. Another reason why was nature itself. Paragraph @NUM2 explains that the, ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This was another safety issue because the dirigibles would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. A third obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. As you can see those were some obstacles builders faced."	3	3		3																					
15137	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. An obstacle dealt with if the dirigibles were fit to dock in the Empire State Building. Another obstacle dealt with the mast. These obstacles made this construction a failure such as the author who says, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"" in @CAPS1 thirteen.First of, @CAPS1 five states the dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make some lighter in the air."" @CAPS1 six states that, ""Some were as long as one thousand feet."" @CAPS2 how may a blimp of that size ever managed to land on the Empire State Building.

15138	6	"The architect of the new building had three large problems with allowing dirigibles to moor at the top.

Second The back of the dirigible would not be tied down.

Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This effect would also make a challenging and dangerous to take off. The last reason would be that it is illegal to fly aircraft sso low over the city already eliminating the possibility of allowing dirigibles to moor on top.

15159	6	"Based on the excerpt, builders faced many problems in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First, safety would be a large problem. Back then, most dirigibles used hydrogen (which is highly flammable) instead of helium to power them. This means that if there was a malfunction such as a fire, not only with the dirigible burst into flames, but the Empire State Building could too. Another obstacle builders had to confront was mother nature. According to paragraph @NUM1 of the reading, the location of the Empire State building has ""violent air currents"" with shifting winds. This problem would cause the dirigible to not stay stable. Although solutions like lead weights being hung from the back of the dirigible were offered, this only lead to more problems. If the lead weight fell, where would it land? The answer would be in the streets of @ORGANIZATION2 where pedestrians could be harmed. The final obstacle builders would have had to get through if they continued their plans for the dirigibles would be a law. The law stated (according to the reading) that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. So in theory, all of the plans the builders of this concoction had to be put to rest due to the governments law. In conclusion, many problems arose as building, and plans to make the ""Dirigible dock"" were made."	3	3		3																					
15164	6	"Throughout the process of building the Empire State Building with dirigibles dock there were many complications. At @CAPS1 the building was unable to simply put a mooring mast on top of the building. The roof was flat, therefore the dirigible would add stress to the building. They would need over @MONEY1 to modify the building framework. Then they realized that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is highly flammable which would be unsafe. They ran into a problem with nature itself. At the top of the Empire State Building the winds constantly shifted because of the violent air currents. Even if they were to tether the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around and around the mooring mast. Therefore with people all over the streets in @CAPS2 this was neither possibly or safe. There was also an exisisting law against flying airships too low over urban areas. All this gave way to airplanes, so even though dirigibles didn't work it helped."	3	3		3																					
15165	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that countries other than the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable, if it caught fire above a city, the results would be diasastrous. Another obstacle was that at such a hieght,  the winds would blow the back of the dirigible around. Perhaps the most obvious obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was the law that airships could not fly below a certain hieght over cities. All of these obstacles combined to make the project impractical and impossible"	3	3		3																					
15169	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow  dirigibles to dock there. The unforeseen safety issues lead to the downfall of the creative use for the building. ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1). They saw some of the dangerous affect of hydrogen when the German dirigible the Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire. ""Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@CAPS1). Other problems that the builders of the building faced were those of mother nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1). This made it hard for the dirigible to dock to the mast safely. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@CAPS1). Not only was nature playing against the builders, but the law was also. This is almost negligence on the builders part to not realize that they would be breaking a law by constructing this mooring mast. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1).

15170	6	"By attempting to construct a mast on the Empire State Building, builders encountered all sorts of problems. The purpose of this mast was to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock. Many of these problems however, were the effect of the dirigible itself. In paragraph thirteen, line @NUM1, the author talks about some of the dangers of the dirigible, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Another obstacle is location. It was thought to be very unsafe because if a blimp caught fire it would land in the middle of New York City, not some remote cornfield And finally, the winds changed frequently that high up. It was an unwise decision to dock at this area if the dirigible would be blown around the building."	2	3		3																					
15175	6	"Dirigibles, or blimps, were seen as the transportation of the future. In order to add height and yet serve a purpose, architects of the Empire state Building decided to build a mooring mast upon the building to accommodate ""aviation pioneers."" @CAPS1 the mast was built and gave the building its desired height, the usage of it as a docking station for dirigibles would never be fulfilled. The obstacles that builders had in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock included the height of the building, wind speeds, and the safety of civilians. The height of the building was 1,250 feet, thus having violent shifts in air currents. ""The wind s on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dirigibles also used hydrogen for fuel and lead weights to be weighed down; however, by using the mast, hydrogen and the use of lead weights provided a safety hazard to civilians below. Builders had created the mooring mast to dock dirigibles, but the idea caused problems and was never fulfilled."	2	2		2																					
15182	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION2 it revealed many problems with docking dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. Al Smith, the Architect working on the Empire State Building thought the mooring mast would go up with no problems. Architects soon realized that the mooring mast would add stress to the buildings frame work and cost @MONEY1 in modifications. After seeing what happened to the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" in Lakehurst, Architects soon realized that having dirigibles filled with highly-flamable hydrogen over the densely populated New York City wasn't a good idea. Nature itself would not allow the mooring mass to be built.There was such violent air currents at the one thousand and fifty foot tall @ORGANIZATION1 altitude that made Architects aware that this idea couldn't be upheld. The dirigible would swivel around because it couldn't be weighed down like in open landing fields. They couldnt use these weights because having weights suspended over pedestrians heads was neither practical nor safe. There is also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to try and dock a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building.

If there wasn't area to land, there was no reason or way to build it. Also, the builders would have to remodel the whole building. After the building was framed to the 85th floor, they couldn't build the mast until the roof was done, so it took even longer.The greatest obstacle the mast dealt with was nature itself, because the winds on the tops of the buildings were constantly shifting, so there was no way for a dirigible to land or stay in place without crashing. The final obstacle builders faced was a law against airships flying too low to the urban areas, which made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or even approach the building.As you can see, there were many obstacles, and the mast wasn't useful.

For example the building had to be reframed because its original frame could not support the weight of a dirigible on top it. Also the materials inside dirigibles are highly flammable so an accident above an urban area thats highly popuated would have been costly/fatal. Another obstacle was the wind, since the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents the dirigible would be swiveling around and unstable, thus making the idea for docking dirigibles on top of the empire state building unpractical and unsafe."	3	3		3																					
15219	6	"Based on the excerpt to the dirigibles were not ever able to dock atop the Empire State building because @CAPS1 it was a question of safty.

This caused the Hindenburg a German made vessel to burst into flames in New Jersey, and when this happened the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had happend in the densly populated New York City. Also this was a question of safty because the winds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible all around. Lastly there is a law prohibiting the flight of airships in low urban aeras so the ships could not fly in New York City"	3	3		3																					
15220	6	"In the article, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the author talks about the many obstacles builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building. The first obstacle they faced involved dropping the mast onto the buildings flat roof. This task would be easy because using a single cable to lower the mast would add a great deal of stress to the buildings frame. Another problem they faced was nature. The violent winds would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast. The greatest obstacle involved safety. Lots of blimps outside of the @LOCATION2 use highly flammable helium, rather than hydrogen. Helium makes the dirigibles more likely to cause an explosion, and risk many lives of the people of New York. Lastly, existing laws in New York @CAPS1 the balloons to dock. Airships were flying dangerously close over urban areas. Many obstacles were faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building that were mentioned in the article, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted."	2	3		3																					
15223	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it describes many ways the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. It was hard enough for the builders to build the Empire State Building but on top of that they must make a mooring mast at the top. Four term governor of New York Al Smith said it best, ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring out some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" Another obstacle builders faced was having a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, only held by a single cable tether, was simply not safe. With this being said, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened, costing over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications. No matter how the builders built the Empire State Building they still face nature as an obstacle. These are examples builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
15234	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when they were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the safety of the people. The author states, ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" This would have been a major problem. Another obstacle was the violent air currents that made it hard to land. In this essay it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This quote shows why landing would be dangerous. Finally, it was illegal to fly airships too low over urban areas. The text explains, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area."" this shows how even if everything worked, they wouldn't be able to do it These are just three of the obstacles that prevented the builders of the Empire State Building from docking dirigibles."	4	3		4

15240	6	"Some of the troubles builders came into play with while constructing the empire state buildings mooring mast, were structure, how it would be built, and how it could physically hold a blimp without being ripped out.

15242	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building attempted to create a mast where dirigibles could dock. At first I thought it was a great idea, then realized there were obstacles. First obstacle discovered was ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" (Lüsted). This was an issue because hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch on fire in New York, thousands of people would be hurt/killed. The greatest obstacle was the wind. The amount of wind changed constantly and even if the dirigible was attached properly, the back would continue to move around, which would lead to danger on the streets. The dirigible would be dangling over the pedastrians (Lüsted). One other reason was a legal reason. It was illegal to fly a dirigible too low over urban areas, therefore the dirigible was not allowed to get low enough to land on the building Two tried and neither of them were successful. The constructors of the mooring mast were oblivious to these issues at the beginning, than realized them after. The Empire State Building could not be used to land dirigible due to the fact that non-U.S dirigibles used Hydrogen, the current of the wind changes frequently, and it was illegal to fly the dirigible low enough to attach."	4	3		4

15255	6	"From the story the Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders faced huge problems when they tried to make it accessable for dirigibles to land. One major factor was the winds at such high altitude, ""The winds on top of building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The builders not only had to think of a way for the ships to be secure and not low around, but also needed a way to support the weight of the dirigible because of the already heavy building.

Another obsticle they had overcome was the fact that the city did not allow the dirigibles to be that close to rural areas. Although these reasons are plenty enough, the article mentions that perhaps the greatest obsticle was nature itself.

15276	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the obstacles faced was when trying to dock on top of the building.

When the Los Angeles tried to dock there, it couldn't, because ""[it] could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" Also, ""the @CAPS1. could not even take his hands off the control levers."" because the dirigible might bump into other buildings if he did.

""... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" The third huge obstacle they faced was that there was an actual law against anything flying that low in cities. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This meant that the dirigibles couldn't even get close enough to tie up since they were allowed to fly down to it. Since there were so many apparent obstacles and flaws in the plan, the builders should've caught it before and never built the mooring mast above the Empire State Building"	3	3		3

Also there was no safe way to weigh the dirigible down, like when the dirigible lands in a field. Any weights used would be hanging over pedestrians.  Another obstacle was the law prohibiting airships flying low over urban areas This law made it illegal for dirigibles to dock or approach the area The main obstacle was nature itself.

Outside the United States the dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Other countries ships could set on fire in the United States and put people in danger. Also the fact that the loading dock was more than 1,250 feet and loading off could be unstable because of the winds.

Another obstacle faced in this creation was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting and the idea of a dirigible dangling high above pedestrians was not safe. The last reason that the dirigibles were not safe was the existing law in the U.S. At the time of the building of the Empire State Building, a law existed that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas.

15344	6	"In the 1930's, the idea to have a mooring mast mounted on the top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles to dock was a very popular theory. However, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced, such as existing laws concerning airships, flammable, hydrogen dirigibles, strong winds, and the stress a moored dirigible would add to the buildings frame. Existing ""air traffic laws would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the Empire State Building or even fly near it, since airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas (paragraph @NUM1). The destruction of the Hindenburg, a hydrogen dirigible, helped the owners of the Empire State building realize how dangerous dirigibles could be, especially if they combusted over downtown New York City (paragraph @NUM2). Strong winds also would be hazardous to dirigibles moored to the empire state building, seeing as the aircrafts couldn't be way down in the air (paragraph @NUM3). The steel frame of the building would also have to be modified to accommodate the stress added by a moored dirigible.

15346	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building in New York faced many obstacles while attempting to allowed dirigibles to dock. One obstacle of the builders was creating the Empire State Building with the strength to hold the dirigible, swaying in the wind, without the building falling over. The weight of the dirigible would have to be transferred to the bottom of the building which was almost eleven hundred feet below. The largest obstacle, however, was holding the dirigible in place while it was docked atop the building. The winds were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" and would make the dirigible fly wildly around the top of the building (@CAPS1 paragraph @NUM1).

The recent explosion of the Hindenburg showed potential problems in docking these aircraft. If a blimp was to explode in downtown New York, it could be a disaster. Another obstacle that would be faced is nature. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing. The unpredictable wind atop the building made the idea of mooring a zeppelin very illogical. At this time, laws against flying low in urban areas were coming around. These would make for docking the airships to be illegal. The idea for making the Empire State Building a mooring post was an engineering feat but the actual usage of it was not practical."	3	3		3

These dirigibles or blimps were large balloons that were capable of carrying passengers but needed a great landing area. In order for dirigibles to be used as transportation, architects needed to design a suitable mooring mast. However, the weight and pressure of a blimp on a mast would cause a large amount of stress to the building's frame. The builders of the Empire State building were faced with producing ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to the building's framework. Not only was attempting blimps to dock there a lot of work and very costly, builders were challenge with safety issues. As experienced to the German blimp ""Hindenburg,"" dirigibles that use hydrogen are ""highly flammable."" If any incident occurred over the Empire State building in New York, involving a dirigible, it would affect the enormous population in the area by killing so many lives. Flying too low over the city was another challenge to safety that a law would make illegal and unsuccessful for blimps to be used. Lastly, nature was an obstacle the builders faced in docking dirigibles. At mast times, the ""forceful winds"" would cause the back of the ship swivel which could lead to it hitting the sharp spires and be punctured.

Al Smith realized this even before he finalized the process of building. Once he finally did complete the mooring mast, he faced obstacles. The dirigibles had problems with docking, due to the wind and the elements, the dirigibles had a hard time staying stationary once docked. Another obstacle was fuel, due to the recent Hindenburg crash, dirigibles needed to be fueled with helium rather than the more flammable hydrogen. Finally, the laws that were in place about airships not being allowed to fly low over urban areas caused the mooring mast to fail.

Another obstacle faced by the builders was the weather. The weather affected the use of the mooring mast because ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" A practical reason why the mooring mast could not dock dirigibles At the Empire State Building was because of the law against airships. The law said that airships could not fly too low over urban areas making it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building. These are a Few of the many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building which prevented the use of the mooring mast."	4	4		4																					
15447	6	"In theory, the idea of creating a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building was a great idea. However in reality, it didn't turn out so well. There are many reasons why a dirgible could not be docked to the Empire State Building. For example: ""Most dirgibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of Helium"" (paragraph @NUM1) This was dangerous because hydrogen is extremely flammable, and if for some reason an accident occurred, it could be catastrophic over a densely populated city like New York. Possibly the most dangerous obstacle was the climate around the Empire State Building. There is a constant powerful wind that shifts a lot due to all the different air currents the building creates. If a dirigible docked there, it would be blowing all over the place, if it could even dock at all. Most dirigibles that were moored in open fields were weighted down with lead weights in the back, but this would be too dangerous to try over a city teeming with people. Lastly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... this would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""

15448	6	"The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. In the short excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, many obstacles were clearly stated to why the mast was not a good idea. The building of the mast was rushed. Al Smith had realized that he was close to losing the title of the worlds tallest building and quickly put the mast to mind. Problems quickly arose The first problem that had arose was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith stated that passengers could safely swing in the breeze. This problem was ignored and soon other problems arose as the building of the mast continued. The greatest problem that should have been thought about before building the mast was nature itself The winds were horrible at the height of the building and architects soon realized that landing would be a major issue. The mast was still questioned and architects and engineers were doing all they could to make it work until something was brought upon them, a law. It is illegal for airships to fly too low over an urban area. The law that was realized marked the end of Al Smith's idea and by the late 1930's, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers have quietly disappeared."	3	2		3																					
15453	6	"The obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock had some consequences. One of the obstacles to there expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Also, the Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire state buildings flat roof because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The last obstacle why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"	3	4		4																					
15465	6	"The main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there stemmed from the bad location. The dirigibles would be docking 1,250 feet above one of the busiest cities in the world. This would create three problems for the docking of the dirigibles. The first problem is hydrogen is what was used in dirigibles and it is extremely flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above downtown New York many people would be killed. This means not many people are going to want the dirigibles docking there. If the Empire State Building had not been above such a densely populated area they may have not had this problem. The next difficulty would be the fact that at that altitude in New York City there are violent wind currents that are always changing. This makes it hard for the conductors to dock the dirigible and it also could possibly cause the dirigible to hit something and pop. So again the dirigible is falling into downtown New York and killing many people. This is another reason it was a bad location. It needed to be in a place where there were more stable wind currents. The final obstacle was there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that even if the other to factor disappear there was a law the builders should have known about that forbade their plans. Like the author said the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."	3	3		3																					
15466	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. If they were to succeed, they would have become a major aviation accommidation for transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. In order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, the mooring mast needed to be constructed and put on to the top of the building. Simply adding the masts to the building was no easily reached task. The Empire State Building's frame needed to be modified so it could withstand the stress from the dirigible mounted onto the mooring mast. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to adjust the building's framework. Once the framework was adjusted, architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that was illuminated from the inside. This tower served as a mast for the building to come. Before the mooring mast could be constructed, the roof of the building had to be completed. Once the roof was constructed, the mooring mast was added with its own skeleton of steel. Once the entire project was finished, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that docking dirigibles would be much too dangerous. After all the rigorous work put into the mooring mast was completed, it became clear that it would never be used for its original purpose."	2	2		2																					
15474	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they had to overcome was that if a dirigibles, which could reach up to a thousand feet in length, was moored to the tops of the building it would add stress to the building's frame. This meant the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened and modified to deal with the added stress. The cost of the modifications was over sixty thousand dollars. The next challenge was discovered after the building was finished. This was the fact that having dirigibles moor at the Empire State Building was unsafe. This first reason why it is unsafe is that most dirigibles, not from the United States, used hydrogen into helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. This meant an accident like that of the Hindenburg could happen above the highly populated downtown area of New York. Another problem that arose after the construction was that the shifting winds on top of the building were too violent for the dirigible, which would swivel around the mooring mast. All these challenges along with an existing law they did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas were the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building and is why only one dirigible was ever moored there."	4	4		4																					
15481	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. The greatest obsticle was nature itself. With violent changing winds and climate, it made it extremely hard to tie dirigibles down to the mooring mast. The other main reason why dirigibles could not moor on the Empire State Building was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The dirigibles will never be tied down to the moor because it would break the law. Safety was also a big reason why the dirigibles could not be tied down to the moor. Dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium to fill their dirigibles. The hydrogen is very flammable so people feared if it were to catch fire over a busy city like New York, all hell would let loose. These were a few examples of the struggles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building."	3	3		3

Another obstacle faced with the mooring mast was one of safety. Dirigibles not from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which is Highly flammable. Another obstacle to the construction was nature itself, with high, shifting winds due to violent air currents, a dirigible tethered to the mast would swivel around and around the Empire State Building, the only way to prevent this would be to tie the lead weights to the rear end, but massive dangling weights, hanging over one thousand feet above the public, was not the safest idea.

15495	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced four main problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems was solved, the other three were not. The first obstacle was that since each dirigible would be connected to the top of the building by a single cable, enormous stress would be put on the frame of the building. This was solved by simply reinforcing the frame of the Empire State Building, but it cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the modifications. The second obstacle was not so easily solved. Dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen to stay afloat. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the example of the Hindenburg blimp that burst into flame alerted the owners and builders of the Empire State Building to how dangerous an accident like that, especially in densely populated New York City, could be. The third obstacle also proved impossible to solve - because of the high speed of the winds at the top of the building, there would be no way for a dirigible to @CAPS1 safely. During the only test, the Los Angeles navy dirigible could not get close enough to @CAPS1 because of the high winds. It would have been all too easy for the dirigible to spin out of control and hit a spire on a nearby building.

Stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Another obstacle for the builder's was that the building's steel frame would have to be strengthened to accommodate with this new design. The greatest obstacle in launching this new design was nature. Architects would needed to consider the constant shifting of winds due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be unsturdy. The fact that this design would be dangling above the pedestrians on the street, would worry the architects concern of the population. Architects also had to deal with the law against airships traveling too low above urban areas.

New York lacked a suitable landing area for a dirigible. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. Also, safety was a problem. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how the accident could've been worse, especially in New York. Even nature was an obstacle. Winds were constantly shifting on top of the building. So lead weights were used for the dirigible which wasn't safe, because they were dangling over pedestrians. There was a law that airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas."	3	2		3																					
15653	6	"While designing a dirigible docked at the top of the Empire State building, the architects and engineers encountered many obstacles. Being such an immense project, these obstacles came naturally. The first obstacle was purely architectural. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects would have to redesign the building frame in order for the building to last. The two other obstacles should have been clear from the start; the first, being nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Now, the dock not only would be hard to reach, but extremely unsafe. The last obstacle couldn't have been overcome by the architects or engineers if they tried, not legally anyway. ""... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" would also restrict the project, and actually stop it alltogether. Clearly, some large deciding factors had been overlooked while designing the moor. @ORGANIZATION2's competitive attitude made this so, but ""The Mooring Mast... was never destined to fulfill its purpose."""	3	3		3																					
15657	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many promblems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most of there problem they encountered when designing the mast. They found that they could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the building at a thousand feet. The building was not strong enough, so they had to strengthen the building with a new steel frame. Then the builders also faced safety issues. At a thousand feet the air currents were extremely violant. By the end of the construction it was quickly noticed that dirigibles could not land on the Empire State Building."	3	2		3																					
15658	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that prevented dirigibles from landing there. It was too dangerous to tether dirigibles to the mast of the building for four main reasons. The first was that a dirigible moored to the mast of the building ""would add stress to the building's frame"". This problem was soon solved, however, as the steel frame was changed and it became strong enough to endure the added stress. Another reason that dirigibles could not be attached to the Empire State building is that dirigibles are highly flammable when they use hydrogen gas. It became apparent that if a dirigible were to catch fire in downtown New York it would be too terrible to risk. Dirigibles also couldn't be attached to the mast because the winds on top of the building would cause the back of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" and this would not be safe. Finally, dirigibles could not be moored to the Empire State building because ""the sharp spires of other buildings in the area [could] puncture the dirigible's shell"". The dirigibles could not fly so low without posing a risk to the people. Dirigibles could not land at the Empire State Building because there were too many dangers."	3	4		4																					
15659	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced constructing a correct mooring mast for the zepplins, and concerning the safety of the people in the city. They also had to account for the weather and how it may have affected the blimps.      The builders had to add on more floors to the building and strengthen it's base so that the mast could work properly and stay stable. then they ruled out using weights to anchor the blimps in place because the people on the street below. Also the chemicals in the blimp were highly flamable and put people around at risk. Sometimes the winds were too strong for the blimps to get close enough without being punctured. The builders were faced with impossible obstacles to overcome"	3	3		3																					
15660	6	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a huge challenge for them to face. For example, mother nature itself was one of they're huge challenges they would mostly face. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were constantly shifting and shifting due to violent air currents. As soon as an dirigible would hook up to the building, workers would have to find a way to keep they're airship from crashing into the building from the rusty winds at the top of the building. Therefore, if a dirigible- crashed anywhere on the ground it would burst into an inferno because the inside of a dirigible is filled with hydrogen and helium, so if it did crashed it will involve heat and fire that would be coming from the sparks it prevents as it crashes on the ground."	2	2		2																					
15661	6	"The obstacles the builders of the empire State Building faced, was the lack of a suitable landing area. They will ""allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuel, or service, and to let passengers off and on"".

15674	6	" There were many obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building.One of these obstacles was the wind currents atop the building. They were uncontrolable, forceful and unexpected.

Another problem was a law against airships that flew to low to the ground in urban areas. Not only was the idea dangerous, but it was also illegal. On May 6, 1937, a German dirigible called Hindenburg exploded in Lakehurst, New Jersey. This was due to the flammable hydrogen that was used to lift the dirigible. Since all dirigibles at this time obtained hydrogen another threat was introduced. This was the chance of it exploding while trying to dock on the Empire State Building. If it exploded while above numerous citizens, many lives would be in @CAPS3. The mooring mast idea, was now non-sense."	4	3		4																					
15686	6	"Although the builders dream of using the Empire State Building as a dock for dirigibles was a brilliant one, the builders came across many problems. One problem was the law against flying too low over urban areas like New York City. Also, nature played a huge part in why their plan didnt work. The violent wind currents throughout the city affected the plan. Most dirigibles landed in open fields where their back end could be weighted down. This would be impossible docked to the building causing the dirigible to sway around possibly hitting other buildings. The builders didn't take into consideration how densely populated New York City is. If anything ever happened to a docked dirigible like the Hindenburg many people would be affected. This is why the idea always stayed a dream."	2	3		3																					
15692	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" author Marcia Amidon Lüsted speaks of the obsticles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the frame of the Building had not been built to withstand a thousand foot long blimp docking to it. Therefore, changes would have to be made to make the building stronger. As the excerpt says, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"". Also, having dirigibles dock to the building would be unsafe for many reasons. For example, dirigibles were often filled with hydrogen rather than helium, and as the excerpt points out ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" thus, the owners of the building realized that it could cause tragedy if a blimp were to crash while flying above New York's busy streets. Also, strong winds at the top of the building made it difficult and dangerous for blimps to dock at the mooring mast, because they would cause the back of the ship to constantly move. Finally, there were laws preventing aircrafts to fly so low over the city. There were many obsticles in allowing dirigibles to dock to the building."	4	4		4

There was also a safety issue with docking dirigibles, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (¶ @NUM2). One last obstacle the builders faced was the wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (¶ @NUM3).

Once the mooring mast was built the builders still encountered more problems. Dirigibles coming in from outside the @LOCATION2 ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM3).

If one were to catch fire, it would be a danger to all of New York City. Secondly, the high winds made it unsafe for the dirigibles. Paragraph @NUM1 states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."". Lastly, the builders faced the obstacle of pre- existing laws when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. An existing law stated that aircraft couldn't fly too low over urban areas.

What if one of their dirigibles caught fire over New York. The whole idea of dirigibles was thought of as dangerous. Finally, there were laws saying that no aircraft could be that close to the city.

15819	6	"The obstacles builders faced were weather, hight of the structure, stability of the structure, and worriying about the highly flamable gases from the dirigible. The weather affected having the dirigible dock there because the winds could whip it around, knocking it into nearby buildings. The structure needs to be stable at it's hight so the dirigible doesn't knock over the empire state building. The author Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 states, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" this was nessisary so the dirigible wouldn't knock over the Empire State Building, wiping out a lot of New York. The highly flammable gases would need to be under intense supervision, because if they caught of fire the Empire State Building and pedestrians, and downtown New York would catch of fire. These reasons are the obstacles they faced and why a mooring mast was never completed and used."	3	3		3																					
15824	6	"The idea of using a mooring mast in order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was never a practical one. This is due to the many struggles that were faced when Al Smith's team was attempting to create a mooring mast that would serve the purpose of docking dirigibles. such obstacles included; the pressure a docked dirigible would have on the building itself, the hazards of high winds causing the dirigible to be shaken violently, the chance of the dirigible catching on fire due to the flamibility of the hydrogen if in it, and the close proximity the dirigible would have to other buildings in the area The first problem faced during the development of the mooring mast was the stress of the heavyweight of the dirigible would put on the building. ""The steel frame of the [building] would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate [the added pressure from the dirigible]."" The dirigible's weight was not the only thing that put stress on the building, the wind pressure would also. The wind made it difficult for creating a mooring mast's structure because it would not only add pressure to the building because the dirrigible itself to not be able to stay in one place ""Even if the dirrigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" An accident that could occur would be a fire due to possible flamibility. And since the dirrigible is so close to people, such as tourist on the building's observation deck, the dirrigible catching on fire (if it's filled with hydrogen instead of helium) could be more disastrous than if it landed in an open field. Lastly,  the dirigibleis so close to urban areas that it is illegal for such airships to dock or even fly at such proximity.  For example, when the Los Angeles tested  the docking process to the mooring mast of the Empire State Building it ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" All of these were major obstacles to the building process of the Empire State Building and it's mooring mast for docking dirigibles. These are also the reasons why the architects of the Empire State Building came to the conclusion that such a structure would not be practical to construct."	4	3		4																					
15827	6	"Although there were great hopes for the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, many obstacles were faced while trying to reach this dream. One obstacle noticed while designing the mast to dock on, was that the height and weight of a dirigible would greatly add stress to the building's frame. This would then be transmitted to the building's foundation as well. This clearly possessed a problem bigger than the Empire State Building could withstand. Another reason that builders faced an obstruction in the hopes of allowing dirigibles to dock was safety reasons. One of the most apparent problems, was that most dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 were fueled by hydrogen gas, opposed to helium gas. This posed a threat, for hydrogen is highly flammable. Putting a densely populated area such as downtown New York at risk consequently came as an obstacle for builders. The nature itself came as one of the last problems for such a dream. Winds that were constantly shifting due to extreme air currents, at the top of the building could easily cause the back of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast.

But, then yet the electric winch cable would cause stress to the building frame. The stress of these Dirigibles load and the wind pressure would transmitte all the way to the building's Foundation. The steel Frame of the building should be strengthened or modified to accommodate this new situation."	3	2		3																					
15830	6	In building the mast and docking to the empire state building the constructers faced major problems. The Idea of a dock for dirigibles was a good idea at the time but faced both structrial and social problems. Architects and stated that over time the dock for the dirigible and climatic change would cause strain on the framework of the building. This led to more reconstruction and economic spendings. Another problem the builders faced was the location of the building itself. Newly built dirigibles had hydrogen rather than helium which led to flamibility. The Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire which led the builders to consider what would happened if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Docking of dirigibles led to many obstacles which ultimately led to the project shutting down. What was thought as the future is now the past.	3	2		3																					
15837	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders had obstacles they had to overcome in building the dock for the dirigibles. The builders had to think about how the mast would work. It said in paragraph nine ""the architects could not simply drop a morning mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"". The buiders had to modify the building. ""As it said in paragraph ten ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast with out any ornamentation, the architects designed a shinny glass and chrome-nickle stainless steel tower that would be illinated frome inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the over all shape of the building itself."" The obstacles the builders overcame let them use the mast efectly."	1	1		1																					
15840	6	"There were many obstacles workers face when building the Empire State Building: making the structure of the tallest in the world, making it serve a greater purpose than being just a building and most of all it had to be stable.Designing and building the tallest structure in the world was quite the @CAPS2 for architect Al Smith, his building had to be taller than the 1,046 foot tall Chrysler Building. The Chrysler building was originally only @NUM1 feet and the Empire State building was planned to be @NUM2 feet. But when the architect of the Chrysler Building revealed a spire that was to be placed on top, the Chrysler Building's height shot up to 1,046 feet, just 46 feet taller than the Empire State. The competition had begun.When Al Smith was constructing a piece to fit on top of the sky-scraping building, he wanted to be ""more than a spire or dome or pyramid put there to add a desired a few feet"" (paragraph @NUM3), he wanted something that would truly awe people. With the popularity of blimps, or dirigibles, on the rise, Smith decided he would create a docking station for them on top of his building. Although, a great deal of effort and frustration proved the task impossible. The main reason being that there was too much margin for error and that chance did not want to be taken with a crowded city of @ORGANIZATION3 below. The tip still being added though, put the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet, @NUM4 feet taller then the Chrysler Building.The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 that the building seems to face was the elements. The monstrous structure had to withstand very high winds. Most of the building was weather proof, the only problem being the top. It was designed to look almost like a rocketship, with four wings at it's base. Lined with steel, th structure still holds today. Most of the challenges faced by the crew building this magnificent structure seemed impossible, but they created the building they set out to build. And it is still the tallest in the world to this day."	1	2		2																					
15843	6	"In Downtown New York, Al Smith and his builders faced many obstacles in building and docking his dirigible on top of the mooring mast which had come to a failure by the end. The reason he planned to dock in New York because that's where most passengers would be at the location, where Smith would see it would be a success. The dirigibles are made ""with enormous steel-framed balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium"" (paragraph @NUM1), at the time that Smith wasn't thinking, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM2) as well as the cotton fabric would catch on fire also; it is a dangerous hazard if any incident would have been in a ""densely populated area."" Another obstacle they dealed with was the ""dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3) since it was illegal to dock the dirigibles in low areas, it couldn't happen for Smith, and the size of the dirigible, it's too long to not able to crash into one of the other buildings. Not only that but ""the mooring mast could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires of the building in the area"" (paragraph @NUM3) and it would most likely to happen since there are many buildings closely to one another in New York. With all these problems that they had faced through; failed; the dirigibles wasn't the future transportation by Al Smith, all of his plan's failed by the end."	3	3		3																					
15846	6	"The mooring mast atop the empire state buildings problems should have been foreseeable before its construction. The workers building it were certainly against the odds during its construction. The top of the Empire State Building was in a constant weather crisis, ""Winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This meant that a dirigible that would attach to the mooring mast would be swaying in the wind. On land, dirigibles have lead dead weights that weighted the back so it didn't sway but that just wasn't practical hanging over crowded city streets. Also, the building could not support a dirigible without transferring its energy back down to the foundation. This meant that the entire building had to be reinforced to move the energy. It was also illegal for dirigibles to fly that low over urban areas, and since most @CAPS1 blimps were using hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, the safety of the project was questioned. After the Hindenburg, people seemed more reluctant to support such a project and even the owners of the Empire State Building realized how catastrophic an accident over a place like downtown New York could be. Overall, the theory of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building would remain a theory due to predictable obstacles."	4	4		4																					
15848	6	"The engineers involved in the creation of the Empire State Building were forced to confront reality when an array of obstacles presented themselves during the time in which the were trying to dock dirigibles. The primary problem was the usefulness of this dock creation. Though this idea was innovative, it was not practical, as dirigibles were never destined to be a popular source of transport. The malfunction in the creation of the idea was its focus. This is because the goal in this work was not to create a successful dock, but to add footage to the building. If the focus had been different, the outcome may have been more rewarding. Technical problems also arose. Based on laws, safety, and practicality it could not function. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen,"" creating an extreme fire hazard in a highly populated place that would transform into a deathtrap. The anchor for the blimp would only secure it at one point allowing the blimp the spin around, dangerously in the wind. Lead weights, the only solution to this, would disrupt pedestrians. There was also an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" making the project completely unpractical. Both attempts at reaching the building failed, displaying the reality of the flaws. Winds and other complications were preventative. All in all, the builders were destined to be unsuccessful with the plethora of flaws in this project."	3	3		3																					
15851	6	There was one major problem with the dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building. This major problem was that the mooring mast is so high up in the air and downtown New York where The Empire State Building is located is such a crowded area. If something goes wrong it will affect a huge area because New York is such an urban area. It is a good idea but Al Smith did not take all the precautions that he needed to. Because if something does go wrong a lot will go wrong because downtown New York is such a crowded area. Thats the main obstacle that the builders had to overcome with letting dirigibles dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building.	2	1		2																					
15869	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there are lack of a suitable landing area. In the excerpt they said ""The one obstacle was their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Another obstacle was the climate like wind pressure. For example they said ""The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"". The next obstacle is dirigibles from outside of the United States. The dirigibles German's use hydrogen which is flammable. They said ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Thats obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock."	3	3		3																					
15870	6	"Based on the article, ""the Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there are many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. @ORGANIZATION2 states in paragraph @NUM1, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons have been aparent before it was ever constructed."" One reason was safety. The dirigibles that were made outside of @LOCATION1 contained hydrogen instead of helium, thats wrong because hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was because of the winds. They constantly change, they are violent air currents, and they moved the dirigible. The other reason and most important reason is because dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because its illegal. There is a law against airships fly too low over urban areas and for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it was illegal. There were many obstacles the builders went through."	3	3		3																					
15872	6	"The builders faced a lot of obstacles when building the empire state Building. They had to build it higher than any other building, but make sure its stable at the same time. They also had to make the top of the building perfectly or else the dirigibles would not be able to land. Eventually it was safe enough for the dirigibles to land and the people could get off and take a tour of the top part of the building."	1	1		1																					
15875	6	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced attempting to allow derigibles to dock there are the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation which was eleven hundred feet below. But the greatest obstacle was the wind, which would constantly shift, due to violent air currents."	2	2		2																					
15882	6	"The Empire State Building was meant to be great The tallest building in the world. Although they did achieve there goal of height, the true purpose of the building was never used.The building was supposed to serve as a holding dock for these new air Ships called dirigibles. However this was not the case. There were reasons that were apparent before it was ever builtOne of the greatest obstacles was nature itself The winds at the top of the building were too strong for the dirigible to be safetly secure. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, and trying to weigh it down with bricks was impractical. Another problem that was faced was the law that would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. But two ships did try to land. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles failed in landing because it was too dangerous. In the end, the Empire State Building never served as a station for dirigibles."	3	2		2																					
15885	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was in paragraph 6, the excerpt says, ""one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This means that the architects needed to build enough area to land the dirigibles, precisely and carefully. Another obstacle was in paragraph @NUM1, which said, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This is explaining that the outcome of nature can be predicted, but it cannot be controlled. The amount of ""violent air currents"" can disturb the landing of dirigibles and it is ""neither practical nor safe"" for the dirigibles to dangle high above the pedestrians that are on the street. Unfortunately, Al Smith's plan to able the dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building was unsuccessful. There was a law stated in paragraph @NUM2, that made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approached the area"". Instead of using the mooring mast, the dirigibles gave way to airplanes."	3	3		3																					
15893	6	"In the excerpt, the builders and architects building the Empire State Building had numerous problems trying to build the mast on the top of the building. One reason was that they built it before even considering the problems it may cause. The biggest problem was safety: ""the hydrogen used in the dirigibles was highly flammable."" Another problem was wind: ""they would never be able to use the mooring mast because of the violent winds shifting at that height."" If the dirigible was ever tied to the building, ""it's back end would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The derigibles moored in fields could be held down with lead weights but using those @NUM1 feet above downtown New York would not be safe at all. The final problem was a law against airships flying that low over cities and pedestrians. So, neadless to say, it wouldn't work out."	3	3		3																					
15894	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were many. The architects could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building that was only held by a single cable tether. This would add stress to the buildings frame. To be able to handle the dirigible's load the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and Strengthened, which was over sixty thosand dollars 'worth. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were always shifting which could lead to the back of the ship swiveling around and around the mooring mast."	2	2		2																					
15904	6	"The obstacles that the builders of The Empire State builduing faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were they had to allow the dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on or off. The dirigibles were docked by means of electric Winch, Which hauled in a line from the front of the Ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigibles Could Swing in the breeze, and yet passengers Could Safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. They had to go through all these obstacles in order to build The Empire State builduing."	1	0		1																					
15907	6	"The architects didn't realize how many potential problems the mooring mast would bring until it had failed. The greatest reason why the dirigibles couldn't land was purely safety complications. Many dirigibles at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. Another main reason was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were very violent and could easily push a dirigible in the wrong direction. Before these problems, there was an already existing law against the flying of airships too low over urban areas. Dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State building because it was unsafe and illegal."	3	3		3																					
15908	6	"In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building had many obsticales to deal with. They had to make sure the dirigiles good go high enough and be safe for passengers to board and get off safely. The builders had to deal with alot.""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of @ORGANIZATION1 roof."" Because of the buildings hight they were uable to make things work. The dirigible was too much and it added stress to the buildings frame, to unload things it was to difficult the floor it needed to be on was too low.""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the Final the final instalation of the landing gear."" The project was so difficult that they had to quit the task and expand at another time. The workers were devistated."	1	2		2																					
15914	6	"When the empire state building was constructed it ran into many problems attempting to dock dirigibles there. One problem they ran into is that most overseas blimps were still filled with hydrogen, which is a very flammable gas. The constructors did not want to re-create the Hindenburg accident over a densely populated area such as New York City. The greatest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself. The wind currents atop the building were violent and always shifting. Docking a Dirigible there in those conditions would cause it to swivel around the building and become unsafe for passengers. That is why the mooring mast never fulfilled it's purpose."	3	2		3																					
15916	6	"By reading the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted it is easy to see the many complications with landing a dirigible on top of a 1,250 ft. building. For one there is the natural effect of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1 winds would make it difficult to land any floating aircraft anywhere if the back wasn't able to be weighted down. Another obstacle the builders faced was that the frame had to be strong enough to hold a @NUM1 ft. long dirigible. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The worker's then had to spend over @MONEY1 to remodel the framework of the Empire State Building. Another issue is that anchoring the blimps would be illegal. According to ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" All these safety troubles and violations would all together make the ""mooring"" an impossible feat."	3	4		4																					
15917	6	"The architects and builders faced large problems in the construction of the docking platform, even though they had not notice them at first. The builders did not notice any large problem untill after the dirigible Hindenburg crashed in Lakehurst. The building's owners became greatly concerned for the safety of the people inside and below the building if a blimp fell into the same situation as the Hindenburg."	1	1		1																					
15919	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced not so many but difficult obstacles. one of the obstacles were the crowded @CAPS1 they had for the dirigible. crowded @CAPS1 can cause the dirigible to hit or bump into another building if not pop the thing. The wind could also make the dirigible sway and hit another building. Another obstacle was the stress the building was having because the dirigible was tied to it. If the wind blew hard, the dirigible would put alot of tension on the building and something could go wrong."	2	4		2																					
15926	6	Some obstacles the builders faced were too much stress to the buildings frame. It would have to transmit all the weight and pressure all the way to the building's foundation. Also there would only be one cable holding it in place. The cable was called a tether. Another obstacle would be an existing law saying that you cant moor your ship there because you are flying to low. In December 1930 the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible tried parking there but they were affraid of the wind knocking it into another building. Therefor they went threw a few hard obstacles but in the end they fixed it and made it happen.	2	2		2																					
15927	6	"Derigibles, modernly called blimps were widely regarded in the @DATE1's as the latest and greatest form of transportation there was. These derigibles needed quick means of refueling and unloading passenger both eficiently and with safety. At the very time these derigibles became popular modern day skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building were dominating the skyline in New York City. Al Smith, a former governor of New York who was heading efforts to construct the Empire State Building came up with the idea of building a mooring mast on the top of his building which would help dirigibles dock, refuel and unload cargo quickly and efficiently. Although, at the time this idea was thought of as both ""practical"" and ""workable"" it was never put to use because of safety concerns found later by Architects. These safety concerns included fear of the ""constantly shifting"" winds ""due to violent air currents"" as well as air space restricting laws that prohibited ""airships from flying too low over urban areas."" Although this idea seemed revolutionary at the time, many obstacles stood in its path to glory."	2	3		3																					
15934	6	The obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced was harsh. They had to figure out how they were going to get the dirigibles to land on the mooring mast. A another problem was that the government was getting unpaticent. What made thing worse was Al smith was being sneaky and unturful. He lied about how high the actulty hieght is. He lied about how he will fix the problems the was with the mooring mast. They were also afraid that a dirigible will blowup on the mooring mast like the @CAPS1. So they just put it aside and made over time the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for the use by the sightseers.	1	1		1																					
15936	6	"There were three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. The first obstacle was ""nature itself"", meaning that the air currents at the top of the Empire State building were so powerful that the wind was constantly changing directions. This meant that if a dirigible could somehow fly through the winds and could be tied to the mast it would ""swivel around and around"" and would end up ""dangling over pedestrians"" which ""was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, A dirigible is not leagally allowed to dock at the mooring mast because it would be ""flying too low over urban areas"" Which there is an ""existing law"" against. This is a problem for the builders because no matter how hard they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock, they would not be leagally allowed to dock dirigibles at the Mooring Mast. Lastly, many dirigibles used hydrogen gas as a feul. Hydrogen gas is ""highly flammable"" and a dirigible using hydrogen gas is therefore also highly flammable and could potentially pose a disaster to the ""densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Because of potential fires, city laws, and air currents, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with obstacles when they tried to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast"	4	3		4																					
15939	6	work face many problems with building docks for dirigibles to land on docks attched to the Empire State building. In paragraph @NUM1 it states that dirigibles disappeared and did become the transportation of the future. The Empire State building Never got to forfill its purposes for dirigibles.	1	0		1																					
15952	6	"In, The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that the architects could not drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. This means the still frame would have to be modified and strengthened. Another setback was that most blimps from outside the United States used hydrogen and hydrogen is highly flammable.Nature itself was the greatest obstacle. The winds on top on the building were always shifting due to the violent air current. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. Lead weights were an option, but using these, where they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street, was not safe. The other practical reason why blimps could not more at the Empire State building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."	4	3		4																					
15953	6	"There was many different obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle faced was to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area.

Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" When the dirigibles would try to dock, they sometimes could not even get close to the building because of the strong winds By having the dirigibles hanging over pedestrians on the streets of New York, it was considered unpractical and unsafe. Due to mother nature and safety reasons, the builders of the Empire State building faced a few problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there"	4	3		3																					
15962	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to adopt there was very hard for them. A dirigible having to dock on the Empire State Building is probably not easy. A mooring mast added to the top of the building. Would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling. The obstacles were that Al Smith demanded the builders to make the Empire State Building more tall. Also to make it more ornamental, and to put in like a pyramid at the top. The workers were exhausted. The one obstacle that the builders did was to expand their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The other obstacles were that the architects and the builders of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was by nature itself."	2	1		2																					
15968	6	"There are a couple of obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles is that it would add stress to the building's Frame. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". Another obstacle was that the steel would have to be modified. ""The steel of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.""

15975	6	"Although the builders of the Empire State Building managed some of the obstacles with allowing dirigibles to dock there, many of the issues were left unsolved. When designing the mast to accommodate the blimp, the architects realized the pressure this would put on the building's frame. In order to support the weight of the dirigible they needed to make ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1) to the structure of the building. Also, the builders had to develop a way to tether the dirigible to the building to allow passengers and supplies to unboard. Therefore, the architects designed a ""rocket-shaped mast... of shiny aluminum... which also housed elevators and stairs"" (paragraph @NUM2). However, the builders forgot to incorporate the winds at the top of the building. Once the front of the dirigible was docked, the back of the blimp would swivel around irradically. Furthermore, the builders disregarded existing laws that banned dirigibles from flying low over cities, as it states in paragraph @NUM3. This precaution was due to the safety hazard that these dirigibles posed since they were highly flammable from the hydrogen used. These imposing obstacles made the use of the Empire State Building is a dock unrealistic."	3	3		3																					
15986	6	"It was once said ""were there is a will there is a way"". How ever they didn't include the part about the obstacles you will have to go through. For instance how the was a will & way for the docking of dirigibles on the Empire state building, the architects just didn't work out all the possible problems of their idea. Like the fact that only American dirigibles used helium instead of hydrogen. Also that the wind currents have a stronger force that high up in the air than to regular life level. Also the un-ideal place they were trying to use. They should've taken heed to the businessman's slogan ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1."""	1	2		2																					
15996	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders of the empire state building would of faced many consequences in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

15997	6	"Other than making ammendments to building plans, the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in safety, practicality, and legality. The hydrogen used in most foreign dirigibles is highly flammable, posing as an extreme safety hazard ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Also, due to natural, violent wind currents at the altitude of the mooring mast, it would be more difficult, and dangerous, to weigh down docking dirigibles. Lastly, the building plans for the Empire State building did not correspond to existing laws. Laws forbade airships from traveling at low altitudes over urban areas; therefore the use of the mooring mast would be illegal. Before the builders were able to finish the Empire state building, they had to carefully consider each of these obstacles."	3	3		3																					
16006	6	"In this short passage, it discusses how architects want to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building in the state of New York. This mast would dock dirigibles, which in modern day they're called blimps. The mooring mast is a skinny tower at the top of the Empire State Building to dock the Dirigibles. Empire State Building stands @NUM1 feet tall without the mooring mast at peak.The stress of a dirigible on a mooring mast at @NUM2 feet is a lot of weight at that high of a structure. They put @MONEY1 of modifications into this deal for the base area of the building.An important downfall about the dirigibles are that with helium in them, they're very flammable and could cost several millions in damage. If the zeppelin caught on flame over such a densely populated land area, that could take a large amount of lives.I think the mooring mast was a great idea and it helped the building be the tallest building at one time. They should still use the mooring mast today."	2	3		3																					
16011	6	"Throughout the excerpt, obstacles the builders faced were difficult. Many fell under being able to let dirigibles dock there. Some difficulties the faced were that outside from the states, more dirigibles were being made, but with ""hydrogen rather than helium"". they stated, ""hydrogen is highly flamable"". There was fear for the people, since New York was so densely populated. There were also whether problems. Winds were constantly shifting. ""Ship would swival around and around"". Realizing the danger, all they could do was shut it down."	2	2		2																					
16017	6	"When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to construct a mooring mast for dirigibles, they were faced with several obstacles that would ultimately defeat them. The first and most obvious obstacle was the danger of crashing. When the Hindenburg crashed in New Jersey, the builders realized how much worse the horrific crash would have been in downtown New York. Another more present obstacle was the wind at the top of the tower. As said in paragraph @NUM1 ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" That coupled with the lightweight nature of dirigibles would make mooring much more difficult than on an open field. The last obstacle faced by builders was the existing laws that made it illegal.

16049	6	"When building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the architects experienced many obstacles. These obstacles lead the designers to never effectively use the mooring mast like they had hoped to. The first problem they had, was that a thousand ton dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame. The designers had to spend @MONEY1 to reinforce the building's frameworks. This first obstacle already put doubt into the builders minds, that this was not going to happen easily. The next thing they realized, was that with hydrogen dirigibles is that they were extremely flamable. If a huge dirigible were to catch fire and fall onto New York City it would be cataustrophic. This also leasoned their enthusiasm about the work, knowing about how great a risk this would be. The wind above the building were constantly Shifting due to air currents, and this would toss and turn the dirigible tethered to the mast. The designers relized this would be neither practical or safe being over pedestrians on the ground. The last obstacle of all, that really killed their mooring idea, was airship laws. The law states that the dirigibles cannot fly that low over urban areas, so that puts an illegal mark on their plans.

""flying to low over urban areas"" was illegall so it would be impossible for a dirigible to even go near the Empire State Building. Lastly, the biggest obstacle was safety. Blimps that were being flown around New York were made using hydrogen, which is flamable. Also, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It wouldn't be safe to hook a blimp up in those winds where it would be shifting all around. Ofcourse, it was also a safety hazard because thousands of pedestrians would be walking on the road below, ""Where [the dirigibles] would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" it would be terrible if one fell.

Another problem was that other countries still used hydrogen and an explosion over New York would be devastating.One of the greatest obstacles was ""nature itself."" Winds at the top were constantly changing. The back of the ship would move around  the mooring mast. They had to solve this in a safe manner. In fields the back of a dirigible would be weighed down by lead, but this could not be done. It would be unsafe to allow the lead to dangle over civilians' heads. On top of all these obstacles, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

By this, Lüsted means that there are many violent air currents at the top of the building, meaning that the ship would swivel around and around.

Since the building was not ordinarily designed for this role, modifications would have to be made to its foundation.

Finally constant changes in wind current and other weather made a safe docking at the Empire State Building nearly impossible because the dirigible might get blown into the sharp roofs of nearby buidings and instead of being weighted down by lead like they would when they landed in fields as they normally would, they would be tied up, dangling over pedestrians."	3	2		3

These changes were quickly made, but safety concerns such as a potential fire or ""flying too low over urban areas"", (which was actually illegal), still prevailed. The ""greatest obstacle"" of building the mast was the violent winds that surrounded the Empire State Building. These winds were ""constantly shifting"", making it virtually impossible to stay in one spot without swiveling around the building. In a city as densely populated as New York, it also wasn't even an option to weigh down dirigibles for landing.

An obstacle that the Building faced was New York's lack of a suitable landing area. Al seen an opportunity to get people to and from the Empire state building. Al seen it as something creative and new. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never fulfilled. No thought of safety was thought about before constructing the idea either. The greatest reason was most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium which is a higher @CAPS1 for flames. Also nature itself was a big problem the idea had safety problems and couldnt @CAPS1 flames in Downtown New York"	2	3		3

16252	6	"While builders tried to figure out a way for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, there were some obstacles faced. If a dirigible was held by a single cable, this would add stress to the building's frame. The dirigible would have to be cabled at the top which was also difficult because of the Empire State's flat roof. Also weather was a huge obstacle. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1, line @NUM2) The wind would cause the dirigible to sway and not be very stable. Builders had to also keep in mind that using the building could be harmful to pedestrians as well, the dirigibles would be too close to the ground. The planning of where these aircrafts to land and re-fill was not an easy task for the builders."	3	2		3																					
16256	6	"The Empire State Building was in construction the building passed for many obstacles. First, because they wanted to do the biggest build in the world and they had to work hard.

16258	6	"Obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were problems such as strong winds a weak structure and public safety. The strong winds would almost make it imposible to hold it steady at the top while the weak structure would almost make it imposible to hold saflley at the top. with all of these hazards it is compleatly unsafe for people to ride, dock, and board these massive dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building."	3	2		3																					
16261	6	"During the process of building the Empire State Building, the builders had to go through obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. Some of these obstacles were changing the design of the building, thinking about the safety of people, and the material the dirigibles were made of. Since a thousand-foot dirigible that moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame, the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened. Over sixty thousand dollars work of modifications had to be spent. A dirigible was a steel framed  balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium. This was a safety issue; Most dirigibles used hydrogen, rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire, and the owners of the Empire State Building realzed how bad an accident like that could be over downtown New York. During construction of the Empire State Building, builders had to go through many obstacles just to attempt to allow dirigible to dock there."	3	2		3																					
16264	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some minor obstacles were the frame and strength of the building. Other obstacles were major such as nature which cannot be controlled. In paragraph nine the author explains that if a thousand-foot dirigibles were to be moored to the top of the Empire State Building it would add stress to the building's frame. Also with wind pressure the building's foundation would be affected. In order to allow dirigibles to dock, the frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened. As nature as a great affect on the use of the mooring mast it would be almost impossible for dirigibles to be tethered onto the building. The wind would send the dirigibles swiveling around the mooring mast as the author describes in paragraph fourteen.      Other obstacles the builders faced were most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, most landing fields weighed down the back of the blimps would lead weight (which wouldn't be safe to have dangling over pedestrians), the last problem was there was an existing law againts airships flying low over urban areas.

In the excerpt it States that the mooring mast was not originally part of the design structure for the Empire State Building: however the stresses it would cause in docking a dirigible ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" This means that the builders would need to design Some way of doing this when the building was already begun. Other @CAPS1 included those of safety. The exerpt tells that ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen"" which is more flammable than helium. This combined with the fact that there really was no way of securing the tale of a dirigible moored at the mast could cause an accident @CAPS2 to that of the Hindenburg over a ""densely populated area Such as downtown New York"""	2	3		3

Owners of the building realized if an accident like the Hindenburg were to take place above a densely populated city or area such as downtown New York, results would have been far worst. Builders greatest obstacle would be nature itself. Winds atop the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the air ship could tether to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast.

One obsticle was that in order to build it for docking dirigibles, they had to spend over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. Also, another obsticle was because of the safety. Dirigibles were not that safe, they were flameable and would be over an area with many other buildings and people around.

One of these obstacles being stress. Yes, stress. This is because when you have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State building, only by which is held by a single cable tether, it adds stress to the frame of the building. Another obstacle the builders faced was safety. Seeing as most dirigibles have been known to use hydrogen rather than helium, you would think hydrogen is the one to go with. Unfortunately, hydrogen is a fire caution because it is extremely flamable. So safety was definitely another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. A final obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. This is simply because the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, on repeat because violent currents would constantly shifting the winds on the top of the building. There would be no solution, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast. These are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, in the informative excerpt, The Mooring Mast by, Marcia Amidon Lüsted."	3	4		4

Another obstacle was the dirigibles was held by a single cable tether and that would add stress to the building's frame. Next, New York City would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Then the greatest reason of safety came upon them. That was, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. And hydrogen is highly flammable. On @DATE1 a German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire state building realized if that happened to New York and how big of a problem that would cause. The final and greatest obstacle they faced to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. From all the violent wind and air currents would be hard to tether the dirigibles to the mast. In conclusion, those were the obstacles the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there."	4	4		4																					
16278	6	"There were several major obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such problem was that, ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."". It cost over @MONEY1 to make the modifications nesescary to do this. Also, the, ""roof had to be completed before the framing of the mooring mast could take place."" @CAPS1, they did not solve several other obstacles. Forein dirigibles normally ""used hydrogen rather than helium..."" And this would cause vast damage if they crashed in ""a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" In addition, being so high, the dirigible could not be weighted down in the back and thus would swivll around the mast. There was also a law prohibiting ""airships flying too low over urban areas.

16285	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock thousands of feet above the New York streets. One of their many problems was the sheer size of the dirigibles, somewhere as long as one-thousand feet. Another problem they faced was keeping the back of the ship from swiveling around the mooring mast. Usually, the backs of these blimp-like structure's were anchored down by lead weights, but to have lead weights dangling high above the streets was way to risky not to mention unpractical."	2	2		2																					
16290	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous problems dealing with the mooring mast. First of all, I would say safety was the number one issue. If the dirigible were to catch on fire, it could land on the main streets of New York City, posing a hazard to hundreds of pedestrians. Also, the weather was another factor. If it were too windy to fly all the time, then the mast would be a waste. When I read that they had to spend <@NUM1</@CAPS1> to modify the building's framework,""  I started thinking of all the other things a town could do with @MONEY1.

They would need to spend over @MONEY1 in order to modify the building's framework. Another issue, ofcourse, was the safety of the mast. Most of the zeppelins from places besides the U.S., did not use helium. Instead, those limbs used hydrogen which is highly flamable and would have caused disaster if ignited above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.

Another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was the laws about airships flying too low over urban areas. Not only was it illegal, but also unsafe. Most dirigibles from out of the United States were made with a highly flammable gas called hydrogen. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey.

16346	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast on top of the building. The main problem was perhaps that foreign dirigibles don't use helium, they use hydrogen. Using hydrogen was a huge problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable. If a problem did occur, hypothetically, that a dirigible caught fire it would cause a threat to New York City which is highly populated. If the dirigible blew up the people of New York would not have enough time to get away from the blast. Another problem was winds. Winds can easily blow the dirigible off its course of worse into a spire on top of a building and puncture it.

16387	6	Al Smith's idea of making the Empire State Building bigger was a very difficult task. Also tying to make the top of the building a docking area for new airships was difficult. One obstacles the builders faced attempting to create a dock for dirigibles was preventing stress to the buildings frame. If the builders wanted to fix that it will invole the the building's foundation which was eleven hundred feet below. The framework of the building will cost too much money. The stress of the building will come from the dirigibles's load and wind pressure. Another Obstacle that the builders were faced with was the wind. The violent air current would cause the building to constinously shift. They didnt wand to use lead weights because it was to dangerous. because they were dangling high over predestrains. A law that builders had to think about while building this was the law that went against airships flying too low They had many obstacles that the builders had to keep in mind while building the dock.	3	3		3

When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to dock at the building, the wind wouldn't allow it to get close enough without moving out of control like hitting another building. This made it impossible for the dirigible to dock and so the Los Angeles gave up. Another reason builders faced a problem with with @CAPS1 dirigibles to dock on the empire state building, was that there was a law that said airships were not @CAPS2 to fly low over urban areas.

The first problem, of many, was that they could not just plop a mast on the top because it would be to unstable and cause to much stress to the structure. To prevent that what they ended up doing was modifying and strengthening the structure as a whole costing over sixty thousand dollars. Once they figured out how to equal out all of the wind pressure, they had to think of how to bring the dirigibles in, the answer was simple electrical winches. The next problem was safty, dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION1 used highly flammable hydrogen and if that blew up it would not be good for the densely populated city below. Another safety issue was nature's violently shifting winds and to solve the problem on the ground they would waive the back down with lead weights to keep it from sweying, but doing that in the air over a lot of people could be unsafe.

16422	6	"The obstacles which the builders of the empire state building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous for this project. The first problem was that, other dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is a much more flammable substance than helium, which is what dirigibles in the United States used. The owners didn't want anything to occur similar to the German dirigible the Hindenburg, which would be worse in downtown New York instead of Lakehurst, New Jersey. Another practical reason why dirigibles faced problems docking at the Empire State building was that an existing law prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas. For example a @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible named the Los Angeles, could not get close enough to tie up due to forceful winds. These problems go to show that owners of the Empire State building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there."	3	3		3																					
16431	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that the had to be modified and strengthened. This cost them over @MONEY1 worth of modifications. They had to make these modifications so the dirigible can dock. All in All, these are the obstacles the builders of the Empire state building face in attempting to allow dirigible to dock."	1	2		2																					
16447	6	"The Empire State Building faced various obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most importantly was the danger involved in this ambitious plan. Blimps from outside the @LOCATION3 commonly used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. After a German dirigible destroyed in a fire, owners of the Empire State Building saw the true danagers of an accident like this in downtown New York. Successful use of the mooring mast was another obstacle. The winds at such a high altitude made it difficult to dock. Once docked the dirigibles would have to dangle above pedestrians, which was ""neither pratical or safe"". The existing law against airships flying to low in urban areas create further probles. After the Los Angeles failed to reach the mooring mast because of the high winds the owners started to see the unsolved problems. By the late 1930's the idea had ""quietly disappeared""."	4	3		4																					
16454	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced a few main obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there atop the building. These three main obstacles where the designing of the mast and the building modifications, safety, and existing laws about aircrafts. The designing of the mast was an obstacle because a dirigible moored to the mast would add stress to the building's frame. The load and pressure had to be transmitted to the base of the building and they faced ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications"" to do so. One of the other problems was, most importantly, safety. The article states that most countries used hydrogen in their balloons to stay afloat, unlike the United States who used helium. This was dangerous for hydrogen is flammable, and the building owners did not want a repeat of the Hindenburg accident when a German dirigible was destroyed by fire. Also, a dirigible had to be weighted down or it'd spin around the mast and the commonly used lead weights were a hazard for pedestrians below. The last main obstacle of the Empire State building's builders was the existing law banning airships from flying low above urban areas. It would be illegal for a dirigible to approach the area let alone tether to the building. These are three of the main obstacles which the builders faced in building the Empire State building and its mast. Design, safety, and legal issues all were obstacles which got the better of the builders."	4	4		4																					
16461	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles so the dirigibles could safely dock at the top to refuel or repair. People were thrilled for this idea, yet they knew how difficult this task would be. First of all, the building plan had to be redone due to the Chrysler building's builders tactic about sneaking around to make the building taller than the Empire State Building. Al Smith was not going to let that happen so he decided to make the @CAPS1.S.B. even taller. (1,250 ft.) secondly, the builders had to come up with a way to build the dock on a stable platform because it was unstable on the flat roof. This served as and obsticle because at such a height, construction is hard to do. Al Smith was more than determined though which enlightened the workers stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""over sixty thousand dollars"" worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework (Lüsted, @NUM1). Also, the dock or landing dock, could not be used weather permitting. The dirigibles so close to the city, building, and civilians was dangerous when swaying around. The author says, ""some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City"" (6). There were violent wind currents that could make the dirigibles sway around the mooring mast. Last of all, an existing law against airships flying that low over urban areas was in place. This is a major contributor to the failed attempt. Being prohibited and breaking the law would get many in trouble. All and all, the attempt made by the architects of the Empire State Building proved dedication and good intentions, but their ideas were too irrational for the dock to become successful in society."	3	3		3																					
16463	6	"It was unfortunate that such a great idea was never able to succeed. The builders of the Empire State building faced with many difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. First they had to design the Mask which sounds like a long and complicated process. Everything seemed as if it was going to work out. Builders started construction. After two months of construction, the mooring mast was not able to fulfill its purpose for several reasons. hydrogen is highly flammible and to dangerous to use in such a highly populated area. Things such as wind and nature itself would have made this wonderful idea impossible. There were laws that would have never allowed for this to happen anyway. If builders and planners had done better research they would have found this project to have been impossible before going through all the intense construction."	3	3		3																					
16468	6	The builders of the empire State building faced alot of obstacles. One problem they had was when & if they landed getting an area for the people to get on and off. they had to make the platform bigger also. When the dirigibles landed it was because they needed more fuel @CAPS1 it would only be a couple hours they were stopped.	1	0		1																					
16471	6	"When designing the Empire State Building, architect Al Smith had the idea of futuristic Dirigible travel in mind. However, he faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at this giant building, as described in The Mooring Mast. Mooring a dirigible to the top of it ""... would add stress to the building's frame."" In order to allow dirigibles to dock, Smith had to modify the buildings frame: transmitting pressure all the way down to the foundation. Smith also faced the issue of foreign balloons; most of which used the highly flammable hydrogen, Instead of helium. A fire caused by a dirigible docked to the Empire State Building would rapidy spread to the city. Smith found that nature caused problems as well. Due to the changing winds atop the building, ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" @CAPS1 pedestrians. Because of all these obstacles, the idea of a dirigible mooring was given up, but the mast remains today. "	3	3		3																					
16473	6	"In the excerpt, ""The @CAPS1 Mast,"" by @PERSON1, the architects of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.One of the problems the builders encountered was that the dirigible didn't have a suitable landing area. The architechs concluded that they couldn't just drop a @CAPS1 mast on top of their building, because it would add stress to its frame, so they had to strengthen, and modify it to make it work.Another obstacle. was the fact that most dirigibles ran on hydrogen, which is highly flamable. The builders realized how dangerous that could be, especially above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. They also realized that nature itself was their biggest obstace. Winds were constatly shifting due to violent air currents and they knew that this idea was neither practical nor safe. Lastly, There was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would make their idea illegal and unsuccessful."	3	3		3																					
16475	6	"When the construction of the Mooring Mast on the Empire State Building was completed the builders began to face problems that should have been apparent from the begining. Some of the problems faced was there is a law in the U.S. that doesnt let aircraft fly close to or around cities and buildings. This meant they wouldn't be able to have the blimps tethered to the mast anyway. The highly violent and constantly changing weather and wind also posed a problem because it would be blowing the blimp everywhere, and its could not be weighed down with lead blocks like on land because it wouldn't be safe having them hang over the city. With the winds being crazy the blimp (most of them filled with hydrogen) could be punctured and set ablaze following towards the people on the ground. With those @CAPS1 being some of the most obvious problems some would think they wouldn't have attempted it but those obsticles were never overcome and the mooring mast still sits unused."	3	2		3																					
16476	6	"The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 is about the Empire State Building and the expectations that people had for it. In @DATE1 it was announced that the Empire State Building would reach the height of 1,250 feet. The point of the selection is to show that there was another idea that the Empire State building builders were trying to make a reality. The builders came across some obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the building not being stable enough to support the dirigibles, having to add frame work, and the possible dangers of making this idea a reality. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add too much stress to the buildings frame."". Because of this added stress ""the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened.""

16480	6	"The construction workers faced many obstacles in building the Empire State building. One of those obstacles was hieght. Since they wanted to make the building the tallest building in the world they had to make sure there was enough technology to do so. Also they had to add an extra seventeen flores to the building making it 102 floors instead of its original @NUM1 floors. Another obstacle was its safety issues. The construction workers never checked into problems with building the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the author States, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to afixed mass at such a height made it describable to post pone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" the author is trying to say that when designing the production of the mooring mass; ""they overlooked certain issues that make them set back the final date.

The frame was not strong enough to undergo the stress and wind pressure from the load of the dirigible. The foundation of the building, which was approximately @NUM1 feet below, would have had to be strengthened and modified if it was going to be able to handle the movement of the dirigible attached by a single cable tether. Safety was the greatest obstacle that the builders faced most dirigibles used hydrogen to make them lighter than the air. However, this hydrogen was highly flammable causing many dangers. Since New York City is such a thickly settled area, the risk of a fire was too dangerous to take. Finally, instead of dirigibles landing in open fields they would have to dock eleven hundred feet above the ground in the words of Marcia Amidon Lüsted, ""using these (dirigibles) at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."""	4	3		4																					
16486	6	The builders had to go through many obstacles to @CAPS1 to allow the dirigible to dock on the @ORGANIZATION2.

There was also the safty of it being up there. There was already a fire from another dirigible catching on fire. The gases inside are really flamable and that would make a really big problem. The last thing that they had to conider was if Airships were to Low.

The hydrogen made it much more dangerous to have in the crowded down town New York area, because hydrogen was much more flamable. a third obstacl was the winds as said ""the winds on top of the building were constantley shifting due to violent air currents.""

A lot of dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen which is highly flammable and different accident like in New Jersey, where the blimp caught fire, were to happen in the heavely populated New York a lot of injuries and deaths would occur. A third reason is nature. Since the building stood so tall, wind speeds and pressure was very unpredictable, especially with the violent air currents.

The Empire State building builders did not want to take their chances over such a populated area.In paragraph fourteen, the reader learns that wind speed at the top of the building far surpassed wind speed in other places that dirigibles could be docked. This was a problem because when they normally tied down the back end of the dirigible with a rope & led, they could no longer do because of the location that they desire to dock it.

Another reason was safety. In 1937 the German dirigible, Hindenburg, went down because of a fire. That situation could've been a lot worse if they dirigible went down on heavily populated areas, in which thousands of people might die.

16600	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" there were some obsticales that the builders faced. Some of the obsticales that were faced had to do with the strength of the frame. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast to top the the buildings flat roof because it would stress the frame to much. So over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had been made to the buildings frame work. Anothe obsticae the mooring mast was never destined to fulfill its purpose."	1	1		1																					
16601	6	"The architects building the Empire State Building incountered a big problem when trying to put the mooring mast on the very top. The second sentence in paragraph @CAPS1 states, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Although the architects faced many problems this was the biggest. This ment that they would have to change the buildings structure in order to make it work. It says in the bottom of paragraph @CAPS1 that over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made."	1	2		2																					
16607	6	"In The ""Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 many problems with the mast of the Empire State building are explained. One of the many problems was that the large deregible tied to the building mast would add stress to the building which could cause the building to collapse. But this problem was fixed by strengthening the building's foundation. A second problem with docking a dirigible at the Empire State building was the highly flammable gases the dirigible used to become lighter than air. If the dirigible were to catch fire its metal frame could fall to the ground endangering citizens below. The last danger would be that while the dirigible was docked strong air currents coming off of the building could cause the dirigible's tail to spin around on the mast. One way to fix this would be to Place lead weights on the back of the ship. But if one of these weights fell off of the dirigible it could potentially harm pedestrians below. Because of these problems the mast could never be used."	3	3		3																					
16610	6	The builders faced many problems that should have been foreseen. Perhaps the greatest reason was because @CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium as their gas choice. Because hydrogen is highly flammable it would have spelled doom for New York if exploded. The weather also created a great risk. If a dirigible dock there the violent air currents would shifted constantly. The use of lead weights would put pedestrians at risk. That idea was neither safe or practical. Probably one of the most obvious risks was the law. There was a law that stated that airships can fly to low over urban areas. Because of these reasons it made making the Empire State Building a landing area unsafe.	3	3		3																					
16616	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced a few problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one of the first problems they faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (Lüsted, @NUM1). The builders would have to keep this in mind. The next obstacle they faced was nature and its winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents,"" (@NUM2). The winds would be a major problem that the builders would have to face because it is so unpredictable. Lastly, the builders had to worry about the law pertaining to airships flying too low over urban areas ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,"" (@NUM3). The builders of the Empire State Building had to face the difficulties of safety, nature, and the law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."	4	3		4																					
16630	6	"Some of the problems with the constructing of docking dirigibles were that, natural causes like high winds said in ¶ 6. The dirigibles were highly flammable due to the use of hydrogen gases that made the dirigibles fly. Also another important factor was that this project was being taken place in a highly populated area, which meant harm could be done civilians if anything ever went wrong."	1	2		2																					
20716	8	 A long time ago when I was in third grade I had a friend @PERSON2 who's mom was in a bad mood. She never laughed and she never smiled. Every time I saw her I would smile at her and all she would do was frown and keep walking. At first I didn't know she was a grouch i just thought she didn't like me or something.When @PERSON2 told me his mom was a grouch I started to laugh and laugh. He asked me what was so funny i told him that i thought his mom didn't like me or something because every time I see his mom I would smile at her and all she will do is frown and walk away. That made my friend laugh we were cracking up so hard that we got in trouble in class.   The next day @PERSON2 and I were eating lunch at school when he says to me &lt;hey your pretty good at making people laugh&gt;. I said &lt;no I am not my jokesare horrible&gt;. He said &lt;@CAPS1 lets put them to the test go up to some one new to this school&gt;. I said @CAPS1 so we went around the whole school looking for a new student unfortunately we couldn't find one we heard the bell ring and we ran to our class. We sat in the back of the classroom its only @PERSON2 and I and anempty seat between us. We were excited because our teacher @PERSON1 was going to show us a movie. @PERSON1 got the front of the room andclass today I have an announcement we have a new student in our class say hello to @LOCATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 walked through the door. @PERSON1 told @ORGANIZATION1 shecould sit in the back in between @PERSON2 and I. She sat down turned to the both of us and said hello. @PERSON2 gave me a look that said tell her the joke and @CAPS3 him a thumbs up. I turned to @LOCATION1 and said hi I'm @CAPS4 do you want to hear a joke. @ORGANIZATION1 said yeah sure. I started &lt;@CAPS5 knockshe said &lt;who's thereI said &lt;booshe said &lt;boo who?I said &lt;oh don't cry I am right here&gt;. At first she didn't laugh because she didn't get it but duringthe middle of the movie she said &lt;ohhhh I get itand she started to laugh. @PERSON2 turned to me and said &lt;I told you so&gt;.   @PERSON2 got this crazy idea that if I spent the night at his house that I could make his mom laugh or at least make her smile. I said &lt;@CAPS1 sounds like a plan&gt;. I asked mt mom if it was @CAPS1 if I could spend the night at @PERSON2 house she said &lt;yeah just make sure its @CAPS1 with his mom&gt;. @PERSON2 asked his mom she said it was @CAPS1. When I got to @PERSON2 house the first thing we did was play video games. When it was dinner time we all sat down at the table to eat @PERSON2 and I were on one side and his parents on the other. When we started eating @PERSON2 told me to tell the joke to his parents i said @CAPS1. So I said to them &lt;@CAPS5 @CAPS5&gt;they replied &lt;who's thereI said &lt;boothey said &lt;boo who?I said &lt;oh don't cry I am right here&gt;. His parents started to laugh and laugh and they keptlaughing for like five minutes. @PERSON2 turned to me and yelled it worked his mom asked what worked. @PERSON2 explained everything to them. His mom told usthat her mom had recently died and that's why she was in a bad mood. After dinner we went to bed and fell asleep. The next morning when my mom came to pick me up she asked me how the sleep over went. I said it was fun I made people laugh. She said @CAPS1 but laughter isn't going to help you clean your roomall i could say was gosh darn it.             FIN	18	16		34				4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	3	3						
20725	8	" I believe that with all people laughter, and having a sense of humor, is something that generally everyone has in common, everyone loves to share with others. Among young teenage girls, laughter is a commodity that is infectious but always wonderful. It's the purest kind of joy we have, it's somethings that brings humans together. It's the beginning and end of friendship and unity. Laughter can ring out and lift the spirits of those that really need it. A simple laugh can make the worst day a little alright. We all know that feeling of dread, and sadness . The kindness, generosity, and good of laughter is one of the few things that are right nowadays. Even in poverty, depression, and oppression the simple joy of laughter can wash away a person's worries for a split second and fill us with utter warmth.  @PERSON1 and I have been the best of friends since we were ten-years-old, and laughter has always been our strongest element. @PERSON1 and I have a knack for making each other burst out in laughter when all we want to do is be angry or just cry. We've decided that apart, we're just a little funny, but with our powers combined we could make anyone laugh. We use that power on each other when we're having bad days, or we simply need some cheering up. I think if it wasn't for laughter we wouldn't even be friends anymore. It really is what brings us together as best friends. We'd be different people. Even if I drifted from her we'd always be cracking jokes, making each others guts hurt, and tearing up from laughing so hard.  My first impression of @PERSON1 was of her stomping down to our neighborhood park to yell at her sister, whom I had been playing with at the time. It would be a very self-explanatory reason of why I didn't like her at first. Luckily, after going to @PERSON1's house with her sister, @PERSON1 and I found that we had many things in common, and we were only four months apart. That childish kind of cajoling held our friendship together, for it was a bit rocky at the beginning. Always fighting, and arguing about things that now, we look back on and laugh at our adolescent stupidity. Either one of us would be popping off with dumb little comments at each other when neither of us wanted to apologize. One time she proceeded to tell me that I couldn't hear her because I had a big bug in my ear. Now we can remind each other of things like that and have a good ole time laughing about it. We were mere @NUM1-year-old's then. Now, almost @NUM2, we rarely fight, but we always laugh and make the best of what we've got with our poking fun. Laughter was definitely the band-aid in the beginning of our rickety friendship. @PERSON1 has a gift to make anything funny at any time. She says the wrong (but hilarious) things, but always at the right time. Laughter is now a necessity between us, it's what keeps our friendship so strong. I think of what the human race would be like if laughter was not a factor in everyday life. Everyone knows that it wasn't a good day if you haven't laughed or let alone smiled. People would be dull, and just unhappy. Laughter heals people from sickness, it gives us the feeling that maybe everything is going to be okay after all. I truly believe that it's healthy for you. With a flip of a switch, laughing can bring within us an ecstatic, and serendipitous feeling. People take it for granted and use it for wrong when it's meant to spread the word of happiness. We're lucky to have a gift of such natural joy. Can anyone even explain, in detail, the feeling laughter truly brings us? I think not. It's like describing the scent of something. You just can't do it. The words aren't there. I think of those poor and miserable people that have forgotten what it feels like to laugh, and it's very sad. I strive to laugh every single day, and make at least one other person laugh. What is a life without a diamond in the rough like laughter? It's no life at all, for laughter will always be your shelter on the pursuit of happiness."	21	20		41				4	5	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20733	8	" People always say laughter is a big part in a relationship. Is it true? In my opinion I am not so sure, but my grandmother says laughter is always a huge part in a relationship. Makes a you feel good when you make your best friend, parents, boyfriend or girlfriend laugh. It is the best feeling ever because you know how to put a smile on that person. Have you ever been walking around a store and you spot two couples laughing , having fun? I have and sometimes i feel like being in that same place. My grandmother always tells me her stories about her and my grandpa when they were young. She always says ""laughter plays a big part in our relationship"".  She was @NUM1 and @CAPS1 was @NUM2 the first time they met. Everyone always said they were never going to last, but the only way they could find out is to wait and believe. She felt like singing everytime she heard his name. She said she would walk into their shadows with him. She felt like all her problems would go away, everytime she had the chance to hang out with him. Everytime she could think about him she would smile and laugh. Thats how happy she felt about him. Can we call it love? I say it was, sometimes I wish I was in love like my grandmother is. She seems so happy everytime she talks about him, but i still dont know if laughter is @CAPS2 kept them together for so long. I see a really huge smile on my grandmother everytime she says, ""@CAPS1 didn't have the brightest head in the world, but @CAPS1 always knew how put a smile on my face"". Because she says that @CAPS1 wasn't so smart but @CAPS1 knew how to make jokes, and make her laugh. A question she asked me once ""@CAPS2 do you think of two couples when you see them laughing, having a good time"". The first thing that pops to your head is that they know how to have fun and doesnt let anything get in their ways of laughing and having a goodtimes. My grandmother says that the thing that kept her and my grandpa together was laughter, because if you dont know howe to make the other person laugh you dont know if you could have a good time with that person. When my grandparents are mad at each other it never last to long because my gandpa always knows how to make her laugh. Maybe if they didn't know how to make each other laugh than maybe they wouldnt be together still. I understand now my grandmother felt in love with my grandpa, because of how @CAPS1 made her laugh. In a relationship you always have to know how to put a smile on the other person, because if you dont know than pretty sure things will not work out. My grandmother was right, laughter does play a big part in their relationship.They alwasy know how to make everything better by making jokes or by doing something funny. I can never be mad at my grandparents because they know so many tricks to make my self laugh. That's @CAPS2 makes our family relationship stick together, and other familys also.I finally get it laughter is a big part in a relationship."	18	18		36				3	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	3						
20736	8	"               ""Laughter"" A good relationship is built on trust, right? That's what I've heard my whole life, but as I've grow and really started thinking for myself I came up with my own kind of survival guide, if you will, to good relationships for anyone. Sure trust is important but @CAPS2 isn't the only key factor, I've learned laughter is just as important to not only starting a relationship but keeping @CAPS2 full of life. One person in my life helped me really understand that and be able to have that relationship with them. My mom and I have such a great bond and way of understanding with each other, other girls I know don't always have that with their mothers, I am very fortunate. Sure we have hard times just like any family, but we are able tolaugh @CAPS2 off with time and start new. @CAPS5 helped me realize, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""  @CAPS1 a great bond with my mom is so important to me, we have not always ran so smoothly though. From about age ten to thirteen I was a bit troubled in the sense of not wanting to show my emotions, I just wanted to stay quite.Then seeing my mom as someone who was strong and beautiful, I have to admit I was a bit worried @CAPS5 would think I was a disappointment. I guess I was afraid to show who I really was to her. Whenever @CAPS5 would joke around with me I would take @CAPS2 all to seriously and whenever we would fight about small things I thought @CAPS5 would hate me forever. I know now I was silly to think that, but I'm actually glad we went through that. I think that's part of what made us stronger, like how there would be no rainbow without the rain or how there would be no happy ending if all was well throughout your whole life. Little did I know the light at the end of the tunnel was just around the corner. One night after dinner my mom had informed me that @CAPS2 was my night to do dishes, unlike usual I completely forgot and went to my room to listen to music and eventually fall asleep. My mother came in my room upset and frustrated. @CAPS5 said, ""@PERSON1, why did you ignore me? The dishes need to be done now."" I jumped out of bed without a word and began walking to the kitchen. @CAPS5 followed me into the small bright room, ""@PERSON1? Are you alright, @CAPS2's okay that you forgot. I'm not mad."" @CAPS5 exclaimed. Again not a word escaped my lips. I was afraid to say anything, the only sound that came from me was a sigh of relief when I turned back around and noted her absence. When I was finished with the dishes @CAPS5 pulled me into my room. I tried reading her face, @CAPS5 looked worried. @CAPS5 explained to me the relationship between her and her mom that @CAPS5 so desperately wanted to have with me. @CAPS5 told me about how they would @CAPS3 together over silly things and how they promised each other that when they got into fights they would stop themselves, take a deep breath, then @CAPS3. ""@CAPS3? What? Why would you guys do that?"" I questioned.  @CAPS5 replied, "" @CAPS4 laughter is the best cure for any sad feeling or bad day, as grandma would always say."" @CAPS5 helped me experience that by tickling me and joking around. For the fist time in my life I wasn't nervous and I spoke my mind. As we sat there and chucked ourselves to sleep I knew things would be different from here on out, and they were. We now have made that promise to one other and we are able to have wonderful smiling memories together now. Now at fifteen years old I can honestly say without question my mom will always be my best and truest friend. Our bond, our way of getting over tough times, and the way we can @CAPS3 off all stressful things in life makes me feel as if I can get through anything. I've truly realized the meaning of the saying, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" "	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
20741	8	" Everyone enjoys laughter. Everywhere you look there is always laughter. Laughter comes from being happy, and being happy comes from having joy in your life. Many times in my life I have had joy. I tend to laugh many times throughout the day on account of I am happy. One topic that brings me laughter is my niece. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 is two years old. She is the most adorable little girl in the world. At least in my opinion she is. Since she is so young she does not have a care or worry in the world. She knows everything is going to be taken care of. In this case she is full of joy, and happiness, which causes her laughter. When I am with her all that takes place is laughter, and playing. These are the greatest moments. @CAPS3 has this cookie jar, and when ever you put the shapes into the right slots it sings a silly little song. This song makes her laugh, and dance uncontrollably. Which in return gets me laughing. It soon ends up being a huge laugh fest. These are the greatest moments. Recently we had another addition added to the family. @PERSON1, my nephew, and @CAPS2 brother. As @PERSON1 gets older, he keeps learning new things, and @CAPS3 loves it. She laughs harder then ever. She thinks it is the funniest thing when he starts laughing. These are the greatest moments. As we can see laughter is happy, and fun. Laughter starts with smiling, and smiling is also rooted from being happy. Many things make me laugh and smile. My niece and nephew is just one example. What makes you laugh and smile?"	15	20		35				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20746	8	" In many relationships I have had, there has always been laughter, love, sadness, anger and complacations. Allthough there has been one person I had a relationship with that did not involve laughter and it was reather boring and sad. I would spend troumendous hours of my time to just get one little giggle or sound of laughter out of him. He was a rather gental soul and could never harm a fly, but still could not laugh eventhough he was happy. I would ask many times over and over ""are you sure your happy because you dont seem like it? I never see you smiling or laughing all I see is a frown"" I told him with a sour face and he replyed back ""yes, @CAPS1 I am happy but just becuase I don't laugh doesn't mean I am not and besides with that silly grin on your face, how could I not be happy?"" with that reply I simply just shrugged and began again. ""then why cant you not laugh?"" and he replyed back in a drowsy voice because he was gettig tired of the same topic everyday. ""its not that I can't laugh its that I choose not to"" and I said ""well why on earth would you do that?"" he sighed and huffed really getting tired of the topic. ""allright if you don't stop this"" he said in a gental but strained voice, ""im going to have to stop being so nice to you and I just might not talk to you for the rest of the year"" but of course he was only joking, he could never not be nice to me and besides he was my bestfriend he couldn't not talk to me. The topic was dropped and never brought up again until the @DATE1 I saw him. It was a cold @DATE2 when I walked out of my house one morning to go to school. I saw a big moving rental truck outside of his house and instandtly knew that he had not lied to me but rather did not tell me that he was moving away. I began to think that it was because of me always asking him why he would not laugh but that would be a silly reason to leave. I went over to his house not caring if I was late or never did show up for school that @DATE2, I had to figure out why he was leaving. Once I got to the porch of his house he was walking to the door and I blocked the door way so that he could not go any further making sure that if he wanted to get the box of clothes to the truck that he would have to answer me. I asked him and he said, ""my father got a promotion at work and now we have to move to new york"". I begain to cry as he told me this, I was young about eight years of age and he was twellve. I knew I was not going to get to see him again so I made sure that before I lefted to school that we would hang out before he lefted. That night at the park he told me willingly without me asking him. ""@CAPS1, I know you have always wondered why I dont luagh"" he said and went on ""like I said its not that I cant laugh its that I dont want to...I just...when I was young I was teased because of my smile"". I didnt understand, why would anyone tease him? so I asked ""why though? why would someone tease you, your nice"" and he repled ""because before my new teeth grew in my old ones didn't look so great"". And once again I was still puzzled his teeth looked good to me so I asked again ""then why don't you smile now your teeth look fine to me"" he said ""I would but I don't know after being teased for so many years I just didn't feel the need to and now well...I could smile and truth be told I want to"" I said ""really!?"" with too much excitment. ""yes, and the only reason is you, your about the only person that makes me want to smile, its because of that grin you always have your always so happy. I just couldnt admit it to myself well becasue your a girl and to me I guess having a girl make me want to amile and being my only friend that is younger than me makes me feel a little weak."" I didnt understand this at the time but now that I am older I do and I am so glad that I had that one night to see his smile and many phone calls to hear his laughter. I once heard that laughter is the shortest distance between two people and quite frankly it is absoultyl true becuase after that night our friendship grew even further with just a phone call a @DATE2 and a little laughter."	17	16		33				4	4	4	4	3	3	4	3	3	4	3	3						
20761	8	" Sometimes I wonder why people laugh. People laugh when something is funny or when things @CAPS3 awkward and they aren't sure what else to do. Often people laugh when they @CAPS3 embarrassed or offended. I, actually, find myself laughing for no reason on occasion. if I can make someone laugh I usually feel very accomplished. I think it personally shows emotions out loud. But, in some cases, you laugh uncontrollably at yourself. Every year, since i moved here six and @DATE1, my two cousins and my sisters and I have gone ""cheese ball caroling"" with our grandparents around @CAPS1 time. Even after my grandpa died in @DATE4 and my older sister left for college. On the twenty-first of @DATE2, we go secret @LOCATION1 shopping one at a time with one of our grandparents while we make the cheese balls by hand. After all five of us have gone, we wrap the cheese balls and put a ribbon on them while we practice our carols for that evening. We always make a list before we start the caroling. First thing on the list is the people who's houses we @CAPS3 going to go to that night. Second next to each families name is the number of cheese balls we will be delivering to that specific house. Third is what song we @CAPS3 going to sing to them. Usually, there is about twenty- five to thirty people on the list. All of which @CAPS3 family members and really close friends or people from their work. We always have a really good time with it too. No fighting or bickering or anything like that. It's really nice to just be with the family and catch up. Usually, it's been about a year since we have all been together at the same time. Last year was the first year we went caroling with out my older sister. She went off to college the @DATE3 before, leaving me the oldest grand kid there. At first it didn't seem any different, but as the day went on I could feel it taking it's tole. With her being gone and my grandpa no longer being around made the pressure build uncontrollably. I started to relax a little when we got started and just tried to have fun. My grandma yelled to me to grab the list and add a name. At first, I didn't think anything of it. Later she told us we had to come up with a special song for the family. And that's when it hit me. The name looked and sounded familiar because I used to go to school with a boy with the same last name. That's when I asked her to verify if it was the same family. Sure enough, it was. I had had a crush on this boy since I could remember. We lost contact after I had found out he liked my cousin though. I knew it was going to be extremely awkward to have to sing in front of him, not to mention embarrassing. I remember thinking ""@CAPS2 great, this is just what I needed. This is going to be awesome."" We did our rounds and everything went very smoothly. We were having tons of fun, making jokes and laughing at absolutely everything. Then it came time to go to ""his"" house. We all choked up. The girls had heard many things about how cute and dream like this boy was so they were all nervous too. We were sitting there in the truck telling ourselves he wont be home, and even if he was it would be fine and we would be fine. I think that was the longest walk to a house with that short of a walk way ever. My grandma rang the door bell and we positioned ourselves to be ready to sing when the door opened. To our dismay, he answered it. We froze! We were like gargoyles gawking at him. He gave us a weird look and said "" @CAPS3 you going to sing or just stand there?"" with an evil little smile. I did attempt to sing, but nothing came out. That's when the youngest cousin starts singing happy birthday. That was not the song we had planned for this house, and it was not his birthday. In the middle of the second ""happy birthday to you"" we all start cracking up laughing, and I don't mean giggling or a small laugh. We @CAPS3 all laughing hysterically to the point where we could not breath, and he shut the door.  I know if we would have just stood there it would have made that memory a lot more dreadful, but because we all were laughing, we can look back and laugh at ourselves for it. Laughing is a good way to release inner emotional pressure I realized that night. It's a memory i'm sure we will never forget. I have done something like that on multiple occasions but that was defiantly number one on my list of ""what were you thinking"" moments. I wouldn't change anything about it."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20762	8	" Laughter is always the key to complete happiness, all you really have to do is laugh to be happy. I remember back in the @NUM1 grade, i was the new student and i sure can tell you that i didn't know where anything really was, it was a new school: new bus, new everything. Being the new student is something no one wants to be, you get made fun of alot and sometimes you just dont fit in. Well thats my story, i never fit in.  One day i was walking up the stairs to my class, and it was a bright sunny day, i dont believe there really was any clouds that day. Anyways, as i was walking up the stairs i tripped and fell backwards and my skirt i was wearing flipped up over my head, and of course in that era of time you had to have character underpants. Well i remember everyone pointing and laughing at me A. because i had just fell down, and @CAPS1. because i was wearing dora underpants. Therefore, i went the whole day with everyone laughing at me, but to tell you the truth, i laughed right along with them. I honestly thought it was pretty funny, falling down and your underpants show? who doesn't think that's funny? After the fact this girl named @CAPS2 came up to me and told me im not the only one who wears character underpants.We both laughed as hard as we could that whole day, just remembering the fact that me of all people, I fell down the stairs! Next, being the new kid that could actually be taking embarssing, but for me I have done it a million times, so it really didn't bug me as much as people thought it would. @CAPS2 and I, became such great friends, we laughed all the time. Like when we went to the park and she fell in the ice cold water, or back to the time where i fell down the stairs. Up to this day we still talk about that, its just something you really don't get over. Not to mentioned it was pretty funny when my charcter underpants showed.  In conclusion, i think when the quote says ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" really is true, you have to have a good laugh before you can go on with your day, its just a known fact. If you dont laugh throughout your day then something is really wrong with you. Just because your getting older doesn't mean you have to throw away your laugh. Laughing is the part of the day where you can do whatever you want. So you tell me what is your funny story?"	15	17		32				3	3	4	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	3

Laughing can have many different meanings. When I think of laughter, I think of smiles,happiness, and memories. Although, there is one memory of laughter that does not prove that to be true. ""@CAPS2, I really don't wanna be here. I don't know that I can stay here and tell him this,"" I pleaded to @CAPS11 mother to @CAPS6 me go back home. ""@CAPS3 need to do this honey. @CAPS8's for the best."" @CAPS4 that point I had always though @CAPS11 mother knew best. Now, I wasn't so sure. I sat patiently, trying to hold back tears, waiting for @CAPS11 father to get back to his house. I knew he was at the bar, and silently thanked him that I had time to think.  I was supposed to go tell him how I felt about him always drinking alcohol. Every time I went over there I saw him either drunk, or on his way there. The truth is, I was scared. I was scared for his health and scared that I was the reason for his drinking. I was getting older and needed to tell him what I thought and how I felt. While distracted by this realization, he came storming through the door. I looked up at @CAPS11 drunk father and @CAPS11 heart dropped. I burst out in tears while @CAPS11 mother held me in her arms. ""@CAPS5...@CAPS8's alright,"" she soothed. @CAPS11 father looked at me without any recognition and went into the other room. I walked in the room where he was and watched cautiously at him through the open doorway. He wasn't the man @CAPS11 mother had once married anymore. He had became a monster.  I couldn't stand @CAPS8 anymore. I walked into the room where @CAPS11 mother waited with worry in her eyes. ""@CAPS6's go home,"" I said. On the way home I sobbed until @CAPS11 shirt was streaked with tears. The car ride home was silent and the thoughts and sadness hung thick in the air. I could barely sleep that night. The sun shone down on @CAPS11 face as I awoke to a new day. I felt confident and ready to go back and confess to @CAPS11 @CAPS9 how I've felt all along. We drove back to his house and when we pulled into the drive way, nervousness rushed through me. I wobbled up to the door and knocked. ""@CAPS7. Hey."" @CAPS8 made me upset that @CAPS11 father was acting as if nothing was wrong. I walked in, with confidence, and asked him to sit down. I was content with the fact that I had caught him in one of this rare moments of not being drunk.  ""@CAPS9, we really need to talk. I feel as though @CAPS3 are making a huge mistake by drinking. I know @CAPS10 addicted and there are risks with stopping but @CAPS3're also endangering @CAPS10 health!"" I basically screamed at him. I poured out @CAPS11 heart as a whole new wave of tears rushed over me. By the time I was done @CAPS11 father sat there with a blank look pasted on his face. He laughed. ""@CAPS10 mother told @CAPS3 to tell me this stuff. Don't worry about @CAPS8. @CAPS10 @CAPS2 doesn't know what she's talking about."" @CAPS11 jaw dropped as he acted as though this wasn't serious. Anger boiled in me.  ""@CAPS3 don't even know me! @CAPS3 don't even care about me!"" I screamed then stormed out. I went into the living room and looked straight at @CAPS11 mother and somehow she knew exactly that I wanted to leave.  This time the car ride, again, seemed to be filled with silence. Thinking about how laughter is almost always a great thing, I started to cry because, just once, laughing didn't mean happiness. @CAPS8 meant tears."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
20768	8	"                          Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ""@CAPS5, we've got something to tell @CAPS3."" I knew @CAPS9 they were about to tell me. I saw the signs. I knew that @CAPS8 they went into the other room, @CAPS6 wasn't for some quality time together. They were getting a divorce @CAPS11 the time to tell me had come. As each of my parents gathered around me, I knew that they were about to say something I wasn't ready to hear. The words ""We are getting a divorce,"" rang in my head like church bells @CAPS8 a couple is getting married. The happiest sound @CAPS3 could ever hear. But that was the exact opposite of @CAPS9 was going on right now. As I looked up into the face of my mother, I could tell she had been crying. Where the blue, gray mixture used to meet @CAPS11 become one, @CAPS6 had turned red @CAPS11 irritated. @CAPS6 killed me inside to see her crying, @CAPS11 while this was happening my dad just sat on the couch near me with his head buried in his hands. I could tell that he was thinking that he was so in love @CAPS11 that @CAPS6 all just went downhill, leaving him with an intense feeling of resentment @CAPS11 anger towards my mother. The love of his life, was now his enemy.  At seven I couldn't fully wrap my mind around @CAPS9 was happening to our family. I got that one parent would move away, that I wouldn't always get tucked into bed at night by a duo of love, I just didn't understand @CAPS7 this had to happen. My poor little brother. Only four, how could they possibly explain this to him. If I was confused, he had to of been off on another planet. At the thought of my family crumbling before my eyes, I wanted to cry. I wanted to go far, far away from the troubles occurring at home. If a genie had been there to grant my three wishes, I would of used all three of them if I thought there would be a possibility to save my parents relationship.  Crying just seemed so much easier than sitting in the living room listening to my parents say ,""@CAPS6's not your fault, don't blame yourself, this is between your father @CAPS11 I."" @CAPS7 did they think those statements made @CAPS6 better? Because @CAPS6 really didn't help. My parents had fallen out of love with each other, @CAPS11 the hope I had that they would get back together was diminishing faster than the amount of rain forest left in @LOCATION1. Plus, there was still the underlying factor that my home was broken. @CAPS11 more importantly than my home, my heart. @CAPS6 was broken @CAPS11 I didn't think there was enough super glue in the whole world to pull the pieces back together.  Just @CAPS8 @CAPS6 felt like the whole world was going to crash down upon me, my mother said something to me that I @CAPS1 never forget. ""@CAPS8 @CAPS3 feel like crying, laugh. Remember all the good times that we spent together as afamily."" One by one, each memory began to flood back into my mind. @CAPS8 dad jumped into the pile of leaves we had collectively raked. The time @CAPS8 mom @CAPS11 I made sugar cookies in the winter that ended up burnt, but still made the whole house feel warm @CAPS11 familiar. @CAPS11 especially the wedding that brought the two of them together in matrimony. That sacred bond that only ministers can ensue on people. The one that forever changed their lives @CAPS11 mine.  I began to laugh, @CAPS11 then to cry. My parents weren't sure @CAPS9 to think about my sudden change of emotion. They asked ,""@CAPS9's wrong, @CAPS10?"" @CAPS11 I, still thinking that none of these memories would be had again, I then realized something. I realized that even though my family wouldn't be together all the time, that we would still laugh. That @CAPS8 someone slipped on a piece of paper, @CAPS6 would be funny. My tears had stopped spewing out of my eyes like a dam in desperate need of repair, @CAPS11 the realization had finally set in that we would be okay. That with laughter in our lives, @CAPS11 memories in our hearts, we would survive this.  From then on, i solely believed in that one statement spoken to me by my mother. ""@CAPS8 @CAPS3 feel like crying, laugh."" The statement that said to me, @CAPS6's okay to be sad, but that as long as @CAPS3 have laughter in your life, everything @CAPS1 be alright. In my heart, I applauded my mom for handling that situation so well. If @CAPS6 had not been for her, I would of kept on with the water works @CAPS11 never stopped for just a second to think about all the hilarious times we had had together. So, as far as laughter goes, don't forget to just take a moment out of every day to remember each punch line to every corny joke, @CAPS6 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4."	20	25		45				4	4	5	5	4	4	5	5	6	5	5	5						
20774	8	"When I was younger I liked to go fishing a lot. I always went with my two friends @PERSON2 and @PERSON1.We loved to catch @CAPS1, @CAPS2 head, and sometimes @CAPS3. We did a lot of fishing while we were camping. One day when we were fishing for @CAPS2 head and it was not going very well. It was very cold and it was even snowing. We were about to leave when @PERSON1 hooked one on his last cast. He yelled t me that he was going to catch this on so I jumped off the four-wheeler and ran over to him. When I saw the fish I thought it was a @CAPS1. It was by far the biggest @CAPS2 head that we have ever seen.  While he was reeling it in he said that it was very strong and I could see that he was having trouble. After a few minutes he started to get the fish by the shore. We all started to relax and think that the day was going to be good now. Right as @PERSON1 told me to get the net he slipped and fell right in the river and he let go of the pole.At this time I thought we lost a fish and a pole but @PERSON1 was not thinking straight and he jumped in the water after the pole.   Once @PERSON2 and I saw him swimming and struggling we decided to jump in and help him catch his fish. The three of us were swimming as fast as we could in the cold water after a pole and I was almost to it. Right as I got about a foot from the pole the fish started to swim faster. While I was trying to get the pole I was not focused on where I was going and I got caught on a tree so it was up to @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 to get the pole.  The chase for the floating fishing pole had now gone on for over five minutes and all of us were very far down the river. Now @PERSON2 was very close to the pole and @PERSON1 and I were just catching up to him. Suddenly, @PERSON2 yelled that he got the pole so we all swam to the shore to reel in the fish. At this time we were very happy that we went in the ice cold river to after this fish and we could not wait to get home and dry. After a few minutes @PERSON2 was still reeling in the huge fish. He said he did not know how he was going to get it to the shore. Once the fish got very close to the shore @PERSON2 jerked the pole as hard as he could to get it onto the bank but as he pulled the line broke and the fish got away. All of our hard work was not for anything. After that we decided that it was time to just go home and sit by the fire. A lot of people I tell this story think it is funny but personally i don't see anything funny about swimming in the snow to break your fishing line. One good thing is that this was the most memorable day of fishing I had ever had."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20777	8	"                 A @CAPS1 @CAPS2  I once heard ""laughter is the best medicine."" I believe that is true. I could laugh all day long, finding anything @CAPS9 everything funny in @CAPS3 world. Laughter is important to me, without it, life would be boring. Sometimes Laughter is good @CAPS9 comes from the heart. Other times it can be cruel @CAPS9 mean. I like to avoid the cruel @CAPS9 mean laughter, @CAPS9 just stick to the good laughter. When one of my friends is laughing @CAPS9 smiling, it makes me want to know @CAPS10 they're laughing about, so I can laugh too.  Birthdays are fun, laughing usually comes with fun. I remember my twelfth @CAPS2, I decided to have a party at my house. I wanted it to be very special so I invited my closest friends, @CAPS9 my cousins. Family always makes everything special. My cousin @CAPS9 I are pretty close, she was born nine months after me, so we are both the same age for a little while. We always have a good time, both of us acting crazy @CAPS9 always laughing. For my party my mom made rainbow sherbert punch, it was delicious. Everyone had fun, @CAPS9 soon the party was over, but, my cousins were not leaving until the next day so we continued the party. I was in the kitchen getting more punch, my cousin came in @CAPS9 wanted some more too. I poured both of us a glass. ""@CAPS3 is so good!"" my cousin @PERSON1 said. ""I know that's why I had my mom make it"" "" @CAPS4 you wanna hear a joke?"" ""@CAPS5."" @PERSON1 said. ""@CAPS6, @CAPS7 once was a kid named butt itches, he was really sick @CAPS9 one day died, his mom cried to the doctor,""@CAPS8 my poor butt itches!"" ""@CAPS9 @CAPS12, @CAPS4 you wanna know @CAPS10 the doctor said?"" ""@CAPS10?"" @CAPS11 @PERSON1. ""@CAPS12 itch it!"" @PERSON1 had just took a drink of punch when I said @CAPS3. She spit the punch out of her mouth while laughing, it got all over me. Usually when someone spits, or spills something on you, you get mad. I started cracking up laughing, @CAPS9 so did she. ""@CAPS8 my gosh! That's so gross."" ""@NUM1 @CAPS9 I could not stop laughing. The joke was not that funny, it was the punch all over me @CAPS9 the kitchen. We laughed for at least fifteen minutes before even realizing that both our moms were standing in the kitchen. They were just staring at us wondering @CAPS10 in the world had happened.  You would think that getting punch spitted at your face, on your @CAPS2, would make you mad. @CAPS3 is why laughter makes ordinary days special. In my case laughter was the shortest distance between @PERSON1 @CAPS9 I. It would have to be short for her to get that much punch on me. Laughter made @CAPS3 @CAPS2 extra special, because I will never forget my twelfth @CAPS2."	20	20		40				4	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20785	8	" Laughter is the so called ""best medicine"". I do not believe that to be true, however my nephew @MONTH1 have other thoughts. My nephew was ""sick"" for every school day for two weeks. ""@CAPS1 just doesn't like school"", I would tell his grandma. The thought of school being no fun and not liking it changed drastically for my nephew.  We let him think it was going to be another boring school day, but it was party day for them. Every two weeks if they work hard they get a party, lucky for @CAPS2 they have been working diligently. The stubborn side of my nephew was showing it's ugly face that morning as @CAPS1 fought every move we made. When we walked through that narrow door @PERSON1 did something uncharacteristic, to him and five year old's all over the @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 stood as still and silent as a marble statue. It couldn't have been better prepared! Streamers, balloons, food, party hats, and bags, they went all out for the first one of the year. The aroma made my stomach gurgle with desire. Above all they had desserts, cakes, cookies, pie, all of this cooked thirty feet from you. so you walk through that door and you mouth instantly fills with warm saliva. These children played with a ninja like ability, one moment in front of you, you blink, and just as fast as you blinked they disappeared. It took me an hour at least to find @PERSON1 in that small room. As I realized though it's easier to sit down and let them find you. As my butt hit the cold, hard, and nearly unbearable surface @PERSON1 was in front of me. @CAPS1 had this ear to ear grin on his face that scared me, @CAPS1 never had that big of a grin on his face unless @CAPS1 had a plan. @CAPS1 definitely had a plan, in seconds my face was soaked.  @CAPS1 had been concealing a squirt gun behind his back, and had the escape route planned out. With the chairs and the short tables how they sat long legs and weaving through them did not go well together. It was extremely difficult to catch up in the room, but once we hit the hallway and I could extend my legs it was an easy run. His ear to ear grin disappeared once I caught him, but the laughter on both sides did not. @CAPS1 @MONTH1 have got my face but I got his head! My nephew loves school now. It's almost the end of his first year, and they still party hard, but thanks to us no more squirt guns. I think if we would have waited any longer it would have taken some more work to get him to like school. @PERSON1 is a very smart, athletic and good child. @CAPS1 will be just fine in school, plus @CAPS1 is strong so I pity the child who fights him."	22	20		42				5	4	5	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20787	8	" I know you guys listen to the same things over and over again, but I also know that alot of people don't really answer the prompt that you give them. Well I'm sorry because I was not able to answer the prompt either. I cannot remember when the last time I had a really good @CAPS3 within a couple of years, so I will tell you why laughter is special to me instead. What's so special about laughter? For me laughter helps us in many ways. I will talk about how laughter is good for my health, how everyone's laughs are different and even make us @CAPS3 at them. Also why laughter is so special to me.  I have always felt this weird feeling in my head after I laughed. I think it's because endorphins are being produced into my brain. If I @CAPS3 too hard my stomach hurts because laughing also burns calories and works out my abs. I also think it helps all three sides of the health triangle. My social life makes me @CAPS3 with people. Emotionally laughing makes me happy. Also physical is always funny when you work out with a friend.  I think that everybody's @CAPS3 is unique in it's own way. I also know that sometimes it's funny to listen to other people chuckle, snort, or sound like a mouse. Our laughs are another thing that just makes us, us!  Laughing to me is special because of all the people who make me @CAPS3. My friends are family I have chosen for myself. My family makes me @CAPS3 and be happy everyday. It's special to me because those people are special to me. Laughing with my father is nothing compared to me laughing with my mother. Laughing with my friends will never compare to me laughing with my significant other.  My life is all about laughter and it's special to me. It's not like chewing a piece of gum. It's a whole other thing. Nothing is more fun then having a girls night and laughing all night, or even going out dancing and having the most romantic night of your life. Laughter is a matter of life.                         So @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20791	8	" Laughter @MONTH1 be the best part of life. It usually expresses the feeling of happiness and joy. The expression almost seems contagious in a way, one laugh that goes hand in hand with a smile could improve someones day drastically. Possibly the best part about laughter is that it is not hard to come by, there are many things in our world that are worthy of laughter. I have personally find myself laughing most when I am around people that I enjoy being with. Some people think the key to happiness @MONTH1 be love or joy, or possibly being happy with yourself. I think the key is surrounding yourself with the ones you love and care for because everything seems better when they are around. They are comparable to sunshine, everything is better in its presence.  My favorite memory that involved excessive laughter took place on a warm @DATE1 day at my friend's house just outside of city limits. It must have been around @NUM1 in the @TIME1. The @DATE1 air was warm, but not overwhelmingly hot. It seemed like the perfect afternoon. My friends and I were hanging out, playing catch with a football, building a fire, and being happy. We had all the components needed to have the best night of our lives. The most vivid memory I have is when we were playing catch, I threw a deep pass to my friend and as he he was running under the ball, he ran straight into a fence. He got up laughing, and the laughter spread. That, you could say, set the tone for the rest of the night. The rest of the @TIME1 seemed like it could have been straight out of a movie. Everything was going right and we were all feeling good. It was the quintessence of happiness. Laughter was everywhere and smiles stretched across the faces of all of us. It had to me my best memory of laughter."	20	18		38				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	4						
20792	8	"  Laughter is the esscense of life. Without laughter my life would be meaningless, and without that sense of happiness or compassion, life wouldnt be worth living. My sister is the only person i trust with my secrets. She is the only one who makes me happy when i feel down. My sister and I, laugh with eachother at our own jokes. My sister is my other half and we share everything. She makes me laugh and is always there when i need her. I'll always be there for her also. Laughter is an important part of life. @CAPS2, my sister and I laugh and play. One day I came off the bus from school, all i could do was cry. As I waited for my sister's bus to arrive, the tears fell down like a river flowing. The bus appeared and a sense of joy appeared with it. @CAPS1, it wasnt the bus that brought my joy. It was my sister, right away she could feel my pain and noticed my tears. I could see in her face, the love and care. She asked me whats wrong. I could hear the worry in her voice. My river of tears stopped and I began to speak. I could tell her everything, without trying or holding anything back. The words flowed through my mouth. @CAPS1 need to think of what to say. I told her what happened without a pause. Afterwards, she told me something I'll never forget. She said,""@CAPS1 matter whatever happens, I'll always love you."" @CAPS2 we laughed. It was the sweetest laugh. A chorus of laughter filled the air. Nothing that people say about me is true, so I learned to laugh at it."	15	16		31				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	3						
20793	8	" The night was dark and cloudy giving my surroundings a gloomy figure. Shadows slithered across the street by the lamp light of passing cars and pedestrians. My day had been depressing and it seemed that karma was out to get me. Everything that could go wrong; did go wrong. And the rest of my night was only going to get worse. Earlier that day I had upset my girlfriend with a statement that should not have been stated. Resulting in her calling me as soon as I sat down on my bed. The words we exchanged left smoldering wreckage in our wake. Our conversation ended in fury and the disconnection of phones. Once I laid back down in my bed, and my anger diminished, I began to feel an overwhelming sense of guilt.  I said things that were unnecessary and horrible. As I laid on my bed, my heart felt like it was slowing being squeezed by some unseen force. It labored my breathing and soon tears began to fall from my eyes. The guilt and agony crept through my soul like a burglar creeping through a dark house, and stealing whatever valuables I had left. My day had ended in tears and pain. But then my phone rang once more. Quickly I wiped the tears from my face and proceeded to read the caller I.D. I turned out to be my best friend, and so I answered not knowing what @CAPS1 wanted. @CAPS1 asked if I wanted to hang out and possibly catch a bite to eat. His words lifted my spirit even if it was only half an inch. When @CAPS1 pulled into my driveway, I was there waiting for him. I climbed into the passenger's seat and immediately @CAPS1 knew something was wrong. @CAPS1 asked me if something had happened and I replied with a one worded answer, ""@PERSON1.""  @CAPS1 knew that it was not the right time to talk about it, and so we drove to the nearest restaurant and found our seats. We both ordered coffee and I began to rip open sugar packets vigorously and dump them into my steaming cup of coffee. @CAPS1 did the same but with much less force. Then @CAPS1 cautiously asked me if I wanted to talk about it. I looked up from the mess surrounding my coffee cup and slowly nodded my head. I started to spill out all the events of my day in rapid succession. Bringing a storm of swearing and profane language. My best friend just sat there and listened until my voice grew softer and my fists unclenched. We sat there in silence for a short time while @CAPS1 chose his words carefully. Then @CAPS1 decided to change the subject for the time being because @CAPS1 saw that I was still squeezing my car keys. @CAPS1 asked how things were with my mother and another storm of curses poured from my mouth. We became silent again and then @CAPS1 asked me, ""@CAPS2 you feel better now that you got it all out?"" I looked at him puzzled because it was not the reply I expected. After thinking about it I replied yes. We then enjoyed our dinner, payed, and left. My mood had been lifted, but I was still upset. So we drove down to the river and exited his claustrophobic car. @CAPS1 and I walked down to the bank and stood there just staring at the water. @CAPS1 then asked if I wanted to hear a joke, and after a pause I said yes. The joke @CAPS1 told me probably should not be repeated but it made me laugh so hard I had trouble breathing. His timing was impeccable and it made my mood soar. I have always turned to my friends when I felt down. And there have always been there proving I can count on them.  That day had been a disaster, but the rest of the night turned out to be far better then I had hoped. It is not only the fact that my friends can lift my mood, but it is also important that they make me laugh. Because if your counting on someone to brighten your day, what better way to @CAPS2 it ten make them laugh. Laughter has always held important meaning in my life. I laugh every day. Mostly because I find the most idiotic things hilarious. I know that laughter will never disappear. I hope that one day when I am old and decrepit, all my wrinkles will be from the countless times I enjoyed a few good laughs with my friends. Because laughter is magical. It can make a sad man glad, make sunshine on a cloudy day, and make light of the darkest situations."	20	22		42				4	4	5	5	4	4	5	4	5	5	5	4						
20797	8	" Someone once said,""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS1, to me that means, that since everyone laughs, laughter is the quickest or easiest way to connect with another person. I believe this because at one point in time my older brother and I did not get along very well. We were almost never around each other, and when we were,we would either be fighting or ignoring one another. It wasn't much of a problem since he is five years older; but once I became older my brother and I began to see one another more often. So we then decided to sit down one day and talk. We weren't exactly sure what to say; so for the first ten minutes we just sat there in silence. Just two guys on the back porch in the middle of the @TIME1. Then out of no were he fell over backwards into a bush. We both laughed harder than we have ever laughed in our lives. So @CAPS1, when my family get together, there isn't a lot of arguing or fighting and we all sit and tell stories and laugh.For my family and friends, laughter is one of the most important components of a relationship because, with laughter comes happiness, and with happiness comes love; and love is the most important component of life. So I say, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between all people."""	15	18		33				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4						
20800	8	" This true story might sound some what cheesy, but its true and in my opinion its a love story. I will be substituting the real names with others names though. On @DATE1, after a long day at school @PERSON1 decided to log on @CAPS1-book to chat with some new friends she had made online. @PERSON1 had forgotten that she had sent a friend's request to @PERSON2. @CAPS6 @PERSON2 had accepted @PERSON1's request that's when @PERSON1 remembered about the request. @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 stared to know more and more about each other minute after minute, @CAPS9 before the had no clue who the other one was. @PERSON2 gave @PERSON1 his number after along chat, @CAPS12 she could call or text him to keep in contact while being off of @CAPS1-book. @PERSON2 was starting to like @PERSON1 and @CAPS12 was @PERSON1. @PERSON1 now knew that @PERSON2 is a high school student, a sophomore to be exact. That he is @NUM1 and also have friends in common. @PERSON1 @CAPS4 liked talking to @PERSON2 a lot. @CAPS12 did @PERSON2 to @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 noticed that @PERSON2 loved to laugh a lot. I mean ""a lot"", @PERSON1 @CAPS4 liked that because it always made her day. @PERSON2 knew @PERSON1 had recently broken up with her boyfriend. Any how, @PERSON2 didn't mind, he @CAPS4 liked @PERSON1. He had a @CAPS4 big hope that he could have a chance at making @PERSON1 happy. @CAPS12... he @CAPS5 @PERSON1 if she accepted to be his girlfriend. Without a doubt she said... ""@CAPS3 I would very much like to be your girlfriend"".  ""@CAPS4 you would?"" @CAPS5 @PERSON2.  ""@CAPS3 why wouldn't I? replied @PERSON1. ""@CAPS6 I thought that you wouldn't @CAPS9 you recently got out of a relationship"" @PERSON2 answered. Days had past they were doing perfectly until... @PERSON1 starting to receive texts from her ex-boyfriend. This started to affect @PERSON1's relationship with @PERSON2.But the bad thing was that @PERSON1 was still in love with @PERSON3. @PERSON2 knew that for one. But that didn't stop @PERSON2 from fighting to get @LOCATION1's @CAPS7. @PERSON1 is the type of girl that doesn't like hiding anything from her boyfriend. @CAPS12 one night while @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 were talking on the phone, @PERSON2 decided to ask @PERSON1 if she was willing to try to forget her ex. @PERSON1 was scared to answer the question but she had to be honest and said... ""@CAPS8 @PERSON2 I'll try but I'm not promising anything.""@CAPS9 @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 have a @CAPS4 good communication when laughing is involved, @PERSON1 changed the subject and @CAPS5 @PERSON2 if he was willing on doing her a favor. Of course @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS3"". The favor that @PERSON1 had @CAPS5 @PERSON2 for was if he could laugh for her. ""@CAPS11!"" @PERSON2 laughed. ""@CAPS12 can you do me that favor? @PERSON1 @CAPS5. ""@CAPS3, @CAPS11! @PERSON2 laughed again. Who would of thought that laughter in a relationship could make it @CAPS12 much better. @CAPS3 it wouldn't make it perfect or exactly how you want it to be but it's sure much better than fighting @NUM2 for things that are just plain dumb and pointless. I believe that laughter plays a excellent part in any kind of relationship. It's as if laughter is a language we can all understand to communicate with one an other. @CAPS6 I hope you liked my true story about how laughter plays an important part in all relationships.

Because it laughing creates great memories, it gets rid of sadness, it gives you energy, and it even gives you a good abdominal work depending on how hard you laugh and for how long. There is nothing better than a good funny movie that makes you laugh so hard you cry, your jaw hurts, and your stomach is even sore the next day. Some of my favorite movies are funny.  I bet laughing or making someone else laugh could get you hired at a job. Say you go in for an interview for a job that involves you working with people everyday. Are you going to go in there boring and moditone? No, your going to go in there make the person who is interviewing you laugh and act like you have known him or her since @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  Laughter can also be abused. It can be used in bad ways, such as making fun of people because it @MONTH1 be funny. Calling kids in your gym class names because they cant throw a baseball as far as you. Laughing @MONTH1 make people feel as bright as the stars at night, or it @MONTH1 make people feel as bad as a basketball player missing the buzzer beater to win the championship game. Be careful when you use it, treat it like a loaded gun, because if you use it wrong it could hurt someone.  A few hours after my @CAPS4 died. My family and I began to talk about all the good memories we spent with her when she was with us. I had noticed that tears were rolling down the sides of my @CAPS5 @PERSON1's cheeks. We then suddenly began to talk about all the times she would get mad mad and swear at my dad when he was a little boy, then get embarrassed because she knew she never should have said the lords name in vain. After thinking back on those moments we began to laugh, and not just a small unnoticeable giggle, i mean we were laughing out loud. It then got rid of that aching sadness that had been in the room all night. I will never forget how laughter that very night would become such an emotional memories later in life."	20	17		37				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3						
20804	8	"Laughter is important in my life for many reasons. With out laughter my life wouldn't be as wonderful as it is right now. I have many people in my life that make laughter the best way to brighten up my day, like my friends, family, and boyfriend. I have many stories in which laughter was a part of my life, but I'm going to tell you a story about how my boyfriend used laughter to make me feel better and not think about my stomach ache.    It all happened on a @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 I was heading home from my boyfriends house. We were sitting on the max and my stomach started to hurt. I told my boyfriend about it and he told me that it's probably because I haven't ate anything. I was worried because it was going to be a long trip home. On our trip to my house my boyfriend was trying to distract me so I wouldn't worrying so much about my stomach ache. He started talking to me and telling me how my day was at school and I told him that my day was okay, not bad.     We started talking for awhile, up until my boyfriend took off his hat and said ''from flat to volume!'' @CAPS1 my boyfriend took off his hat and said that I bursted out laughing! I was laughing so hard that instead of my stomach hurting because I didn't eat all day, it was hurting because of how hard and how much I was laughing. I was laughing so hard because my boyfriends hair was all messed up. His hair looked so funny! As I was trying not to laugh I asked my boyfriend why his hair was like that? He started telling me that @CAPS1 he was taking a shower he had grabbed a shampoo bottle that said from flat to volume and he didn't know that his hair was going to have so much volume.The whole way home I couldn't stop laughing about my boyfriends hair. I thought it was so funny, that I had forgotten about my stomach ache.     Till this day I still laugh about my boyfriends hair and how it looked that day. We now have an inside joke and every time I remember that day I tell him ''from flat to volume'' and we both just start laughing.Now i know thatlaughter is the best medicine for me @CAPS1 I have a stomach ache. Laughter will always be a part of me and my life no matter what!"	20	20		40				4	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20809	8	"@CAPS1.., that is a sound i love to hear, laughter. Laughter plays a big roll in my life. To me it is the only thing that can keep me going. Sometimes it is even better then ice cream, and that is saying a lot. I have had many different experiences in life that laughter has been a big part of. Like @CAPS6 my brother got sent back to jail. @CAPS6 I was @CAPS5 I had to laugh because it was the only thing that made me feel good inside. Also, @CAPS6 i got dumped like last nights garbage, laughter made me feel as if nothing had ever happened. So @CAPS6 people are not feeling the best or are going through struggles in their life, I truly believe that laughter will make everything feel a little bit better. "@CAPS2!", it hit me like a brick in the head. Hearing that my brother got put back in jail was a hard thing to hear. He had just gotten out from a four month sentence, three months ago. One of the hardest things is thinking of what to say @CAPS6 his three year old son, @PERSON1, asks "@CAPS3's @CAPS4?". The main reason I'm not as scared for my brother as I was is because of my nephew @PERSON1. He can light up any situation with his adorable laugh. So whenever my brother gets thrown back into jail, I know everything will be okay @CAPS6 I see a big smile on @PERSON1's little chubby face. He is my inspiration to smile @CAPS6 I feel like there is absolutely nothing in this word to smile or laugh about. Even @CAPS6 we were both sitting in the emergency room he still just kept on laughing.  Being @CAPS5 is the absolute worst thing in the world to me. I hate not being able to get out of bed and go places. All I usually do is go stuff outside with my friends, but @CAPS6 I'm @CAPS5 I cant do anything. The only things I can really do is take nasty medicine. Recently I was in the hospital with very severe abdominal pains. Then not even two weeks later I was back in the emergency room with strep. I was in a lot of pain for about four weeks all together. one thing I hate more then being @CAPS5, is people feeling bad for me being @CAPS5. So whenever I'm @CAPS5 I always crack jokes and make people laugh no matter how much it hurts me to laugh. Even though the laughing did not feel good physically, it sure made me feel a lot better emotionally. Laughing is like my brand of medicine for @CAPS6 I'm not feeling well. It seems to make me feel better faster then any other over the counter medicine. Especially for breaking up with my first "love". "I just don't want my mistakes to hurt you anymore", that was the last thing he said to me. My first "love" just left me standing alone on a staircase to drown in my own tears. It was my first real break-up. I was having a pretty hard time dealing with it. Then the day after we broke up my friends came and picked me up. They told me that I needed to be cheered up. @CAPS6 we got into town we stopped by the store. My friend @PERSON3 told me to pick out a half gallon of ice-cream, so I got mint chocolate chip. We finally got to @PERSON3's house and he told me that I had to eat the whole half gallon of ice cream to myself. Of course I didn't argue. While I was eating the ice cream him and my friend @PERSON2 put on a little skit of how they were going to be up my ex boyfriend. I was laughing so hard I got a brain freeze. By the time the skit was over I was rolling on the floor laughing. All the laughing made me forget that I was sad in the first place. I felt that just having a good laugh with my friends brought us closer together. While I was with my ex we never hung out because i was always with him. I had a blast that day and I will remember it forever. Laughing is truly the key to living a great life. "@CAPS6 life gives you lemons make lemonade", that is a quote that I chose to listen to and try to follow. To me the quote is just saying to enjoy the little things in life. So whenever I laugh, I am enjoying a little pleasures in life. Laughing is a part of my life no matter how hard life @MONTH1 seem. So even if my brother is in jail, I'm @CAPS5, or i just got dumped; I laugh so that I don't have to worry anymore. Laughter is a main ingredient to everyone's life, don't forget it or life wont turn out the way that anyone would want it.   "	20	20		40				4	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20813	8	" As people have bonded over the years, those bonds have been streanthend by laughter, joy, and trust. All of these are imporntant but they all work together to build these bonds. For normal people to enjoy one another they must have fun and fun begins with laughter. Laughter comes from the brain and if two people think in the same thing as being funny, it brings them together with their similar intrests.  By telling a funny joke or being a person who always ends up with a smile on his or her face, brings people around more easily. Since I was young I've always been a real happy kid and one who is easy to be around. I believe I am like this because my parents have always told me, ""People that are happy are the ones people want to be."" @CAPS1 by being a seemingly happy person it has given me the friends I have. Although I have never really understood what it ment because it could mean many differant things.  When ever I'm with my friends, looking back on it now, we are always laughing or joking about something. We could be laughing about ourselfs, or we could be laughing at a random person on the street. We could be doing absloutley nothing and be laughing at something stupid, but still be having good times. It @MONTH1 be starting an argument that is funny to us. If someone starts saying stupid stuff, then one of us will jump on the chance to make him sound as stupid as possiable. Most of the time we wont get butt hurt about it, but alot of the time we will take it to far. With all the laughter we have shared before it keeps us friends. Stupidity and pain are probly the top two reasons why we laugh. Stupidity would be if some one says something that doesn't make sence or came in at the wrong time. I have never under stood why we laugh at pain, maybe it is because we are glad that it is not us in pain,although sometimes it is, but maybe it is because we know that they will get over it. When someone is hurt badly, and another person is laughing about it alot of the time I will see them get angry because they are being made fun of for their pain. They need to just realize that it is funny for people to get hurt and know that they laugh at it too. Laughter will always bring people to relationships. It show common intreasts and what people can tolerate from others. Laughter is the main component to bringing happiness into peoples life, with out happieness and laughter this world would be supper boring."	18	18		36				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
20819	8	" LaughterI laugh everyday. I feel a lot of different emotions when I am laughing. Some of the emotions are happiness, sadness, and pain. I use laughter to let my emotions be seen. when I laugh I usually feel happy after wards en less I am crying because I am hurt. When I am sad I tend to laugh and smile a lot to hide the pain I am feeling because I don't want people to see me sad all the time and think I am playing the sad card to get attention. But laughing and smiling actually make everything hurt worse instead of making it better. When I am sad i tend to rely on laughter to get me threw my day because if i didn't have laughter i would have people asking what was wrong all day and it would drive me crazy. When I am angry the only way I can laugh is if a friends or family member is trying to make me happy or if I am reminiscing of fun times iv had. It makes me happy when I laugh and brightens my day when I am anger. I also laugh at things people say to me even tho they hurt my feelings when they said it, because I don't want them to know they hurt me. When I am happy all I do is smile and laugh. Laughter brightens my life when its a happy laugh.My friends and I can just sit there and laugh for hours and nothing. My friends and I can be pretty silly at times and all we can do is laugh, have fun and be in a good mood, and that makes me pretty happy. Some things in my life that make me laugh are my nephew my family and friends. All those things I was just talking about come into my mind when I think of laughter. I think that every single person needs some laughter in there life to be happy.  "	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
20823	8	" Laughter is like cooking; it brings people of every kind together, but the wrong food or the wrong time can bring discomfort to you and others around you, such as beans. Laughter is a medicine. Laughter is a universal language; you can speak @CAPS2 ""language"" with a foreign friend, even when you know not an ounce of their native tongue. Laughter differs, ranging in loudness, pattern, softness, and attitude. You laughed weeks into @CAPS2 world and you'll be laughing your way out of it as well. Sometimes in life, it is important to laugh! Laughter is forgiving and a nod to acceptance. It was my freshman year and I had arrived early that morning to keep my friend company who's mom had dropped her off at such an early time, due to transportation conflicts. I wasn't sure why we were even fighting or why we were on @CAPS2 particular subject; I only knew we had gone off on a ""bunny trail"" and @CAPS4 was picking me apart for something I had done weeks ago. Our voices were escalating and despite the fact our disagreement wasn't taking a turn toward the physical, our words were just as devastating, taking jabs below the belt and giving ""black eyes"" of sorts to both teams. @CAPS4 was right and I knew it, but did @CAPS4 really have to carry such an air of self-righteousness? I thought, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS4 hadn't done what @CAPS4 did, I wouldn't have any secrets to spill."" @CAPS2 was also wrong of me, but my attention wasn't focusing on that, but rather on deflecting her fiery words, sure to not let my guard down and start crying or something ridiculous like that.  ""That only happenedone time!""@CAPS4 declared as @CAPS4 tried to defended herself. ""@CAPS3 way, you didn't have to tell the whole world!"" ""I didn't tell the world,"" I objected. ""I only told one person...who told one person, who told another person...and so on.""@CAPS4 raised her eyebrow in a manner as @CAPS1 to say, ""@CAPS5? You @CAPS6 know what I'm talking about."" The air in the room was as stiff as our direction we were taking in our argument, going no where and getting to no point. The feeling was mutual; @CAPS4 was done with me, I was done with her. @CAPS4 leaned back casually against the wall, attempting to appear apathetic, when her ankle succumbed to gravity and the present moisture, grazing the surface and causing her to loose her footing. All the cool @CAPS4 once had was thrown out the window. Her shoe caught the slick surface of the tile, wet from where hundreds of trodden footsteps were left from that morning's downpour. Crashing down, @CAPS4 met the unforgiving, stone floor with a @CAPS7! which left her face dazed and pride altered. I wish that was how the conversation had gone--with her standing not three feet tall and me towering above her. Concealing the slight satisfaction that was lurking behind my dimples, I slowly slid down the wall that stood behind me, coming to eye level with her. I took one look into her eyes, as @CAPS1 they were waving a white flag and then the smug victory left me. I craned my neck backward, smiled at the ceiling and let out a giggle. I'm not sure what @CAPS4 thought about that at first yet slowly but surely, @CAPS4 managed a chuckle. My giggle triggered into a full-out laughter seizure, her catching on and soon leaving us both laying on the floor. There was nothing particularly special about that bleak, speckled tile, but it was that desolate stone we ended up sprawled on, heads huddled on and hands on our bellies, trying to steady our breaths back into normalcy that one early morning. Sure, I apologized and @CAPS4 accepted, but I think her forgiveness went without saying; laughter is not dependent on words. ""@CAPS8,"" @CAPS4 managed with a smile. The laughter my friend and I had shared in that pre-school classroom carried throughout the day.  ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" That very distance brought assurance into the relationship I shared with my friend. No, it didn't solve our problems, but it reminded us of how silly and meaningless our petty arguments amounted to be, definitely something worth laughing at. Sure, her fall from grace triggered the expression of innocent surrender from my part, laughter, but it was the letting go of bitterness and the welcoming of a laugh from both sides that ended it all. So, no, while we were not on the same brave wave, our laughter was above picking sides--we were still speaking the same ""language."""	21	20		41				5	4	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20824	8	"The @CAPS1 of Laughter Laughter, one of the best feelings an individual can achieve. When you're feeling sad, angry, or in an argument, laughing can turn any negative feelings into good ones. Though you @MONTH1 not want to show the turn of emotion, it is very hard not to. Laughter is an important thing to have in abundance throughout your relationships. Laughing is a wonderful feeling. Whether it be a chuckle or a hilarious outburst, it completely changes one's mood. Laughing with someone is even better still. Having laughter-filled relationships is an important element to someone's well being. Sharing a @CAPS3 is a great way to start friendships and keep them thriving. Relationships without laughter soon end. It is almost impossible to be good friends with someone without being able to @CAPS3 together. Laughter is something that needs to be exposed in relationships often. Without it, there is no connection, joy, or excitement. There is no common ground if you're unable to @CAPS3 with someone. People need relationships with humor. Laughter bonds people together at any age. When I was still in diapers, I watched a video titled ""I @CAPS2 to @CAPS3."" I would watch this countless times during the day with my parents and siblings. Now, whenever that video is brought up we have a great time reminiscing about those days. Being able to @CAPS3 together has brought my family relationships to the highest point. Relationships are very important to have; including laughter will only make them stronger. Not only is laughter important, but it is contagious.  Laughter can lighten a tough situation and lift everyone's spirits. It is very hard not to @CAPS3 when someone else is laughing. Everyone has their own @CAPS3 too. Sometimes, it is someone's @CAPS3 that provokes laughter within the group. Making others @CAPS3 is a wonderful feeling as well. Comedians make a career out of making people @CAPS3. There are good feelings that emerge when you can make someone @CAPS3. @PERSON1 is one of my personal favorite comedians. I @CAPS2 his style and the way he sets up his jokes. He knows how to make people @CAPS3. All of one's friendships need someone who can lift the spirits higher. However, the laughter shouldn't come from making fun of someone. It should come from the situation or a circumstance that the group @MONTH1 be facing. That is key to having a good comedian in your circle of friends. The healing powers of laughter are real and they work. There have been studies of how laughter can heal the body. Such things as laughter therapy is a very real treatment for troubled individuals. Norman @CAPS4' book, ""Laughter is the best medicine"" explains the powers of laughter in detail. @CAPS4 watched The @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and laughed himself to wellness. He shows how one needs laughter to be well. Laughter is so very important to a person's health. It raises the spirits and lightens moods. The fact that there is laughter therapy shows that if one doesn't have enough laughter in his life, he @MONTH1 not be as healthy as he could be. If your friendships are lacking humor, seek it. Laughter is one of the most important feelings that one needs to surround themselves with throughout their entire life."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
20831	8	 I remember my freshman year when I was on the soccer team when we played against the bull dogs in @LOCATION1. We were losing in first half and before first half got over one of our goalies got his hand hurt. So they took him out and they put in the other goalie and one of the other team players kicked the ball so hard it hit the goalie in the stomach. So it knocked his wind out and me and the hole soccer team started laughing because it was funny how he was jumping up and down and saying that he was going to pass out and he just got his wind knocked out of him. So then out first goalie that got injure he had to go in because no one wanted to go in as a goalie because they were to scared that they would score on them. After first half we scored @NUM1 goals so we won @NUM1 to @NUM3 . The reason that we where laughing at the goalie was because it was funny how he reacted when they knocked his wind out. Also because he was our friend because if he was then we wouldn't have laugh about it but after the game was over we asked him if he was alright and he said that he was just faking it even though he really wasn't.  The main reason that this was all funny was because one of our goalie got his wind knocked out and he was over reacting when he only got his wind knocked out and how he was saying that he was going to pass out and when he said it he said it with a smile on him like if he was faking it.  	14	15		29				3	2	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
20842	8	" I kept my head low as I walked through the halls of the brand new school I'd been signed up to attend. Students passed me with warm smiles, but I didn't dare meet their gazes, I couldn't. This is what real school is like, I thought to myself. I'd always been home schooled, since before I could remember, and now my parents felt that I should be introduced to a public school, in my last year of middle school @CAPS12 less. My dark, curly brown hair fell into my face as I entered my first class, acting. The room was warm and dimly lit as students began to recite their lines; the sets were colorful and I instantly recognized them as the garden from @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. I suddenly let out a small yelp as my foot caught in the doorstop, sending me tumbling into a chair.  Deep red color flooded to my cheeks as I looked up and realized that every student in the room was staring at me. I let out a troubled sigh and brushed my hair over my face, wishing I was back home, in my favorite chair studying for my mother's vocabulary tests. I glanced up through my hair and a quick smile flashed across my face as I realized I was @CAPS12 longer the center of attention.  ""@CAPS1, you must be @CAPS2, the new student."" @PERSON1 said warmly.  I smiled and nodded my head slowly, ""@CAPS3, that would be me.""  @CAPS4 smiled at me just as I'd smiled at @CAPS13, but @CAPS13 smile seemed sad, ""I'm sorry dear, but all the parts for this play have been taken, but you are more than welcome to help paint the sets next class.""  I nodded and reached into my backpack, pulling out a book and quickly buried my nose into the pages of my favorite romance novel. I was instantly taken to another time and place, and I wished with all my heart that I could truly go there. I was suddenly jerked from my imagination when a small pixie looking girl took a seat beside me.  @CAPS4 didn't say anything for a moment, just looking at me. @CAPS13 hair was a few shades darker than mine, more black than brown but @CAPS4 wore @CAPS14 @CAPS8. @CAPS13 bright blue eyes twinkled with imagination, as did @CAPS13 face. Something about @CAPS13 seemed kind. Maybe @CAPS14 was the way @CAPS13 dimples came out even though @CAPS4 wasn't smiling, or @CAPS14 could have been the way @CAPS4 sat, tall with confidence.  ""@CAPS5, hello?"" I murmured, closing my book, careful to mark the page. ""I didn't mean to interrupt, but you looked all alone, and I thought I'd come over and say hello. My name is @CAPS6, but everyone calls me @CAPS7."" @CAPS4 said with another smile, making @CAPS13 dimples come out even more. I chuckled softly and returned @CAPS13 smile, ""@CAPS8, I'm @CAPS2, nice to meet you.""  ""@CAPS10, don't take this the wrong way, but you aren't from around here, are you?"" @CAPS4 asked hesitantly. My smile fell slightly, ""@CAPS12, I've always been home schooled, I've never actually been to a public school before.""  @CAPS13 smile fell with my own, and i could tell that @CAPS4 knew what I was talking about.  ""@CAPS14's not always a bad thing though, I'm glad that I'm finally getting to go to a public school."" I murmured, the lie coming easily.  @CAPS4 laughed and layed a soft hand on my shoulder, ""@CAPS12 need to lie,""  I knew that half of @CAPS13 words were serious, and the others playful but something deep inside of me shifted. I barely knew this girl but I felt that I could trust @CAPS13, and that we could be friends.  We laughed and joked the rest of the class, and I was almost always caught up in the way that @CAPS4 constantly got flustered while trying to explain things to me. @CAPS4'd try and use @CAPS13 hands, make movements, just to explain, which always took us into a new round of giggles because of how ridiculous we both were acting and I was startled when the bell for lunch rang, had time really passed that fast? @CAPS7 smiled at me, ""@CAPS16 for lunch @CAPS2?"" A smile broke out across my face, maybe I wasn't as alone as I'd thought. With just a few giggles and laughs, an entire friendship was planted in a ground that I'd thought was to stony to hold any life at all. By just opening myself up a little bit, and showing a side of vulnerability and even fear, I'd opened the doorway to an entire future of conversations, to smiles, tears, secrets but above all, hope. This place was @CAPS12 longer a place of torture, exclusion and sadness, but a place where I could go to see my new friend, a friend who eventually became my sister, a woman who I began to trust and understand with all my heart, and I finally came to realize that we weren't as different as I'd once thought. We were one and the same all along."	21	14	40	40				4	4	4	5	5	4	3	3	4	4	2	3	4	4	4	5	4	4
20847	8	" Laughter is very important in my life. I laugh everyday. People wouldn't be the same without laughter, and the world wouldn't be the same. Two days ago, my @CAPS1 class went to the computer lab to type our @CAPS2 writing test. Much of the class was groaning about having to write this essay. I was annoyed because I already had passed the essay, and I didn't want to take it again, but I had to. Once I got to the computer lab, I sat in my chair and logged into my account.  After a few minutes my computer finally loaded, and I could log into @CAPS2. Once I got there I logged in, and my computer froze. I had noticed that some of the other students computers had also frozen. I laughed at them for their computer being frozen, and they laughed at me because mine was frozen. After a few minutes my account finally logged in, and I selected to take the essay. After my computer being frozen for a few minutes, I got an error message, and it logged me out of @CAPS2. This had also happened to @MONTH1 of the other students, and I laughed because of my my classmate's computer was still frozen and the screen was white. I logged back in and it froze for a while.  I tried logging in again, but kept getting different errors. I noticed that many of my other classmates also had gotten these error messages, or their computers were still frozen. After a few attempts, my test finally loaded, and I could begin the test. After debating for a moment, my teacher told the whole class to log off because only a few members had been able to make it to the test. I then logged off, and logged back into @CAPS2. My computer started to log me in, but then it froze and logged me out of @CAPS2. This had also happened to many of the other students taking the test. After trying to log in, the farthest I could reach was waiting for my @CAPS7 to approve me. My @CAPS7 said that he had approved me several time,s but nothing had worked.  After a few minutes of my computer not letting take the test, I logged off of my account, and got back on. At this time, I was laughing because it had worked before, but I wasn't able to get back to my test. By now over half the period had gone by. No one, not even the @CAPS7, knew what was going on, but very few people had started their test. After a few more tries, and nothing being able to work, the class was almost over. My @CAPS7 told us to log off the computers and wait for another day to complete this test. When I walked into the room, I thought it was going to a very boring period. I was wrong, in a good way. The class wasn't boring, and I spent much of it laughing.Although I didn't get my essay done, it was a good class. This was a good experience, and I'm sure I will be able to look back and remember this day for a long time."	15	20		35				3	3	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20851	8	"A true story for me in laughter. My favorite memory in laughter happened two years ago @CAPS4 I meet my friend @CAPS1. I meet her at the @ORGANIZATION1. I was walking out of @ORGANIZATION5's @CAPS4, @CAPS1 was walking in. We bumped right into each other. First, we were both mad at each other and just saying, ""@CAPS3 watch where your going!"" @CAPS4 we both calmed down we went our separate ways. I went to the food court and not even ten minutes behind me she was right there. We both waited in the @ORGANIZATION3 line. @CAPS1 and I just stood by each other for awhile, until I apologized for running into her earlier. She said, ""@CAPS5 its @CAPS6, I should of been watching where I was going other then watching the floor, as I walk."" We laughed for a little while until it was our turn to get some food. After we payed, I asked her if she would like to sit with me because we were both alone at the time. The reason why we were alone was because both of our parents were doing more shopping. We started to talk about where we were from and what schools we go to. @CAPS1 goes to a private @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1 in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION6. I have told her I went to @ORGANIZATION2. We were both in our freshmen year of @ORGANIZATION4 @ORGANIZATION2 and we both loved band. @CAPS1 and I have just noticed that we have meet before once at a band competition. We have bumped into each other before the same way at least a year ago before bumping into each other again. As she was coming out of one of the rooms where her band was warming up. I was just coming across the room to get to the room where my band was warming up in two doors down. I was just walking, just like @CAPS1 was just walking in the @ORGANIZATION1, I was watching the floor as I walked. Also, we both got mad each other as well. We both just laughed for awhile just laughing how we did the same thing, but the other way to each other before. We both have changed a lot and we both knew we would be very good friends. I guess having laughter with someone you can tell if you well be good friends or not. Laughter is a big deal in friendship. I mean whats the point of having a friend @CAPS4 you don't even have laughter once in awhile and have awesome memories with each other. I still hang out with @CAPS1 until this very day and we still can't believe that we meet twice in the same way."	15	17		32				3	3	4	4	3	3	4	3	4	4	4	3						
20856	8	"                                @CAPS4 @CAPS1 Laughter is a powerful tool when you know how to use it. It has the ability to inspire, when in doubt. Lift heavy spirts to new heights, and it can also create great devotion, to a person, thing or cause. So what has laughter done for you and I? Well it has done lots for me, a good example would be my experience in the @ORGANIZATION2.  At @CAPS2 middle @ORGANIZATION3 I had everything going for me. I had good grades, teachers, but most of all a group of friends that I could share many laughs with. When we graduated and went to @ORGANIZATION3 my friends either moved or dispersed into other groups. It was horrible not to have anyone to laugh with, making things pretty tough. Then came the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 program, or @ORGANIZATION1.  Since I wasn't really envoled in the program I didn't have any friends, save vanecek. Then an opportunity it join the @ORGANIZATION4 @ORGANIZATION4 arose, I took it. Every afternoon for one hour we had practice, which in turn created a strong bond between the @ORGANIZATION4 members. Before shooting we would laugh it up and relax, making it a fun enviroment to shoot. The @ORGANIZATION4 quickly earned the nickname, @CAPS4 @CAPS1, due to all the laughter heard outside the range. The @ORGANIZATION2, which my battalion as a part of, hosts five competitions a year. With fourteen schools from across @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION2 competing, I got pretty nervous. Before our first competition we had been with one another long enough to consider one another family. My family, seeing how I was nervous, took me aside the night before the shoot-out. We played cards, talked and cracked jokes, it was the one of the most special times of my life. We shot early the next morning, I wasn't nervous just relaxed. Out of twenty four man teams we took third, not bad for a new famliy. Since then the @ORGANIZATION4 has taken first, four times in a row. Those victories I have to give credit to the simple human emotion of laughter. Laughter in a way has inspired me to devote myself to a family, and has taken me to new heights. I guess my question for you would be, what @CAPS4 @CAPS1 are you part of?"	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20863	8	" ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""  @CAPS1 best friend @PERSON1. Wow! All those great times last @DATE1 and all the ones to come. Some people think were weird but if you knew us you would understand. Sometimes people say, ""I'm going to die laughing."" @CAPS2 i know I am because of @PERSON1, she knows how to always make me laugh. If I had to count how many times we've laughed about or done together i could there isn't enough time or numbers to tell you how many times.  First of all, this friendship started the @DATE1, and now we are in sophomore @DATE1 of high school. We've been friends for one @DATE1 and eleven months and six days. We are the best of best of friends.  So last @DATE1 when we were learning the cheers for football season, all most every-time we got done with a cheer, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 and I would say, ""@CAPS3-in @CAPS4."" That was our saying, and we always did it @DATE1 and after the football or basketball games. We called it our @CAPS3-in @CAPS4 style or for short our slogan. We would be having a blast and laughing for hours.  ""@CAPS5 turn, @CAPS6 turn,"" In @DATE2 we were on our way to state for cheer. On the car ride up to @LOCATION1, every-time we took a corner we would say what corner it was and do a motion with it. Oh @CAPS1 goodness we laughed and we had a blast. After the @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 turns, there was another motion we called the monkey and we would act like monkeys. It was so much fun we laughed. We also laughed so hard that we were crying and we had to go pee so bad, it was almost really bad.That was one of many car rides that was amazing.  On the other hand, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 and I, cheer together, we have sleepovers, @CAPS2 i should say that we do everything together. She is @CAPS1 cheer sister and will always be, also she is @CAPS1 best friend.I would do anything for her. I love @PERSON1 @PERSON1.  In addition, to the we do everything together. When @PERSON1 is over at @CAPS1 house I always have to make sure I make sandwiches and orange juice. Because this one time we stayed up past midnight and we were hungry so i went and made all of that and @PERSON1 loved it so now i have to make sure i have some for her when she comes over. Now we always talk about the becomes of the sandwich habit.b we laugh about it all the time.  Finally, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 and I are going to be together forever, because i don't know what i would do with out @CAPS1 sister. I would not be the person who I am today with out her she and everything to me we laugh even when we want to cry she is everthing to me. You could say we have a perfect freindship of all time. @CAPS1 bestfriend is @CAPS1 sister I love you @PERSON1, thanks for alays having @CAPS1 back.

20865	8	" It was some day in @DATE1, I was on my way to school. My friend @PERSON1 was walking with me because we both lived on the same street. He lived a few houses away from me but we always walked to and from school together. Well on this particular day i decided to wear a pair of sneakers that had absolutely no traction on the bottom of the shoe and there was snow out. I slipped a few times but never fell. We were laughing because I would be right in the middle of saying something and id almost fall over. We got to school and he started telling everyone about it, I joined in. It was pretty funny because even at school I would almost fall over because the floors were wet from the dried snow. I thought about just walking home and changing my shoes but I would have to wait until lunch because I couldn't leave school until then or i would get in trouble. After first period I found a puddle of water and started sliding across it for fun. My friends tried doing it too but their shoes had too much traction on it. The bell rang for second period to start and I headed to my class. It was fun trying to get to class because I slid around everywhere. Once I got into class the teacher told me we where going on a field trip to the ponds. I was about to skip out on it but the teacher was walking right behind me. We boarded the bus and started heading out to the ponds. My teacher called our names out to make sure we were all there. He must have done it about every @NUM1 minutes. It was pretty annoying. The bus driver was playing country music too, I don't really mind country music but that day I didn't really want to listen to it. I went to get my ipod from my pocket and found out it wasn't there. I had left it at my house when I was rushing to get to school.  We finally arrived at the ponds and we unloaded the bus to begin our field trip. Our teacher told us not to go to close to the ponds because if we fell in we would be soaked and the bus driver wouldn't let us back on the bus. I thought he was just talking smack and I asked the bus driver if he was serious. The bus driver told me if we got wet he would have to wait for us to dry off so we didn't get the seats wet. Again I thought it was a bunch of bull. We met up with our tour guide dude and started listening to him tell us about the history of the ponds and what they are used for. While walking around the ponds I started to slide on the ground. I grabbed onto my friend so I wouldn't fall over but he had pretty bad balance and we both fell over. Everyone started laughing as well as myself. My friend didn't think it was too funny at first. But once he got up he started laughing and joked about how I couldn't stand up right. On our way back to the school we talked about what we learned and if we would want to go back and learn more or even volunteer to work at the ponds. I thought it would be pretty fun if I didn't slip around the whole time. We unloaded the bus again and headed into the school. I found out the little puddle i had found earlier hadn't dried up, I got a running start and slid across it. I didn't fall over this time. The bus had brought us back just in time for the last class of the day, which unfortunately for me was @CAPS1. I got to the gym and asked my teacher what we were going to be playing. He told me we were going upstairs on the wrestling mats to play a dodge ball game. Upstairs on the wrestling mats was a small area and we only went up there if we had a small class. I lucked out big time because we have to take our shoes off when we play on the mats.  I got done with @CAPS1 and the bell rang to tell us school was over. I got dressed into my normal clothes and headed home. My friend @PERSON1 was waiting outside for me. We started heading home and I slide around with every step I took. The sun had melted the top layer of snow and turned it into ice. I looked over at @LOCATION1 and laughed. He laughed too. The whole way home I was skating on ice. It was a really fun day. Except right when I got home I fell on the deck because the step was icy."	20	18		38				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	4						
20869	8	"                                        A day with the family  One day my cousin, her husband, my mom, my dad and i had gone out to eat at @ORGANIZATION2 for breakfast. They had all grown up together, and telling stories about the old days made them all want to hangout more often. They always had @CAPS2 much fun together. I grew up with my cousins around a lot of the time. We would always hangout. We started talking about all the crazy times we have had, and it was nice to hear abut the old days. We were just laughing up a storm. All a sudden out of @CAPS1 where my cousin @PERSON1 farts. All of us start busting up laughing. @PERSON1 continues to fart while she is uncontrollably laughing. @CAPS2 many people were looking at us in the restaurant. Here was a group of people all laughing, and one of them cannot stop farting. The laughing got louder as well as the farting. my mother could not take it anymore. She took one of the salt shakers and started pounding it on the table. She wanted to drowned out the sound of @LOCATION1's farts. @PERSON1 was beat red. We were all laughing @CAPS2 hard we started crying. We were almost to the point were we were going to pee ourselves. @PERSON1 could not hold it any longer. She finally stopped farting, but now she had to pee @CAPS2 bad she could not even walk. When she got up to go to the bathroom she had to walked there cross legged, and very slowing. All the way there she was still laughing, and we were also laughing. We had fun watching her have to stop every @CAPS2 often @CAPS2 she would not pee on herself. One time that she had stop it was right on these two guys chairs. She just stood there laughing cross legged over these two guys trying her best not to pee. The guys did not really do anything they just sat there waiting for her to go away. We could tell they were very uncomfortable though. I told my mom ""I would be uncomfortable to if i had some random girl bent over me laughing, and trying not to pee. I'm surprised they did not move. i would have"".  Finally @PERSON1 got to the bathroom. Those two guys had left, and when she came out she was glad to see them gone. When we saw her we could not help but laugh. She laughed with us @CAPS2 we did not feel bad about laughing. People were still looking at us, and @PERSON1 was still blushing. She wanted to go @CAPS2 we left and talked about it the whole way home. They were coming over to our house to play bored games. When we got home my brother joined us in a game of gestures. this game is kinda like sherades. We got into teams. I was on @ORGANIZATION1 and my brothers team. My brother went first. He started melting to the ground. I shout out ""wicked witch of the west""! He frowns at me and says, ""@CAPS1, watch before you shout things out."" @CAPS2 i sat there and watched. He did his whole melting thing again,but when he got to the floor he started rolling and jerking around. I was @CAPS2 confused. My cousins shouts out ""poop""! My brother yells ""@CAPS3, why would anyone want to be poop""! We all start laughing,and he just tells us what he is. He was a waterfall.  It was my turn to go, and i got horse. I did not want to be a horse. I did not even know how to be a horse without making sound. I went up there and started hoping around like and idiot. I felt @CAPS2 dumb. My team mates made me feel even worse because they could not guess what i was for the life of them. The buzzer rang and we lost the game by two points. My brother hates to lose. He got really mad, and ran up the stairs. On his way up there he trips on his face, and falls down the stairs. We all started laughing, and that made my brother even more mad. He went up the stairs again without falling this time, and stayed in his room the rest of the @TIME1.  The rest of us stayed downstairs, and played more games. It was a really fun day. I got to hangout with the family, and get a great laugh. hanging out with the family is something everyone should love. It is one of those things that just make you feel good.

20884	8	" Laughter brings the world together in a way that cannot be put into words. When two people laugh together over the same thing, a special bond is made that is like no other. There is no way to describe the connection and how it can build a relationship. Every person on this @LOCATION2 will hopefully experience the bond that laughter brings. Last @DATE2, I was a member of a select lacrosse team and I didn't know any of the girls there. The team had five practices before the tournament and by the third practice, I still hadn't talked to many girls there. I was too shy to talk to these girls who all seemed to have a friend with them on the team. At the fourth practice, we were all stretching in a circle and I made a comment to one of the girls and she laughed. We began talking and throughout the rest of that practice, we talked and became friends. By making her laugh I had made a friend on the team and was even more excited for the upcoming tournament. The final practice was cut short so that the team could create tie-dye t-shirts to wear at the tournament. I sat down with @PERSON2, the girl I had become friends with at the previous practice, and her friend @PERSON1 came over to sit with us on the concrete. We all began talking and laughing with each other. Our shirts were tied with rubber bands and we were ready to put the dye onto them. We were laughing and making a mess of the multiple colors, having a good time and enjoying the warm night. As we finished our shirts and put the sopping wet clothing into plastic bags, we walked to the parking lot and said our goodbyes. I now had two friends on the team and could not wait to leave for the tournament that @DATE1. On a @DATE1 @TIME1, I woke up at @NUM1 am to meet the team at a park in @LOCATION1, OR. We were all meeting there to load our things into the three large white vans and to drive up as a team. I crawled into the van wearing my tie-dye t-shirt to see some of the girls looking tired and also sporting the tie-dyed shirts. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were in the back with another girl in between them so I sat in the row ahead of them. Some more girls from the team crammed into the van and we were on our way. During the @NUM2 @NUM3 hour car ride we slept, laughed and told stories. After being stuck in the car together for so long, we all bonded with each other over laughter and story telling. We each came from different cities, schools and backgrounds which made for a very entertaining car ride.  At the tournament, @PERSON1, @PERSON2 and I all stuck together. We walked around the fields, ate meals and laughed together almost the whole time. The only time we were apart was when roomates were assigned and we were not put in a room together. We all worked together as a team towards a common goal, winning games and making it to the championship. All of the girls on that team bonded in some way and even now, most of us are still in contact with each other.  Laughter is what brought @PERSON2 and me together and the rest of the team followed. The entire team bonded over laughter and we all became more comfortable with each other through laughing and having a good time. Putting @NUM4 girls together from entirely different cities could have been a major disaster, but we connected with each other by making other laugh, making it a positive experience for all involved. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people. Connecting with another human through laughter is an experience that everyone should have, it is so unique and powerful that friendships built on laughter can last a lifetime. Laughter makes the world a little better, a little brighter, and united together as one."	20	23		43				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5						
20887	8	"It was a normal day, I had just woken up, because my friend @PERSON2 who had called me wondering if I wanted to hangout.I said yes and I went and took a shower and got ready. Once I was ready I called him back and asked him where he wanted to hangout at. He told me that he wanted me to go over to kyle house and play basketball.When I got there everyone was over there so we decied to have a big game of basketball.I was on the better team and already knew we were going to win, but every single shot I took I missed and it was really embarresing, but my team ended up winning which was no suprise.After the game we all were tired and went inside to play video games. We played @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM1, we took turns and on my turns I did really bad because I dont really play video games so everyone laughed at me including myself.As soon as we were done playing I got a @CAPS1 from a bunch of girls who were going to the movies that night, and wanted to know if everyone and I wanted to go.Everyone decied to go, and we all wanted to see the movie paranormal activity @NUM1, so we were pretty excited and before the movie started we all went over to @PERSON1 house and hungout with all the girls.We all sat in the living room listening to music while most of the girls were up stairs getting ready.I was bored so I went up stairs to hangout with the girls and let me tell you it was a bad idea because the second I walked up there they all wanted me to let them straighten my hair or let them put makeup on me.So I went back down stairs and warned everyone not to go up there.They asked why and when I told them they all laughed and some of them went up there anyway and came back with makeup on I laughed so hard that i fell off the couch.Once I finaly stopped laughing it was time to go and her mom drove us there but there was not enough seats in the car so me and all the girls we cramed into the front seat and the reast of the guys were in the back seat, so I was pretty happy.When we got in the movie theater there was a pretty long line but it was worth it.Suprisingly the moive was acutaly kinda scary it made me jump like five times.When we drove home it was like @NUM3 and @PERSON3 and I walked home from her house and the whole way back he was freaking out and it made me laugh and it made him laugh how I was kinda freaked out too.I think that it was a really fun day because I was laughing through most of it."	15	17		32				3	3	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3						
20894	8	" As we all know, water is what we most need to stay alive cause without it we'd pretty much die. Well, it's also quit similar with laughter. I once heard my night school teacher say, ""@CAPS1 is @PERCENT1 attitude"". I thought about it for r a moment and realized it's quit true. No one can really go throughout the hole day, without having any type of beverage and as much as someone is upset for any apparel reason, will soon end up smiling. Who knows perhaps for the silliest thing whatsoever. I've been going out with my boyfriend @LOCATION1, for about seven months already. We don't get to see each other as much as I'd like to. We try to spend the weekends together as much as we can, but there's been times when it's every other weekend. Since him and I have quit a few things in common like, our relatives, knowing each other before dating, places we go for entertainment, food, likes and dislikes. We rarely dislike of where we'll be spending our time togethe or what we're doing. Even though its been about seven months since we've been dating, it feels like we've known each other way before we became friends. Once when I was over at @LOCATION1's house celebrating @PERSON2's birthday, @ORGANIZATION1's youngest sister. We, all who where there, were celebrating her birthday with pinatas, cake, and all she wanted, witch where toys too. We where all having a good time but the kids weren't so much, it seemed as if they were running out of energy since they were playing in the trampoline for quit a couple of hours. Before the kids could even mention anything about the pinatas, we had already gotten most of what was need to set up the pinatas. As they heard the candy being pored into the pinatas they all rush to get there first before the others, could get to hit the pinata. @PERSON2 go to hit the pinata before all the others, since it was her birthday, then the little kids followed her to hit the pinata. As they went up to hit the pinata we sang songs, it wasn't the best but we all tried. We even made jokes, of pretending to imagine who the pinata was representing. As time passed, it was turn for the older kids to go up and hit the pinata. Most of us were kind of shy, but before I notice a @NUM1 year-old went up to hit the pinata. Right after she hit the pinata quit hard the others said her time was up, they were anctious to get the candy out. After her turm was over she was supose to call out on someone. I thought she would end up calling me since she keept looking towards me. I was already blushing, good thing she didnt. she ended up calling out on my boyfriend. He of course got up and grabed the stick to hit the pinata. Once he got there, the others where said to not hit it so hard or else the little ones whouldn't like him anymore. Since he is one of thoes persons who's love @CAPS3 everyone. He cheard me up to go with him. Without him saying that ii don't think I would of done it. Right there were we where, teaching me how to swing the stick to hit the pinata, I swung it to hard that I ended up hitting him. Before @CAPS2 even say anything, one of his aunts said. That's the way I'd be getting when ever I'd get bothered at him. @CAPS3 starting out slow then hitting him right where it hurt the most. I was even reder then when I was blising, all I thought of saying was that it might be true when ever it happend @CAPS3 then @PERSON1' mom was already getting the cake out, I just left fron where I was at to go help her out. Once we all got settled to sing happy birth-day to @LOCATION2, we where stil laughing of what had happen. Thing is they where stil talking about it. How it might be the same when we get merried. Again I didnt know what to say so I just simle. Everyone was leaving and right before I could call my dad he was already outside the door. All I said was thank you daddy,with a silly smile."	18	18		36				4	4	4	3	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
20904	8	" These are some example that i remember when i had fun and laughter in my life  @CAPS1 all started in the @DATE1 time when i was like @NUM1 years old and my cousins were living with @CAPS3 cause they had just moved down to @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION2. @CAPS1 was fun having them around. @CAPS3 and my cousin @PERSON7 and my cousin @PERSON3 who lived right next to @CAPS3 would always ride bike. Some times joey would take my bike with out asking @CAPS3 and i would get so mad at him.he would take my bike like if @CAPS1 was his. @CAPS3 and my cousins would always race down the street with our bikes.  I was always the one to win the race the kind of bike i has was a @PERSON4 @CAPS1 was a @CAPS2 bike witch is a bike made for the dirt and to race. @CAPS3 and my cousins would go behind some apartment down are street and there was a ramp that we made. @CAPS1 was just dirt but @CAPS1 was hard. One day when @CAPS1 was raining so hard @CAPS3 , @PERSON7 , @PERSON3 and another neighbor of our asked us to come out side to we asked our parents if we could and my parents said @CAPS1 was okay same with @PERSON3. Joeys @CAPS4 said he could not cause @CAPS1 was raining hard outside but he still came outside. we had got all muddy i ad fell of my bike trying to go up the ramp while @CAPS1 was all muddy. then my cousin got like beat up from all the time he fell off the bike.  By the time we were done playing out side we were so muddy and our bikes were filled with dirt. my @CAPS4 was mad at @CAPS3 cause i was so muddy so she send @CAPS3 straight to the shower . @CAPS3 and my cousins had a good time that day after we were all done getting cleaned up we were playing super @PERSON5 bros for super @ORGANIZATION1. If we were not playing the super @ORGANIZATION1, riding bikes or getting wet with water gun and water balloons since @CAPS1 was so hot out side. We were probably on our way to the park for free lunch the school would always serve free lunch to who ever want free lunch. a lot of my friends would go to the park and get lunch same with my cousins after we would finish eating @CAPS3 my cousin @PERSON3 and my friend @PERSON1 would always trade @CAPS5 cards or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 cards back then every body had @CAPS5 or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 cards. i had piles of cards. @CAPS1 was fun being at the park with friend and family just having a fun time eating playing getting wet in park. When i was in @NUM2 grade @CAPS3 @PERSON2 @CAPS14 and @PERSON6 @CAPS15 were like the three amigos we would stay at @ORGANIZATION2 house like almost every weekend. we would always stay at @ORGANIZATION2 house because his back yard was big and we would always play hide-seek and cause @PERSON6 had like a play room with a pin ball machine a basketball hoop and other games. One time on @ORGANIZATION2 birthday @CAPS3 @PERSON2 and @CAPS17 slept over at @ORGANIZATION2 house and we were just playing video games like one of the games we played was grand theft auto @CAPS18 @CAPS19 @CAPS1 was a cool games.  I think that laughter is a big part in friendship cause if your having a good time hanging around with your friend and just laughing then that mean that hes a good person . If your friends always make you laugh then there good friends to be around with. Like i would always hang around with @PERSON6, and @PERSON2 cause they would always know how to make @CAPS3 laugh .So thats why i think laughter is inportant to havewith friends or family.

20916	8	" Laughter is like feeling your alive, that nothing else matters, the pain in your life releasing, and the feeling that everything is alright. You laugh when things are funny and sometimes even laugh when they aren't funny maybe to make someone feel better or just to relax a little. When someone tells you a joke and its hilarious do you just sit and stare at them, or do you fall on the ground laughing? Personally I fall on the ground laughing hysterically. You can have the best of times when your laughing it lightens the mood a little, makes it less tense in the environment. I have enjoyed many times by laughing at the silly things we do or at the dumbest things we do and make them not as bad by laughing about it. My friend and I have been going on adventures since the third grade. We go on walks and get lost, we built forts in the middle of nowhere, we road her quad out to the sandy race tracks, and we climbed over fences to pass the time. Every little adventure we went on came back with a laugh and a huge story to tell are friends and family. After all these adventures and growing up you seem to lose interest but you never forget the good times you have. Let me tell you about a good time I had laughing so hard I even started crying. When your little you think things are a @CAPS1 more challenging @CAPS3 they really are, or things are a @CAPS1 more taller @CAPS3 they really are but that didn't stop me. When @PERSON1 and I were about @NUM1 years old we loved playing outside, climbing the trees, burying old treasures to find when we grew up, and spying on the neighbors. Well on this particular day @PERSON1 and I chose to ""spy"" on the neighbors. We enjoyed doing this cause they had kids, animals, and tons of cars so they were outside A @CAPS1. @PERSON1's dad had about ten tires just laying right next to their fence so usually we would stand on them plus on are toes just to peek over, but this time we felt that would be to obvious we needed to be more sneaky, more like a spike, and more secretive. Eventually @PERSON1's dad left to work and he stays gone for quite some time so we had things to prepare for. We thought of every possible way to look over the fence from drilling a hole to sitting on top of the shed. Finally after time to think about it we had the perfect idea to climb on the trash can and sit down and spy on them. Being brave as I was I volunteered to go first to make sure it would work so that after I was done @ORGANIZATION1 could try. Don't climb on trash cans next to a wooden fence, things don't turn out like you would of expected. As I got on top of the trash can it starts to shake and I was afraid so I held on to the top of the fence but the problem with that is I pushed the trash can further away from me causing it to tip over and me to hold on to the fence leaving me with the worst scraped hands I have ever seen. After the wild adventure we had I needed something to cool down my hands fast cause they were burning. So we had the idea to look in her dads shop van through the first aid kit but well we were in there I noticed a small fan hanging next to the radio so I turned it on and placed my hands in front of it for a good half hour. @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 and I started talking about what had happened I thought about everything and couldn't stop laughing it made me cry because I was laughing so hard. Without laughter @PERSON1 and I wouldn't have the friendship we have today.  Laughing is the main source for friendship I feel. All the adventures @PERSON1 and I share, well they wouldn't be the same without laughing at it afterward. You can look back at things and be like, ""@CAPS2 that really sucked."" Or you can look at things and be like, ""That is hilarious."" @CAPS3 laugh tell you cry. I could see laughter being the shortest distance between two people because it helps make things less awkward, helps you realize your mistakes and joke about them, and it helps you be you without having to pretend your someone else. If friendships were based without laughter I don't know if they would be as good, well at least I know some of them for sure wouldn't be the same."	20	17		37				4	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3

It was a @DATE1 and i came to her to spend the @TIME1.At first we were extreamly bored so we went on a walk to go find something to do.We found our friend dylan at the skatepark and we stopped to talk to him for a while. After we had hung out there for about two hours we headed back up to her house.When we opened the door her sister started freaking out because we left so she got stucked with there younger brother @PERSON1. @CAPS1 didn't yell back, she didn't want the drama. Her sister got even more mad because jesssika was not showing a reaction to what her sister was doing. By ten minutes she exploded and started throwing herself around and freaking out. Me and @CAPS1 looked at each other and stated laughing really reallyhard because how funny her sister looked. @TIME1 after her mom had calmed the sistuation down, @CAPS1 and I made a @CAPS3 bed on her bedroom floor and when we were falling asleep we bothbursted out in laughter it was the funnest @TIME1 i have had in a long time.

20939	8	" Laughter is just one of those things that doesn't go away very easy. The simplest things can make you laugh or smile the point is happiness is going to be around for a while. My dad laughs, my mom laughs I laugh everybody laughs its a good thing to have. If there was nothing on what to be happy on then people would be in fights and country's in wars. Anger is not something someone wants to deal with all the time; you have to relax every now and then.  My parents and I know that happiness is what drives us to good things. That's why we embrace it in our house we like to acknowledge it to my younger siblings. My dad and me have a good relationship as well with my mom we get along well and laugh together.  Me and my girlfriend @LOCATION1; we started out in a good relationship but as time went on it was starting to fade. We weren't communicating as well and that's what was driving us apart. We were just ending up in fights all the time and for no reason fighting just seemed to find us all the time. We talked we hung out and we started getting along better laughing at our joke or our constant teasing to one another. We had a good time she said that she liked us laughing and having a good time. I told her that laughing and enjoying ourselves is what brought us together. Laughing is the key to our happiness its what made me and her closer its a main key point to any relationship.  If there is no happiness then there is no laughter, and if there is no laughter then how are you suppose to get happiness. They work together and its a good thing to have in life where would we be if we didn't have it. We would all have a grudge and for no reason to have one and just live in black and white all the time."	15	16		31				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	3						
20940	8	" A few years back me and my dad were siting at home watching @CAPS1. My little sister and her friend @PERSON1 were running in and out of our apartment. Every time they came inside they repeatedly didn't shut the sliding glass door, finally my sister shut the door but her friend @PERSON1 didn't know, he was running so fast and before he knew it he was going fast first into a sliding glass door!  My dad and I were laughing so hard i almost peed myself. After we finally stopped laughing and went to go check on him and he looked really confused about what just happened. We looked at the door and without a doubt it had a slobber mark going up the door as if his face was slid across it. Meanwhile after more laughs and fun things calmed down and we went back to watching @CAPS1. My dad fell asleep and his cat was laying next to him, my dad kind of woke up and looked around after a few minutes he started watching @CAPS1 again. My older brother walked into the room and saw that the cat was sleeping and took an advantage over it and slammed his hands on the chair. It scared the cat and it jumped about two feet into the air, Once again we started laughing really hard but this time my stomach started hurting. @DATE1 on about @DATE1 my dad my bother and I were working in our garage and found an electrical @ORGANIZATION1 starter. My dad told me to hold the metal ends and so i did. He flipped the switch and next thing i know i was being electrocuted. We all started laughing once again. Next it was my brothers turn but he said he wanted to hold the ends and push the button himself, when he did he couldn't let go because his muscles tensed up and left him @CAPS4-able to free himself from a nine volt shock. My dad and I fell to our knees and were almost in tears cause it was so funny. After a few more rounds of shocking ourselves we came up with the idea to put it on our tongues, i tried it first and my tongue started pulsing like a beating heart. My dad couldn't keep himself together long enough to keep holding the button. As a result to all these great funny times we had our @ORGANIZATION1 starter broke, we gave our cat away , and @PERSON1 moved. In better words funny times @MONTH1 be in the past but there always in your memory to bring a smile to our faces.. "	20	14	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	2	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4

Laughter brings out a sense of @CAPS1 closer to someone, a sense of humor, a friendship, and a positive environment. Personally, I feel as if the world would be a miserable place to be without laughter. I can assure @CAPS17 life would not be the same as it is @CAPS5. Without laughter, @CAPS17 @DATE1 vacation would not have been anything like it was. Over @DATE1 vacation @CAPS17 friends and I made it our mission to embarrass @PERSON1 (@PERSON5). This however, was not as easy as it @MONTH1 sound, seeing as how nothing could ever bring her down. We tried out hardest to embarrass her, but nothing was working. We tried throwing her into a pool while her crush was around, dumping our drinks all over her just as a group of cute boys walked by, calling her names that only a grandmother would call a child. @CAPS14 name it, we did it. @CAPS12 was like a brick of marble, extremely hard to break. One day, @CAPS17 closet friend @PERSON2 came up with the idea of grabbing a pair of shorts, removing the seem on the butt, and gluing it back together in hopes of it ripping when @PERSON5 bent over.  ""@CAPS3 @PERSON5,"" I began, ""@PERSON2 and I found these shorts @TIME1, and thought that @CAPS14 might like them. They're super cute, and would go perfect with your new yellow tank top."" ""@CAPS4! Thanks guys, they fit great!"" @PERSON5 screamed as @CAPS12 filled with excitement. ""@CAPS5 let's go to the mall!"" @CAPS6 about an hour or so of walking around the mall, I threw @CAPS17 phone down and acted as if I hadn't noticed. However, @PERSON5 freaked out and ran @CAPS6 it as it slid down the walk way. Just as @CAPS12 was about to bend over and grab i,t her crush, @PERSON4 walked right behind her. Next thing @CAPS14 know, her shorts were split right down the middle, and her cheeks were bright red. @PERSON2 and I couldn't help but laugh. The look on @CAPS7 face was priceless. I wish I had had @CAPS17 camera.  We had never seen @PERSON5 so mad. @CAPS12 was absolutely fuming, yet @PERSON2 and I were still @CAPS9 @CAPS10 her. I mean, who wouldn't laugh @CAPS10 someones pants splitting in front of a huge crowd of people @CAPS10 the mall?  ""@CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11,"" @CAPS12 screamed. ""@PERSON4 saw @CAPS13, and @CAPS14're @CAPS9? He's never going to talk to @CAPS11 again. I hate @CAPS14 guys!""  ""@CAPS14 don't hate us. That was hysterical and @CAPS14 know it,"" chimed @PERSON2. ""@CAPS15 like we embarrassed @CAPS14 pretty good, huh?"" ""@CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! We broke the rock. We actually broke the rock,"" I giggled as @PERSON2 and I gave each other a high-five. A few minutes later @PERSON5 began to crack up @CAPS9, and apologized for freaking out @CAPS6 realizing that it was all in good fun. Little did we know, @CAPS12 was planning to get us back. By the end of @DATE1 break we had been to nearly every party, but there was still one to @NUM1 and @ORGANIZATION1. We all had a gut @CAPS1 that this was going to be the best one yet.  Everyone was having a blast @CAPS10 @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1's party. The strobe lights were going, there was crazy, loud music, the hot tub was @CAPS10 the perfect temperature, and there was a bunch of people in the pool. Who could complain? Just as the party was about to come to a halt, @PERSON5 decided to undo @CAPS17 bikini top, and pull @CAPS19 bikini bottoms down! Humiliated, both of us ran in @LOCATION2's room, and locked the door. How could @CAPS12 take it this far? Was our practical joke this embarrassing to her? Tired of all the nagging coming from @LOCATION1 and @PERSON3 about us running away, we decided to leave the room and forget what happened. Let's just say that we know what we did to @PERSON5 was wrong, we wont do it again, and we @CAPS5 know not to mess with her to the extent that we had during our mall trip. Honestly, I feel as if this whole experience brought us closer to together. If that didn't ruin our friendship, nothing would. Consequently, @CAPS14 can @CAPS5 see why I feel that laughter is an important part of a friendship and/or relationship. It makes the world go round. Do @CAPS14 have any experiences @CAPS2 laughter brought @CAPS14 and a friend, significant other, or family member closer together?    "	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20949	8	"                                  ""Laughter"" @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 actually believe that only money can buy happiness, but happiness comes from the great things in life, and the greatest thing we have is laughter. Not only does it show kindness, happiness, and freedom, it makes others and yourself feel good. Laughter is one of the best feeling we can have, although it can hurt if its too much. It can teach others a way to express themselves, and forget about the bad in life. Anyone can laugh, and anyone can make others laugh. Without laughter, life would be such a bore. But you never want to push laughter, because even laughter has a limit.  There is different ways to bring laughter in someones life, and there is different ways of being funny. There is good ways of being funny and bad ways. A bad way is being the class clown, it becomes annoying, rude, and it can get you on your teachers bad side. A good way would to tell a joke or maybe sometimes embarrassing yourself can work. It seem to be the worst, but if you laugh at yourself it can make you feel better, and you don't have to look at it as bad as you think it was. I know that I can be funny at times, and sometimes I make myself laugh, but it is never good to laugh at someone and make them feel bad. Making another feel bad can make you look bad, and others @MONTH1 not think of you as funny. You never want to put another down, people have feelings, and hurting someone only makes you look like the bad guy.   @CAPS1 people think that happiness is in fairy tales, also love, but when you really want happiness than turn to your friends and make them laugh. Getting another to laugh feels great, and it helps build up confidence and character. Having confidence and character really helps you in life, it brings more joy, love, and others @MONTH1 think about you in a better way. It can bring people together and it can bring peace. You don't have to try to be funny to make someone laugh, sometimes laughter just appears for no reason at all.    Laughter could be an open way to win another heart. Being a bore can make you seem like your not an interesting person or not really all that fun. When people fall in love they find someone to share their life with. Sharing laughter could help your relationship and make it stronger. All we really need in life is happiness and success, and with happiness and success comes laughter. I can also help you meet new and interesting people, @CAPS2 you more and more friends in your life! With laughter, you really find the good part in life. There is many adventures that life will take you through.  I love to laugh, it makes me feel better when I'm upset. Laughing makes me feel good on the inside and out. I also love to make others laugh. For example, how I met my best friend @CAPS3. She was upset and she felt like nothing in the world was going right, I knew that she wasn't happy and I didn't want her to feel like that. So as a friend I helped her out and made her laugh at all the bad things and forget about them. Ever since then we've been best friends and she has never felt like that again. Laughter really is a great thing to have, it brings happiness to us all. And getting others to laugh makes you more of an interesting person, being an interesting person makes life easier and more stress free.  Sharing this amazing feeling is great and can make your life more stress free. Stress can slow you down, along with sadness. When I'm down, I like to make myself laugh. Sometimes just the little things in life are the greatest things in life. In my opinion, I think that laughter is the greatest feeling you can give someone. Finding something that is just as great, is like finding a meaning in life. No one really knows the meaning of life, and we'll never know, but having the ability to laugh and make others laugh is a part of life, and a privilege. So go out and tell a joke or two, just make someone laugh and feel good."	16	20		36				3	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20966	8	"                              The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 is one of the most important things in life. When im with my family, we all have such a great time together that we laugh all the time at things or memories we say we remember. While we are all gathered around the table whether it is breakfast, lunch, or dinner we always have something fun to say and laugh about all the time. To begin with, during breakfast @DATE2 @TIME1, we were all having a great time eating first thing in the @TIME1, but suddenly when my sister remembers about what had happened the day before at her job, she just had to talk about it because she wanted us to know what happened so we can also laugh with her about it. She had said that there was a banana lying on the floor, when her manager went by she didn't see it and slipped right through the hall. It was impossible not to laugh about it becuase it was the manager. Well that @TIME1 was going by so fast just by thinking about what happened with the banana and the manager that day. Every time I would remember I would start laughing so much that I couldn't stop. It was the funniest thing she had ever told us that happened ever since she starting working. On the other hand, when it was time for lunch, I was at school and my mom called me that same day. I answered fast but not knowing the reason why she was calling. Suddenly she said ""@CAPS3 you will not believe what just happend, your dog just got finished taking a shower and is running around like crazy on top of the beds and coutches trying to get dried off"" I couldn't believe it and I starting laughing so hard that I had to tell my freinds that were next to me and them too starting laughing as well. I could picture in my head how funny that would be if I was there watching her run around like a crazy dog. As the day went by, all I would do is remember how funny that is for a dog to do that, that I would just start laughing all of a sudden during class at school, but even though it was something good to laugh at I had to stop laughing because everyone was just staring. Finally, when it was time for dinner, at the table that night we all told eachother about our day. Everyone had something new to say but, when my brother started to tell us about his day at school, he couldn't even talk because it was so funny what he wanted to say that he was just laughing. He stopped after a while and calmed down but not for long. He told us that during his lunch break he went to the bathroom and when he came out he noticed that all his freinds were laughing and pointing at him. He said he had no idea what was going on but when they told him that when he came out of the bathroom he had a big piece of tiolet paper stuck to his pants. I immediatley thought he would have gotten embarrased but instead he said he thought it was funny as well. My parents, my sister and I started to laugh so hard that we had even forgotten about our dinner sitting in front of us just lying their cold on the table. Laughter is one of the most important things in life. Without laughter each day, it just wouldnt be the same. Being able to laugh during the day is very important because it's like another way to have your day go by and wait for the next. We all at the end said that our day went by so fast, that it was or couldn't be true that the day was over and it was time for bed. The day of @DATE1 third was one of many days that was the best and that we all enojoyed and had fun laughing with eachother telling about funny things that happen to us during our day."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20974	8	" Laughter is an important element in a relationship. It shows the chemistry in a couple, and it shows happiness within family and friends. How depressing would it be if the world had no laughter? It would be like the ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4"". The joyous sound of laughter that bonds relationships allows you to get to know someone better and show them you have a warm heart. Ideally, when a person has a warm heart, your conscience tells you, you can trust them. The talent to laugh is a good element to have when you are meeting someone new, and spending time with your family. Last @DATE1, my youth group and I went on a missions trip to @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1. We would be reaching out to many new children as we held a @ORGANIZATION2 for a week in the small @CAPS5 town. We picked up the children from their houses and drove them to the @ORGANIZATION1 to play games and sing songs. As we met each child one by one, it was important to give them a warm smile and laugh with them. If we had come into their neighborhood with our straight serious faces in our big twelve passenger white vans, it would send out a different message to the children. Instead, we decorated our cars with crayola car paint markers and jumped out of the vans energetically with big bright smiles. We ran up to a house door, rung the doorbell, and asked the parents if their children wanted to come to our @ORGANIZATION2. We had to remember that these kids live in poverty and have gone through a lot. To share the gospel, it was important to show them that we were friendly so they could open up to us and let us tell them about @CAPS6. When we laughed with the children, their eyes would always smile and twinkle. A lot of the children just needed love and we did so by laughing with them and making jokes to one another.  Assuredly, our youth group made a change in the children lives. Our @ORGANIZATION2 is probably one of the biggest highlights of the year for them. In @ORGANIZATION1, the town's appearance is flat like a desert, there's no playgrounds, parks, or places they can go to and have fun. @CAPS8 gave us the power to share the gospel with these children and give them a fun @DATE1 to remember. @CAPS8 opened the hearts of the @CAPS5 children so that they @MONTH1 hear the word of @CAPS8. I honestly don't think we could have reached out to them if we had not been a friendly bunch. It just shows how important it is to laugh with one another, whether it be with strangers or your family. If there is no laughter within your family, something is wrong. It's a sign of broken relationships and a sense of closeness that is lost. In commercials, there's always advertisements where families are around the dinner table, or at a restaurant laughing together. Not everybody has to look like that picture perfect family everyday, but when a family laughs with one another, it shows the unity they have. Usually when people laugh, they do so because they understand the situation and have respect for one another. Of course a family does not have to be related, it could be your youth group, your friends, or anyone you feel close to and comfortable with. Your comfortable person could even be your future spouse. My cousin's story on how he met his wife is like the scene in a chick-flick movie. My cousin, @PERSON1, was working at a ski resort at the rental check-outs waxing skis, when a dark haired brunette comes toward him in her baggy snow pants and says, ""I can go down the biggest hill"" with the most flirtatious eyes and grin. Now, @PERSON1 was very confused as to why this girl would walk up to him and bluntly say that to him. But @PERSON1 was mesmerized with this gorgeous girl and all he could say was, ""@CAPS9"". The girl seemed thoroughly pleased with his answer and asked him when his next shift was. An hour later, @PERSON1 and this girl were having lunch together in the cafeteria. It turns out, this girl's name is ""@PERSON2"". Apparently, @PERSON2's friends spotted @PERSON1 first and told @PERSON2 the guy had a great laugh and he looked like a good person. They urged @PERSON2 to ask him out and get to know him. @PERSON2, being the daring one, agreed. @PERSON1's story proves the point that laughter is important. You don't know @CAPS2 @MONTH1 hear you and how that person could effect your future.  Laughter is an important element in your life. It brings out the joy in people's spirit, gives you opportunities to meet new people, and perhaps change their lives. It reflects @CAPS2 you are and changes the atmosphere around you. After all, we wouldn't want our world to be like ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Laughter"" would we?"	22	22		44				5	5	5	5	4	4	5	5	5	5	4	4						
20983	8	" Laughter is an extremely important aspect for maintaining a relationship with someone or even a group of people. Some greatly beneficial uses of laughter include relieving tension in any intense or high pressure situation as well as connecting with other people in a more meaningful way. The implication of laughter is also a great way to create new friends. It is my opinion that healthy relationships whether they be a friendship or even greater, hardly exist without laughter and cannot flourish without it. I personally use laughter on a daily basis for these reasons among many others and it is a monumental element of my relationship with my father's side of the family. One specific example of how I utilize the essential tool of laughter in my family is to reconnect with members whom i have not seen in a long period of time. Laughter is a tremendous element of my relationship with my father's entire family, and small family meetings as well as full family reunions do not exist without it. Being that they are scattered across @LOCATION2, and very few live in the vicinity of @LOCATION1, visiting with these family members is a rare occasion. The most admirable quality of my father's side of the family is the innate sense of humor that everyone shares. Laughter simply seems to be another form of communication for our family and is the main reason we get along so well. Relationships that I share with individual family members can be observed in every family assembly as well. Just @DATE1 my sister was pregnant with her first child and her baby shower was set to be in @DATE2. This event holds a specific example where laughter was a predominant element of a relationship between myself and one of my family members. Not only was I to be the only guy there, but I was also to be placed at a table with my aunt whom I had not seen for over a year. Although we had always enjoyed eachother's company in the past, I dreaded an awkward reunion and sitting in complete silence for the entirety of the festivities. The day of my sister's baby shower inevitably arrived and to my surprise, I was nervous. I assisted with the set up of the decorations as well as the other amenities and found my seat. Within ten minutes of doing so, my aunt and table partner entered and located her seat which was adjacent to mine. However nervous I had been, the very first thing my aunt did eased any tension that had built up in me and reminded me why I get along so well with my father's family. My aunt greeted me by cracking a joke towards how I was the only guy attending the shower. For the duration of the party, all I heard was jokes coming from my aunt and the laughter shared between the two of us. We reconnected and bonded as both family members as well as good friends and the use of laughter was responsible for it all. Through the use of laughter my aunt and I reconnected with one another and possibly had the most fun out of anyone who attended. Whether we were making jokes about some of the party gifts, or simply enjoying one of the ridiculous games, my aunt and myself were laughing hysterically. on this specific day and many others before and after, laughter was not only an element, but was the sole reason for my friendly relationship with my aunt."	20	23		43				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	4						
20988	8	"  What's Laughter if not a smile, a small chunk of happiness like a chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven, chocolate oozing out of the sides like waterfalls. Laughter can come from a joke, a awkward situation or just about anything. Laughter can be the thing that bonds a friendship. I'm going to tell @CAPS5 a true story surrounding the matter of laughter and how it has been involved in a relationship of my own. It was my first day of high school, I walked in the school looking down at my shoes. I could feel the people around me staring at me but I wasn't sure if I should look back at them and smile or if I should just keep to myself, so I said nothing. I went to the office and I asked them how to find drama class, they give me a map that I had no idea how to read and sent me off. By this time I was scared. A tall @CAPS1 guy with brown shaggy hair and a flannel jacket bumps into me and instead of an ""I'm sorry"" or even a polite ""@CAPS2 me"" he looked at me disgusted and continued down the hallway. It took me some time but I finally found my drama class. The teacher wasn't nice to me, it seemed like she hated everyone. She was kind of rounder and she had short blond hair. Her name was @PERSON1 and she is not in a good mood today. There was a girl sitting next to me and she looked just as scared as I felt. During the first @NUM1 minutes of class we glanced at each other a few times but we said nothing. About half way through the class the girl next to me asked my name, I replied ""@CAPS3"" extremely quietly. As I went to turn away she grabbed my attention by whispering to me, she chuckled ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 see what she's wearing? What are teachers thinking when they get dressed in the morning?"" I started laughing hysterically. The large teacher lurking in front of me said ""@CAPS5 two, hallway, now!"" I didn't know if laughing was an option but as soon as I stepped out of that door a grin crossed my face and I fell on the floor laughing. I couldn't control myself. Don't get me wrong I didn't think us getting into trouble was funny but this bitter teacher was such a disappointment. Drama teachers are supposed to be fun and nice, or so I thought. The next class period I walked through the auditorium doors and found myself a seat close to the back, next to @CAPS6. @PERSON1 was wearing a green top that looked like it had been spattered with baby throw up, a pair of light blue skinny jean that did not flatter her body, and a pair of hot pink @NUM2 inch high heels. Today she was in a great mood, @CAPS5 could tell by the big fat smile on her face. When anyone talked she would burn a whole in there foreheads with her eyes. It was like getting stung by a bee on a hot @DATE1 day. We would all laugh behind her back but that's the way we got through her class alive. After a few minutes of talking she sent us off to @CAPS4 our first scene. The people in my group were @CAPS6, my friend @CAPS8 who I had met in algebra the day before and a girl I didn't know named @ORGANIZATION1'montae. We all got to know each other quite quickly because we all loved the joys of laughing. @ORGANIZATION1'montae was @CAPS9 @CAPS10 as was @CAPS8. @ORGANIZATION1'montae was taller than me by about @NUM3 inches. She had blond in her hair that was only in her bangs. She was stunningly pretty. @CAPS8 was a quiet, @CAPS4 it alone type of person. She was about @NUM4 inches shorter then me and she had short black hair. It was straight, as I would quickly learn it always was. She was stylish, she had on the cutest brown belt and shoes that matched it with skinny jeans and a @CAPS12 jacket. Her whole outfit screamed adorable. We laughed the whole time, making fun of the teacher and telling jokes. We got barely any work done. That was a day I'll never forget. To this day, I'm still good friends with all three of them and often we talk about that day, and how glad we are that we met. So, as @CAPS5 can see laughing is a big part of my relationships. Its a great way to make friends and everyone loves to laugh. Even when @CAPS5 barely know someone @CAPS5 can quickly find out that laughing leads to friendships. It's like being in your favorite place on earth for just a moment. Laughter is a good way to become close to the people around @CAPS5. The next time your with your friends or grouped with strangers tell them a joke. Priceless! "	20	18	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	4	3	4	4	5	5	4	3
20999	8	" Laughter? What is laughter? Well laughter is a contagious disease which is passed around by a group of people from one to the other, ( @CAPS1 speaking) and should be included in every persons life while they are growing up. Here is a true story of how laughter played a key part in my life as a kid. My @CAPS5 has five days of laughter as I call them, that we all celebrate through out the year: birthdays, @LOCATION2, the @DATE1 of @DATE1, @CAPS2 , and @CAPS3. On my birthday the whole @CAPS5 gets together at my grandparents house to celebrate the day I was brought into this world. Usually a couple of days before my birthday my mom grants me the authority to invite some of my friends to come over to go see some event or go to the arcade. Then when we get home we all stay up late playing video games and watching movies.  When @LOCATION2 finally decides to greet us with its colorful eggs and candy, my @CAPS5 meets at my uncles house to hide the eggs for us children to find. Which we always seem to miss at least one every year. While we are finding the eggs our parents are taking them and hiding them again. When we first noticed, it was when my uncle was climbing the willow tree in the back yard and placing the eggs back in the spots where we found them. Then watching him try to climb down again. When that is all over we play a game of hid-n-seek. Which is kinda hard to win when there is fourteen people hiding over a one acre lot. On the @DATE1 every one has their own agenda that they fallow. My dad and me go to @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 to light @CAPS6 on the third of @DATE1 for @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6. While waiting for the show to start we play a game of laser tag which ends up being a big game of around fifty people or so. Then on the @DATE1 my dad does his own show in the back yard for us kids which is really exhilarating to watch.  Then comes my favorite laughing day @CAPS2. My dad sets up his house as a haunted house. Which is fun since we all get painter and shot up with silly string being flung at us from unseen sources. When we go trick or treating I am usually a solider with a @CAPS8 gun unloaded and fully camouflaged, which makes for an interesting night when they cant find me even though I am right beside them. Later when we get back home it is a competition to see who got the most candy, I usually win because I get to stay out later than my siblings do. Well then, now for the holiday that wraps up all other holidays @CAPS3! a time of gift giving and receiving. mostly receiving for me. We all have a dish we cook and end up with part of that dish on me or whoever dares to enter the kitchen when I am cooking. After every one gets done eating we sit down and commence the opening of the presents in order from youngest to oldest. Then it is a free for all for your own presents until the adults but in and make us go in order again. Its funny to watch them when they are chasing my cousin around the house because he took a present from them. So that is my story of what a year of laughter is for me in a nut shell. That is why laughter should be in everyone's life as they are growing up. It relaxes and builds relationships at the same time. Like a saying my grandparents used to say to us kids when we were sad ""A laugh a day will keep the @CAPS10 at @LOCATION1""."	19	18		37				4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3						
21017	8	" Once upon a time on @DATE1, I had my birthday party and my friends come over. My friend tree brought his projector over and hooked his @CAPS1 to it. We played @CAPS2: @CAPS3 on his projector and on my @CAPS4.V. with my @CAPS1. Then we got bored and all of us went out into the living room with the girls and chilled and hung out for a while then we had cake, had an icing fight, and played games laughed so hard. Then we went to the park that was by our apartment. We played @CAPS6 and made jokes and laughed a lot more. Then we went back to my place and we watched @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @NUM1 and laughed at the people who screamed. Then we play spin the bottle/truth or dare and we laughed a lot."	12	15		27				2	2	3	2	2	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21020	8	" The only true story that I can remember that involves laughter was about @NUM1 years ago at the beach. I was with my mom and my sister @LOCATION1. I was running from incoming waves when I decided to run into just one wave which that wave sweep me off my feet and spun me around for what seemed like forever, but wasn't even @NUM2 seconds. I laughed so hard that I tripped and i started spinning again, my mom had to get me up because I could not stop. I got so many cuts from the sand that it was hilarious. after I got changed I got a big chest that my dad could fit inside it. That's the only time I remember laughter being my true friend."	18	15		33				3	3	3	3	4	4	3	3	3	4	3	3						
21026	8	"               Laughter is always the answer. It was freezing and dark outside. The walk home was to long to handle but the laughter that was filling the air made the walk home a little faster and shorter. The cars kept passing and stairing, but all we could do was laugh some more because we knew we were making fools of ourselfs, we didnt care one bit. The weird voices that kept coming out our mouths, the crazy @CAPS1 dance moves and the facial exspressions were the funniest thing to us. Stupid things that people do are the funniest things. Becasue I knew if you laugh more then usual you will build your friendship more and live your life more to the fullest. As @PERSON2 and I were walking back home from @PERSON1 we were dreding the walk home. It seemed like it was going to take two hours because of how long it took to get there when it was really about ten minutes away from my house, not even that. It also felt like we were not making it anywhere because of how slow we were walking and thinking of how long the walk would be. Cars kept passing us but they weren't stairing at us yet. It was silent until something popped up in my brain. I had the best idea so the walk would be faster. I remebered this voice my god brother @CAPS2 that was like @CAPS3 compared to me even though he is younger would always do. It always put a smile on everyone and it was entertaining. This voice I wanted to try it, so I attempted to. We weren't even half way home until I started yelling radom words at cars, it was a dark scary voice and I sounded very controlling.  Then I had the bright idea to sing in this deep creepy voice. That was a bad idea also, @PERSON2 started to dance and cars started to stare at us. @PERSON2 was this tall thin girl that was my bestfriend, she loved piercings and didn't care what others thought of her. I really didnt mind what they thought of us either because people knew we were weird. Watching @PERSON2 dance to my voice was the funniest thing I could ever see. I never thought something could get funnier then that, until she wanted to try the voice. When she tried the voice and it slipped out from her lips I started to bust up laughing and fell to the floor. After about ten minutes we were almost to my house and it felt like our stomachs were going to bust open because of how long and hard we were laughing. While I was thinking to myself i thought""@CAPS4, that seemed like two minutes just to get home.""I knew that if @PERSON2 and I would just think of something to do until we got home then time would go faster. When we walked through the door of my house my mom asked us,""@CAPS5 were you guys dancing while you were waling down the @NUM1 and I just looked at eachother and laughed and told her she doesn't even know how fun it was. Laughter is the only thing that brings two people closer I think. It doesn't matter if you make fools of yourself because you know whats fun. All that matters is that you and are build a relationship together. Doesn't matter if it's just friends trying to get to know eachother more or if it is a boyfriend/girlfriend just having fun and messing around. It's always good to have that laugh here and there and no that you have that connection with the other person and no your friendship is still there. "	17	15		32				4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	3						
21034	8	"                The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 the of day of @DATE1, I was turning @NUM1 years old and me and my best friend were at home, I called him seeing what he has planed for this nice sunny day and he told me he had nothing in mind, so we kept trying to think of something but for @NUM2 hours we had no luck. I called him again and we met up at a grade school and just sat down @CAPS3 a bench and started calling people to see whats up with everyone and no one would answer there phones. It became about @NUM3 pm when we stopped calling people to make planes, so my friend asked me if I wanted to go get something to eat, I told him sure since we had no luck for a whole @DATE2 @TIME1. What sucks was that it was the @DATE2 of the @DATE3, and school was going to begin @CAPS3 @DATE4. So while we were walking to a fast food restaurant, we noticed a flier saying @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 a street that sounded familiar, so my friend asked me if I wanted to go find it and see whats up and whats happening.  We followed the directions to a street that we knew pretty good, till we started hearing music bumping from a distance, so we walked -+ of a mile and saw a good friend of mine and he told me he's going to go pick up lights for a @ORGANIZATION1 and I asked him who's all there and he told me that I need to see for my self. So we walked around the corner of the street we were @CAPS3 and saw the @ORGANIZATION1, we walked up to the door and saw are other friend who was standing at the door, we asked him where is everyone, we been bored all day with nothing to do @CAPS3 my own @CAPS1 and he told me that were here now and that's all that matters, so we walked in and saw everyone we called @DATE5 and more and they screamed @CAPS5 @CAPS1 to me and I was shocked why this @ORGANIZATION1 is for me and how did I get to my own @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 accident. I finally found out that it was planed for me the whole time, I guess that the flier by the restaraunt was put there @CAPS3 purpose and my friend was @CAPS3 this little @CAPS2 to get me to the @ORGANIZATION1 and it was all planed from the beginning of the day for people not to answer my calls or my friends but to get me to go buy some food and to find the flier and get me to go to my own @ORGANIZATION1 and I thanked everyone and especially my friend who got me to go get food to find my own @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 flier and we all had a good laugh, The @CAPS8!"	20	18	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3
21043	8	"                                       @LOCATION2 @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 wants to travel, and while traveling is fun, it is more exciting to go with people you love, but sometimes you go somewhere with people you @MONTH1 not know very well. Every two years or so, the choir at my @ORGANIZATION1 has an opportunity to go on a trip together. During these trips, the students are able to work with college professors, eat tons of junk food, get away from their parents, and just have a great time together. It's a experience that every @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 dreams of. At the beginning of my @CAPS3 year of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, my choir director announced that we would have the opportunity to go to @LOCATION2. I was ecstatic to be going, but I'm an extremely introverted person and I knew that I didn't really have any friends in the choir. I also can't walk, and was scared I would be left behind in a store because I couldn't open the doors or they would go across a street corner that didn't have a @CAPS5 dip down into the street, and thousands of other things that were racing through my mind. I was so terrified that that I would be separated from @PERSON3, my one friend who was in choir, that I almost didn't go. I'm not really sure how, but my mother convinced me that everything would be alright, and I had nothing to fear. Once we arrived in @LOCATION2, we split up into groups to see who wanted to go to explore the @PERSON7 and who wanted to go up @ORGANIZATION2 street, one of the windiest roads in the world. My worst nightmare came true, I was separated from @LOCATION3. I tried to tell myself that nothing would go wrong and that the chaperons wouldn't leave me behind, but in the back of my mind I just kept coming to the same conclusion: I would be alone with a bunch of strangers in a city I knew nothing about. Somehow, I got on the bus that was slowly taking me away from @LOCATION3. One of the other girls, @PERSON4, came to sit by me, and attempted to start a conversation. That was one of the longest bus rides of my life. When we arrived at the bottom of @ORGANIZATION2 street we split yet again, one group was going to walk to the top of the steep hill and the other was going to ride in one of the old trolleys up to the top then walk down where the hill wasn't as steep. I was forced to go on the trolley because the hill was so steep part of the sidewalk contained steps, and since I can't walk, the only alternative was the trolly. Several of the other kids went with us and once again @PERSON4 was in my group. A couple hours later, after getting lost and turning on several wrong streets, we found the trolley station and bought our tickets. Luckily, I managed to avoid conversing with @PERSON4 this whole time, so the ride up the hill was enjoyable. Some of the local people smiled at us because we were so excited to be riding on the trolley. We saw houses, stores, and @LOCATION1 on our ride.  There were six people in our group at the time, two chaperons and four kids. Once we reached the top of the hill, two of the kids, @PERSON6 and @PERSON5, decided they really had to go to the bathroom, so one of the chaperons, @PERSON6, and @PERSON5 raced back down the hill to find a public restroom. This left me, alone, with @PERSON4 and @PERSON1, who was the remaining chaperon. We walked leasiurly down the hill, @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 doing most of the talking. Every so often they would ask me a question and I would answer in as few words as possible, and that's what was going on when we walked past a group of men, arguing, in front of a store and one of them yelled, ""@CAPS4, @CAPS5 @CAPS6! Whatcha doing? You goin' to your @CAPS7's house?"" We didn't really know who he was talking to, or what he was talking about, so we just kept walking, but as we reached the end of the block @PERSON4 and I simultaneously broke into laughter. The man was talking about me. The rest of the way down the hill we started coming up with different weird responses that I should have said to the man, each one being more hilarious than the last one, and as conversations go, we eventually got on different topics, which made me realize that @PERSON4 and I really did have many similar traits. We both loved musicals, we both enjoy reading, and we both have annoying, younger brothers. Ever since that day, @PERSON4 and I have been fairly good friends, all because we took a moment to laughed together."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	4	4						
21053	8	"I live in a life full of laughter, I can not think of a day that I have not laughed. Even when I went threw the hardest days of my life a little @DATE1, there was still someone to make me or a reason to laugh. I think laughing is the best medicine for a person. If you are someone that can go a day without laughing, I'd love to meet you and make that change! There are a few particular times I can remember that we're just full of laughter, most involving family and friends. The first one that I can remember was when my parents showed me a picture of when I was a little girl, there are many laughing episodes when it come to me as a little kid. The picture they showed me was when it was @DATE2 time and I had no shirt, just shorts on. I was sitting on a sled, facing uphill, with the sun just shining. I can not explain how hard my family and I laughed together just from looking at one picture. Another laughing moment I can remember was not when it happened but when I look back now all I can think to myself is, wow. I was about six @DATE1 old at my best friends house who owned eight lamas, who got to get tied up in the yard everyday. The one I always got to walk was named, @CAPS1. @CAPS1 was sweet, @CAPS2 I though, until one @DATE2 day she decided to drag me across a highway. While I was getting drug across a highway that was usually busy, all I could here was people yelling ""let go of her lead!"" @CAPS2 me being six I thought if I let go that the lama would get hit by a car or never come back. I regretted not letting go once an adult got to me because I was all scraped up and blistered from being drug across the pavement. That is a time in my life I will always look back and laugh, but never forget. The last one, my favorite times in life. This would be pretty much anytime I am with my boyfriend. Favorite time was our trip to the beach for the first time. We had never been there together but, it was amazing! We attempted to ride bikes on the sand, failed, and just laughed about it. Then we decided to just walk around all the beach stores and see if we could find something we might have wanted to buy. Later that day we just went to the beach, walked and felt amazing. The funny part of this trip was when we we're trying to take pictures of each other jumping in the air with the ocean behind us. People were looking at us like we were crazy but, we didn't care because we were having fun and laughing almost the whole time! I think that laughing is a very important part of everyday life, to everyone. If you don't laugh at least once in day then something is wrong. I love looking back at pictures from when I was little, having memories with best friends and their animals, as @CAPS2 as taking trips and just being with my boyfriend. Laughing has helped me a lot in life because it brings me up when I am feeling down."	13	20	30	30				2	2	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	3	3
21058	8	" It is often said that laughter can bring people together. I hold that knowledge to be true. We've all laughed at one point in our lives, whether it was in a group of people, or just laughing, and having a @CAPS9 time. Reality is we are all connected to each other in one very simple way, we all have laughed in our lives. Laughter to everyone means something different. To @CAPS15 laughter can mean that I'm happy and full of life and other times it can simply mean that I feel I really don't know @CAPS22 to do. There's one time though that it meant both. It was a cold, and rainy @DATE1 day in @DATE2. I was with my friends watching movies. When I'm with my friends typically that means we're talking about the latest thing, guys, hair, and whatever else. ""@CAPS1 my gosh @PERSON3!"" We heard @PERSON2 scream as @PERSON1 and I walked into my room. ""@CAPS1 boy."" I thought, ""@CAPS3 we @CAPS7 again. I new it would be a mistake to have both of them @CAPS3 at the same time."" @PERSON1 and I exchanged glances, I new she had the same thought going through @CAPS28 head.  ""@CAPS4, @CAPS22 happened this time?"" @PERSON1 sighed as we entered the room only to see the two of them going at each other, violently tugging each others hair, slapping each other, @CAPS29 did everything imaginable to each other before I lost it. I hate seeing my friends @CAPS7 at each other the way @CAPS29 were. ""@CAPS4!"" I finally yell. ""@CAPS3's @CAPS22 we're going to do. You,"" I pointed to @PERSON3, ""@CAPS7 and sit over there."" @PERSON3 walked out of my room and sat down. ""@CAPS4, @CAPS9. @CAPS14 can't you two just relax and enjoy this time and act like you two are friends? For at least another six hours?"" I looked at each of them, @CAPS29 nodded in response. ""@CAPS9, @CAPS14 lets @CAPS7 finish the rest of this movie, or play a nice quiet game."" I sighed, hoping the worst was over. @PERSON3 walked back into my room, and laid on my bed, we continued through the movie peacefully. ""@CAPS10't @CAPS11 @CAPS12 just a comical genius?"" @PERSON2 said starring at the screen. We started laughing at @CAPS28 because @CAPS28 eyes seemed to be stuck on only him. ""@CAPS1 my gosh @PERSON2!"" @PERSON3 said laughing. ""@CAPS14 who's calling who crazy?"" @CAPS15 and @PERSON1 both looked at each other and started nervously chuckling. The tension in the air was almost to thick. @PERSON2 had on @CAPS28 game face for that comment.  I leaned over to @PERSON1 and whispered, ""@CAPS1 this is not going to be pretty."" We started preparing for the worst. ""@CAPS17 grab @PERSON3's arm and drag @CAPS28 if you have to, out of this room."" @PERSON1 jumped to @CAPS28 feet and got @PERSON3 out of the room, with just enough time for @CAPS15 to pin @LOCATION1 to my bed. When @CAPS29 had left and the door was closed I let @CAPS28 up but kept myself between @CAPS28 and the door. ""@CAPS4, @CAPS22 is going on with you two?"" I nervously asked @CAPS28.  @PERSON2 started to laugh a sort of villainous cackle that sent chills running down my spine. I couldn't help but give out a scared sounding chuckle, that only influenced the situation more. This could only mean one thing, my original intent, to not invite one of them, had just been confirmed, we were in for it. I slowly started backing away and headed out of my room to see @CAPS22 @PERSON3 had to say, since I never actually got anything out of @LOCATION1. I inhaled and headed down the hall to them. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS22's going on? You two haven't ever had this big of a fight before."" @CAPS20 started flowing down @CAPS28 cheeks, like a stream flowing steadily down a hill.  ""I...I don't know @CAPS22 h..happened."" @PERSON3 said still weeping. ""I j..just wanted to a..ask @CAPS28 @CAPS22 ha..happened today."" @CAPS21 and @PERSON1's faces just had that looked of, @CAPS22 happened that we missed.  ""@CAPS22 did you mean when you said @CAPS22 happened today?"" I asked. I was at a loss of words when she gave @CAPS15 @CAPS28 response. ""@CAPS23 that's all that happened? You two were going to rip each others hair out over a guy?"" @PERSON3 looked at @CAPS15 and simply said yes. ""@CAPS4 come in @CAPS3."" All three of us walked inside. I sat on the bed next to @LOCATION1, @PERSON1 was in the middle protecting @PERSON3. ""@CAPS4, this is pointless. @CAPS23 you both like the same guy. Big deal get over it! @CAPS29 just make things more complicated anyway."" I looked to both of them, @CAPS20 streaming down both their rosie cheeks. ""@CAPS14 can we just forgive and forget?"" @CAPS27 filled the room. @PERSON3 crawled over, the metal frame of the bed squeaking as she did. ""I'm @CAPS23 sorry, @PERSON2. Can you forgive @CAPS15?"" @CAPS28 face tear stained and red eyed, @PERSON2 was @CAPS17 to reply. ""Of course I forgive you."" @CAPS29 hugged with @CAPS20 still streaming down their faces. All was well again."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21073	8	"                Twins For a @CAPS1  Laughter is a large part of who I am. I am a very happy, outgoing person, and I love to laugh. I especially the laughs that make your stomach feel like its going to fall out of your body and continue laughing on the floor. That's @CAPS23 I surround myself with people that are like me, that's my best friend @PERSON1 and I are like two peas in a pod. People tell us all the time that we look like twins, and when we're together @CAPS24's like a hurricane of loud, crazy laughter. The best part of our friendship is that we are alike I think, and we use @CAPS24 to our advantage. One @CAPS1 @PERSON1 and I were taking a stroll downtown. We were just window shopping,when we past a clothing store that had on display a auburn tank top that had blue swirls coming up from the bottom and up one side, also a pair of dark blue jeans with a rip in the knee. @PERSON1 and I fell in love with the outfit, and as we stood outside the window like ravenous dogs drooling over a piece of freshly cut meat, an idea hit me.When I turned to @PERSON1 and said "" @PERSON2? (her nickname) @CAPS2 if I was you and you were me when we @CAPS14 meet @CAPS3 later?"". She turned to look at me, and her eyes lit up like @CAPS24 was @CAPS4. We ran into the store and bought the outfit. We looked in the mirror and we both knew we could pull this betrayal off. The pants fit our curves, that were identical, like a glove, and the tank top rested on our bodies in the same pattern. The only difference was she was a bit taller than me and my hair was longer than hers, but we deiced that showing a little neck wouldn't be to bad, @CAPS7 we just threw our hair up in buns and called @CAPS24 good. As we left the store, we got asked if we were sisters, and we replied in a simultaneous ""@CAPS5, kinda"" @CAPS24 was reassurance that if we could trick them, then we could trick anyone.  We comfortably walked towards the county library lawn where we were meeting @CAPS3. when we were close to the lawn of the library @PERSON1 turned to me and said ""hide behind this tree, tell I head back, and then sneak around back and freak him out!""@CAPS7 I hid behind the tree while she went up to say hello, he asked where I was and she said ""I do not know actually""while she dug in her bag, ""but I think I dropped something down there, I'll be right back, stay put."" ""@CAPS8"" he replied. All the while I was sneaking around the back of the garden and I hopped down off of an embankment and said ""@CAPS9 I am!"" he was gawking off at a car that was parked a little ways down the road, he jumped a little, and I said ""@CAPS10 did I scare you?"" in an little school girl voice, and he replied ""@CAPS5, of course not! A man does not get scared."" I just rolled my eyes and him and said ""I have something for you, but you have to close your eyes"". He was apprehensive at first but he did as I @NUM1 had managed to sneak up behind him, and when she tapped him on the shoulder he turned, but he gave me a look of bafflement as he did. When they were face to face @PERSON1 shouted ""@CAPS9 @CAPS13 @CAPS14!"" and @CAPS3 nearly jumped to the moon. @PERSON1 and I were laughing @CAPS7 hard we nearly peed our brand new pants. @CAPS3 in confusion whipped his head between @PERSON1 and I, and said ""@CAPS16 this is interesting"" we continued laughing like buffoons, and @CAPS3 even giggled a little. He told us ""@CAPS18't you two ever do this again!"" and I said ""@CAPS19! We basically are sisters @CAPS7 @CAPS23 not play the part?"" he just glared at me in discontent and @PERSON1 rolled her eyes and said ""@CAPS2? Did the man get scared?"". We both cracked up again and @CAPS3 just smiled cause he knew we were playing around. @CAPS24 was just a blast after that, @PERSON1 and I continued to torment the town as twins. We ran around cars and into stores and had a stupendous time being absolute fools. We even got @CAPS3 to laugh hard enough to clutch his stomach. When @CAPS24 was time to @CAPS14, we ventured to the parking lot where @PERSON1's mother was going to pick us up, she did a triple take when she saw us, she just laughed at us when we got in and asked ""@CAPS23 are you two wearing the same @NUM2 and I just looked at each other and busted out laughing, and we replied ""@CAPS24's a long story"". @CAPS24 was the perfect end to an amazing @CAPS1 being my best friend."	20	20		40				4	4	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21090	8	"The @CAPS1 of Laughter @CAPS2 friends and I, always find some way to make each other laugh and have a good time. @CAPS2 friends, @PERSON2, and @ORGANIZATION1, are very similar, yet completely different. Both are active, humorous girls. You could almost say they are sisters from how close their personalities match, but it's their appearance that show's otherwise. @PERSON2 is tall and skinny, with short, black, curly hair. Her clear skin has a tint of olive green. Her looks make her seem as if she has a deep secret. The mystery is hidden behind her baby blue eyes. @CAPS2 other friend, @LOCATION1, has sunshine glowing from her hair. Each golden curl ends at her belly button. The freckles, that lightly cover her fair skin, only appear on her perky cheeks. Her eyes seem like the deep blue ocean. You can only imagine swimming in such an amazing color of blue.  One @DATE1 @TIME1, while the sun was setting on a cold @DATE2 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 girls and I decided to learn the @PERSON1 @CAPS4 dance. After a night of practice, I gave up and laid on the full cushion couch, that comfort every part of @CAPS2 body. Two hours fly by and the girls got it. They both had each leg steps and every movement just like @PERSON1. They were so good that they could have been @PERSON1's back-up dancers. After a moment of accomplishment, we realized how ridiculous the idea was and stopped. @ORGANIZATION1 begged to do the dance once more, but with the camera recording. Minutes after pressuring @PERSON2, I started the music and pressed the record button.  The girls were doing great, but started forgetting some of the steps. Out of nowhere, both girls, full speed, run into each other. It was silent, except for the music playing. Each of us look at each other and start dieing from laughter. @PERSON2, and @ORGANIZATION1, get up, crying from laughing and apologize to each other. All of this happened with me recording. After settling down, we watched the most amazing home video.  Remembering funny moments like this make me realize how thankful I am for @CAPS2 friends. It makes me feel good to know that we can all be ourselves together. Without them I would not know what laughter is."	18	19		37				4	3	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3	4						
21098	8	" Entering into the classroom, I began to shiver from anxiety. I was the new student in the fourth grade, transferring from a public grade school to a @CAPS1 school kept my head swimming with questions, which I put aside as I stepped into the room with a large white ""@NUM1"" on the exterior wall. I swear, I could feel my bones literally shaking because of my nerves. Surprisingly, no one approached me as I came in. I noticed that they were all surrounding this @CAPS4-go-lucky brunette. No one really even took note that I was there until the teacher looked up. After introducing myself to her and the class, I looked back at that brunette who was previously surrounded by the group of my to-be peers. She smiled at me as I stood there, with my feet uncontrollably glued to the ground, looking blankly at her for a few seconds. When someone told me this girl was the other new student in their class, I understood why everyone was staring at her. I soon became green with envy over her because of all the attention she got. I was unintentionally a fairly jealous child, and when I noticed that everyone wanted to be her friend and I got somewhat ignored, I stomach slowly twisted in knots more and more each day as I began to form feelings of suspicion and dislike towards this girl. Even her name sounded suspicious to me. @PERSON1. I had never in my life heard of anyone named @PERSON1 before. Luckily, I sat on the opposite side of the classroom as her. And even as a month passed, I still felt uncomfortable being near her, so I stubbornly avoided her. My birthday soon began to creep up after the first month at @LOCATION1. I was beginning to find out which people I wanted to be friends with, and which people to avoid. Unfortunately, even the people I had gradually grown weary of, had to be invited to my birthday party because it was a class party and I didn't want anyone to be left out and since the class only had thirty people in it, I could only deduce that word about the party would spread around and people would begin to talk. I knew that I hadn't built up enough of a reputation for people to know who I really was or what my personality was actually like. As, I was putting an invitation in everyone's beige, square cubby, I hesitated when I came across ""#@NUM2"". This was her number. The number of that girl with the bizarre name that I had an undeserved, grudge-like suspicion of. I cursed myself violently after I put that birthday party invitation into her cubby. When the day for the party finally rolled around, I had everything set up just how I imagined. I even had the perfect @CAPS2 @CAPS3 cake picked out for myself. The guests began to arrive knocking at the glass door, temporarily staining it little grimy knuckle prints. @PERSON1 came alone. As I opened the door, she timidly and immediately shoved a gift at me and shyly muttered under her breath ""@CAPS4 birthday @CAPS5"". I welcomed her traditionally, as I did with everyone else and showed her to the backyard. The party continued to go in several directions until my mom gathered everyone around, so I could blow out the candles. @PERSON1 stepped up next to me. With a confused expression on my face, my mom leaned down to whisper that @PERSON1 had the same birthday as me and she would blow out the candles with me. I couldn't believe it. The person who I had selfishly pretended to not exist, was the person who I had to share my cake with. After blowing out the candles, everyone left because the party ended and I silently pouted for having to share my birthday with another person. After the party, I walked into the house, only to find @PERSON1 sitting on my steps. Her mom apparently couldn't pick her up for another hour. I came over to her and casually started making small talk with her. A few minutes later, my brother ran in with a huge glob of frosting in his hand. He yelled @CAPS4 birthday to me and threw it at my face. I was shocked and didn't know what to do. He ran downstairs to his room as I continued to stand there with my mouth gaping. Then, I heard someone laughing behind me. I turned around to see @PERSON1 giggling. And without warning I started laughing too. And neither one of us could stop. It was at that moment when I realized I was wrong about her. We spent the rest of the hour playing and laughing, and by the time her mom came, we were begging for a sleepover. Although we were unsuccessful, I had grown to understand that this girl was someone I wanted to get close to. @PERSON1, through that first laugh, became my best friend and continues to be my best and closest friend today."	23	20		43				5	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	5	4	4	4						
21130	8	" I used to love hermit crabs. The cute little creatures who hid in their shells fascinated me. When I was about six my family decided to take a road trip along a @CAPS1 coastline. We were accompanied by another family with four kids. Put together there were @NUM1 kids for me to play with, but the closest one to my age was @PERSON1. He was only a couple years older than me. I adored @PERSON1. We explored, swam, giggled, and played tricks on our siblings together. Everything he did, I did.  We went to so many different beaches I can't remember half of them, but one in particular stood out. It was a short and slender beach. On one side there was a cave. The cave was loaded with hermit crabs. Never in my life have I seen so many of them. There were mini hermit crabs, great big hermit crabs, and even bigger hermit crabs! It was as if our dreams had come true. @PERSON1 and I created sand castles, prisons, and water channels to keep the hermit crabs contained. Our older siblings weren't interested in them at all. That was alright though, in our eyes it only meant more for us!  When it was time to leave, @PERSON1 and I were devastated. We both knew that we wouldn't just come across another beach like this is the future. It finally hit us that we wouldn't be able to keep our beloved crabs. We stayed down on the beach near the cave for hours just saying our ""good byes"". When my mom eventually yelled across the beach saying that it was time to go, we both had made a quick decision. I had watched girls stuff shells into there bathing suits before. I thought why not? @PERSON1 liked the idea, so we silently slid two hermit into our swim trunks. His crab in the pocket of his shorts, mine in my one piece swim suit. It sagged at the bottom, but I decided to ignore it and pretend like nothing was wrong. Guilt weighted down my scrawny little body, like I had stuck a ten pound rock in my suit, not a tiny little crab. My mom had asked me directly if I had left all the hermit crabs on the beach. I nodded, but my voice was absent.  Back on the road my sister and I played word games. Everything was fine, the music playing, my parents talking. and our wheels rolling down the narrow dirt road.Every once in a while I would have to move a little because I could feel my little hermit crab checking out his surroundings. We had been driving for about an hour when I let out a blood curdling scream. As my dad slammed on the brakes dust swirled around the car like a hurricane. I remember my mom swiveling in her seat to look at me and ask what was wrong. I didn't answer. As the pincers grabbed on again, I let out another urgent scream. I then decided it was time to quit hiding my little friend in the bottom of my swimsuit. Letting out the last prolonged scream I pointed down to my crotch. My sister's urgent hands pulled my swimsuit off and quickly found the little devil. I was so embarrassed and guilty that my mom just laughed. She said that I had already gotten my punishment for lying, and that she thought I had learned my lesson. I sure wasn't going to disagree on that. A few minutes later, our friends pulled over too. When we asked if everything was okay, they said while laughing, that one of the girls had gotten pinched by @PERSON1's hermit crab. That sent all of us laughing.  We never stopped laughing about that story. My family loves to humiliate me in front of friends, guys that I like, or adults that I don't even know. Every time my mother says that that crab grabbed right onto ""where it counts"" we all bust out laughing. And every time I turn tomato red in embarrassment, but I guess I deserve it.  @PERSON1 and I both learned our lessons, although I think I learned a few extra lessons. First of all, never put and animal near your ""sensitive"" parts. The second lesson was don't lie, because eventually you will most likely be be caught and punished. The last lesson would have to be to learn how to enjoy something when you have it and when it is time to let it go, let whatever it is let it go, and be grateful for the time you got to enjoy it. If I would have been able to just say good bye to my shelled friends, I would have never lied or felt so much pain. They were all great lessons to learn, and I am very grateful for them. Not only because I became a little wiser, but also because I have a great story to tell that always sends people up in laughter."	25	20		45				5	5	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21133	8	"                       My @CAPS1  @CAPS2 was a warm, @DATE1 @TIME1 in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. The stars were out and there wasn't a cloud to be seen. As usual on the weekends, most of the family was over; as well as some friends. I was just a little girl who loved everyone and everything, especially laughing. Anyone could make me laugh, smile and have a good time. One person, however, could make me laugh for hours straight. That person was my @CAPS1.  My @CAPS1, @PERSON1, came over to hang out with the rest of the family and friends that were at my house. He was talking, laughing, and having a really good time. Of course, I was only about five or six years old at the time; but to me, aside from my dad, my @CAPS1 was the coolest person in the world. That @TIME1, I was playing with my friends and not really paying attention to all of the adults. All of a sudden, my @CAPS1 came up to me, gave me a big hug and started to talk to me. I was so happy. Since I loved to joke around and laugh, I was thrilled to have all the attention. I used to call them laugh attacks. Anytime my @CAPS1 talked to me, I started laughing and I would laugh so hard that I couldn't stop. That @TIME1, I had one of them. My @CAPS1 and I were joking around and making fun of each other. Then, out of nowhere, I realized that I was laughing so hard that my stomach hurt. @CAPS2 went on for about an hour straight. That was long after my @CAPS1 left and went back to the adults. My friend, @LOCATION2, sat next to me and tried to get me to stop laughing. She was laughing too, but not as much as me.  Finally, after a long hour or so, I got myself to calm down. The rest of the @TIME1 was great but every so often, I started to laugh again. There was absolutely no way that I was going to stop giggling until I went to bed. After a long @TIME1 of having a good time, everyone left and went home. When my @CAPS1 came to say goodbye to me, I was upset that he was leaving, but I knew that I would see him again. The next day, I was right about being able to stop laughing. I still smiled and hung out with my family, but I wasn't laughing uncontrollably.    My @CAPS1 was and still is a huge part of my life. He is always the person that can make me laugh and forget about all of my worries. Even though I don't live near him anymore, I can still talk to him on the phone and laugh and joke around with him. When I go visit him down in @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 seems like we just pick things up where they left off. We don't even think about the fact that we haven't seen each other in a really long time.   When my dad passed away, my @CAPS1 was always there for me. He is the one male figure that I still have in my life. After everything that I've gone through, I could always count on him to brighten the mood and make me laugh, or at least smile. People really do need a person like my @CAPS1 in their lives. @CAPS2 really does help to know that you have someone that loves you and can brighten your day. All you have to do is talk to him. My relationship with my @CAPS1 is very close, and the one thing that kept @CAPS2 that way is all of the laughs that we have shared through the years. Laughter is a huge part of anyone's life. I have grown up around laughter and the thought of always being happy. Throughout my life, I have had to deal with pain, loss, and sadness. However, after everything that I have come through, I can always come out laughing. When I was eleven years old, my dad passed away. At an even younger age, my parents got divorced. No matter how much those things hurt me, I never stopped laughing and moving on with my life."	20	15		35				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	3	3						
21134	8	"                             laughter @CAPS1 funny, normally when i fall of line, for some reason @CAPS1 humorous to me. I'm laughing in my head the hole way down down a rapid.I've taken plenty of beat downs whale I have been kayaking, @CAPS2 i think that my day running the upper stretch of the white salmon might have been my worst beat down yet. I like to call that day the @CAPS5 beat down. @CAPS4 was a very nice day and I felt like @CAPS4 would just be a normal day on the upper white salmon, @CAPS2 oh I was wrong. The bad news started as soon as @PERSON3, @PERSON2 and I parked the car. @PERSON3 had brought the wrong size spray skirt for his creek boat. I had no doubt that we could conquer this problem. the spray skirt ended up barely fitting, @CAPS4 took the strength of all three of us to get @CAPS4 on. After a long hike through an empty creek bed we found our selves at the put in. This is a fairly simple put in, you start off with finding a faltish spot on a @NUM1 foot rock slide. after you find your spot, you simply slide down the rock and of a seven foot drop into water. Unfortunately @CAPS4 wasn't that simple for me, I slid down the rock and of the drop perfectly fine @CAPS2 little did I know I didn't put my spray skirt on all the way so when I dropped into the water about a gallon or so rushed into my boat. I didn't think much about @CAPS4 because @CAPS4 was just a gallon. I actually thought @CAPS4 was kinda funny and that put a good feeling in my gut because that day I was paddling a big boat for my size so I thought @CAPS4 would help my weight distribution a little bit. There for I didn't empty out my boat and we just started paddling down stream.  The first few rapids were no big deal I poked through all the holes there were and I felt like I was doing realitavly good because @CAPS4 had been a while scene I had paddled this stretch. We were about half way through our run when I was starting to realize the magnitude of how gnarly this river was, I was rolling in every rapid I possibly could and laughing my face of every time, @CAPS2 I couldn't quit, there was no way out of this canyon, we had at least @DATE1 foot walls on either side of us, the only way out was down stream! We were nearing the end of our trip and we had @CAPS2 only one more big drop still left to conquer. @CAPS5 falls, a @NUM2 foot drop (depends on who you ask) of pure white water. this drop isn't like any ordanry waterfall in fact this drop isn't really anything like a waterfall, sure you definitely will feel the free fall @CAPS2 the water hydrolics are nothing like a waterfall. What happens on this drop is the canyon gets narrow and when all that water goes over a ledg @CAPS4 creates a hole at the bottom. @CAPS4 is also legged out at the bottom so there's tons of water boiling back up stream, so ounce your stuck in that hole @CAPS1 like trying to paddle up hill and there's basically no way to paddle out of this hole. you just have to hope for the best, hold your breath and stay calm. We were neering @CAPS5 falls and there's only @NUM3 eddies you can catch before the falls so you can scout @CAPS4. Funny enough when I was trying to make the second @PERSON1 my boat got bumped out by @PERSON3's boat and that little bump ended up flipping me upside down and spinning me backwards, at this point there wasn't much I could do about the next few minutes of my life. So I plunged over the falls, I was mixed up in a huge whitewater mess for about a minute and a half, only having brief moments where I could possibly catch a breath of air. I toughed through @CAPS4 and didn't pull my spray skirt because i didn't want to drink from the shoe(don't ask) and because of if I ended up ejecting from my boat there's no way to know what would happen to me in this monster. I powered through @CAPS4, what was only a short minute seemed like a lifetime to me. I ended up getting flushed out down stream and rolling up perfectly unharmed. when I rolled up, I had the biggest smile on my face and my heart was racing. I don't think I would have made @CAPS4 if I didn't have a good attitude coming into this day and having the need to laugh in my head when I messed up. All in all laughing saved my life!

21138	8	"                            Closer @CAPS1 @CAPS2  In life, I think that laughter is a very important element. Without it, everything just wouldn't seem as fun. Laughter can be a great thing, or it can be a little hurtful at times. Luckily my story is of great laughter. So, i will be telling a story of one of my adventures of laughter.  It all started one day when me and my cousin @ORGANIZATION1 were at home. It was pretty much a normal day. Mom was out and about town, and dad was at work. @ORGANIZATION1 and I were having a great day because it was a @DATE1. Which meant school only went until eleven o' clock. With mom out and about town, we figured she wouldn't be home until much later. That gave us plenty of time to get everything accomplished.  First thing we usually do when mom's gone is go get our music, and turn it up @CAPS3 loud. Since it was just the two of us home, we didn't care how loud it was. That particular @DATE1 was a surprise to us though. For it was strange enough to seem as a ""natural high"" day. We felt very positive with high energy. We were practically ready for everything.  With the music so loud while we were cleaning the kitchen, we could barely understand each other talking. Then @CAPS5 awhile when the music stopped, it was just silent rushed cleaning in the kitchen. @ORGANIZATION1 and I tend to think a lot alike. It is so weird. Sometimes I feel like she's just my sister instead of my cousin. Anyway, out of no where, and complete silence, we started to sing. I don't think we realized we were singing the same exact song, at the same exact time.  Once we realized that we were doing the same exact thing, it sort of creeped us out! We thought to ourselves... ""@CAPS4, how can two people ever be so much alike?!"" @CAPS5 that happened, we went on finishing our work. '@CAPS6 this day, all the time, we do a lot of the same things. We are very @CAPS2, much like sisters. I'm going to miss her so much when she leaves!"	18	15		33				3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	3	3	3						
21141	8	"Laughter, an important part of life, just the feeling of laughing is comforting because at that time everything is okay.Laughing brings people together and makes them laugh together, its like a way of communication. Once you laugh about something other people start laughing and it connects everybody together to be happy. Its like telling everybody to be happy but without even talking to them.That's when people laugh with you, but when they laugh at you, well that's a different story.I remember one day when I was home washing the dishes and everyone in my family was frustrated, even me.I hate being mad and I hate it when people get mad, so I said something, I don't remember what but then everyone started laughing,it put everyone in a good mood.I think of laughing like fire,one candle can light @NUM1 candles.When you hear people laugh, the first thing that comes to your mind is,""something must be funny"".And you want to go and see what it is so you can laugh too. that's very common for most people who like laughing. personally I love laughing because its a good weird feeling."	15	16		31				3	3	4	4	3	3	4	3	4	3	3	3						
21145	8	"I would say laughter is something that comes from the heart. But really it is what is on the inside and how you really feel about the person and,how they feel about you,@CAPS1 that person makes you laugh you know that they really love you and care about you. @CAPS1 you make someone laugh and they make you laugh then you are with the one and only true person.Laughter is from the heart and soul. @CAPS1 that person Tell's you something that makes you laugh then it is true between you two. Feelings,@CAPS2, @CAPS3 is a lot between two people. @CAPS3 is from the soul and down deep with in your body. as my mom would say @CAPS3 helps clear the mind and body , but what i really think is that @CAPS1 some one makes you laugh they see the real side of who you really are and what you can become. you laugh about all kinds of things like jokes, funny videos, funny stories, and more. But the real thing is that at least someone make you laugh. @CAPS1 it say it is the important part of any relationship what it is trying to say or make a point of is that you need to laugh in your relationships and, have fun. But my thought about @CAPS3 is that you clear your mind and you have to listen about things and,then @CAPS4 it is funny then you start @CAPS3 about it. Here is what my mom use to says to everyone is that ""@CAPS4 you have not laughed at all today then you do not have a clear head or body"". There are times in peoples lives where they just laugh and laugh and have a hard time stopping that, i think @CAPS3 is just a feeling that people have. You @MONTH1 tell funny jokes that make people laugh but sometimes they do not even make any since at all. You could be out with a bunch of your friends and at a party and you are just standing around and then you start @CAPS3 because one of them decided that is was to quite and we all needed a laugh. There are sometime you can play a game that is really funny and you have to make funny things or even do crazy stuff, but it all comes down to one thing and one thing only you need a laugh once and, a while. I mean don't everyone need a laugh, I tell my self almost everyday that @CAPS4 I don't laugh then I did not clear my mind or soul. But is it really about me no it is not. @CAPS1 you say you need a laugh people look at you like you are crazy but you really aren't. What you are really trying to say is can you can tell something funny then people will understand what you mean. I have been told funny things over the past few years but im a teenager what do you think i will remember them all. I am just like everyone else I will forget them over the years real easy. I not all that smart but after I think about it for a few min I finally under stand the joke. I know I am a @CAPS5 but I have those days where I am saying what to people what are you talking about, then they look at me and, they just say wow! you really are @CAPS5 and I also have @CAPS5 jokes about me and I really do not mind @CAPS1 people tell @CAPS5 jokes to me. Cause I am not affected at all I got use to it. @CAPS1 I heard my first @CAPS5 joke I had to stop and, think about it for a few mins then after about an hour I realized that they where trying to tell me that it was me. Then I walk up to them and I was like ""@CAPS6 I finally got that joke and, then I was like what a really good joke. @CAPS1 you have a laugh for the first time is because that someone special either made you laugh or they tickled you. They might even tell you a very funny story about themselves, or someone that is related to them. @CAPS1 you laugh is like your showing your feelings and, @CAPS2 to that person, because @CAPS4 you do laugh then it is just like wow you are really lost on what they where trying to tell you. I will always tell my self @CAPS4 i need a laugh or something to either call my friends up or just look in the mirror every morning. because for some odd reason i think i am just really funny looking. most people think that @CAPS4 you look at your self and make funny faces in the mirror you will laugh non stop. the reason i laugh is because i see or hear something really funny o just wanna laugh so much. @CAPS4 i have a good day or a good weekend i laugh a lot"	17	15		32				4	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21146	8	"    Laughter is one of the many ways to share a memory. It is also a key component to story telling, it shows that the listeners are enjoying what you have to say. When you share a laugh or a smile with someone its almost as if your sharing a deep secret that no one else knows. Laughter is having something in common, it doesn't matter how much money you have or how old you are, a person always has the ability to burst out in laughter. Inside jokes are laughter's best friend, from the second they are made to the slightest mention of them, they always bring smiles and giggles to everyone's face.   As a person, I feel that it is my duty to make people laugh. One example of this would be when I was seven years old and spending the night at my friend @PERSON1's house. We had just gotten done watching @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and were super hungry for lunch. As it turns out @PERSON1's big sister @PERSON2 was the only one home, and she wasn't going to have anything to do with her ""baby sister"", so we were to fend for ourselves. Being young, we didn't want a boring old @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 sandwich, we wanted to make @NUM1 cupcakes! This might sound like a ridiculous objective for two seven year old girls, but we were surprisingly ambitious and tackled this with no problems, or so we thought. In reality it was a disaster, we had no idea what a mixer was so we mixed everything with our hands, which worked up until I brought the flower out. From now on I will never think of flower in the same manner, every time I open the jar of flower all I can think about is the mess @PERSON1 and I had made that day.   Lets just say it was a disaster, enough flower to successfully make @NUM1 cupcakes is approximately the whole bag. As I was getting ready to pour this tremendous quantity of flower into the bowl, I slipped on some of the vegetable oil that had spilled out of the measuring cup, and the flower went everywhere! @PERSON1 started laughing as soon as the white powdery cloud filled the room. As for me, I was still in shock, not to mention covered in what felt like enough batter to feed the entire world. Now that I am a quite a bit older, I don't think I could have taken such a tremendous mess so lightly, considering I would most definitely be the one cleaning it all up. But as a little girl, laughing was the only thing that mattered. @PERSON1 couldn't stop giggling as she was looking at my whole body covered in white. We started to play in the flower, picking it up and throwing it in the air as if it was confetti. When all of the sudden @PERSON2 came down the stairs, took one look at the kitchen and started to yell, ""@CAPS6 and clean this up! I was upstairs for and hour and you manage to make this big of a mess? Mom will be home in twenty minutes and you had better have this kitchen cleaned"" @PERSON1 and I looked up at each other and back at the kitchen. Then was when it hit me just how much work we had to do. All of the sudden I started laughing uncontrollably, it felt as if I had no care in the world.    It turns out that @PERSON1 and I completely ignored @PERSON2 and continued to play in the flower for those short twenty minutes. We were in the middle of building a fort in the kitchen surrounded by what we called ""snow"". I heard the slam of the front door as @PERSON1's mom walked into the house. It sounded like paper towels being ripped right from the dispenser. Because we didn't clean up anything, we in fact made the kitchen much worse, we made a split second decision to run down into the basement to pretend we had done nothing wrong at all. That @MONTH1 had been our biggest mistake, as soon as @ORGANIZATION1's mom saw the kitchen we heard a scream, ""@PERSON1! What is this??"" . Slowly we climb the stairs to the kitchen and @PERSON1 starts explaining herself. I choose to stay quiet because I had never gotten in trouble by someone that wasn't my own mom before. When @PERSON1 is done telling her story, her mom tells us to go downstairs. Both of us are on the verge of crying, when all of the sudden @PERSON1 starts laughing once again. I could think of nothing that would possibly be funny at this moment when she says, "" you still have flower in your hair"".    From this experience I have learned that sometimes, laughing is the only thing that will make you feel better. Even though I have moved away since this cupcake fiasco, I know that if I ever talk to @PERSON1 again we will begin laughing at just the mention of this story.

21147	8	" Laughter is a huge part of life, in fact it is all i wanted to see my grandfather @PERSON1, do before his final days. I remember when i was about five years old i loved to draw, it didn't matter what it was as long as i had fun. My grandpa would give me helpful tips on shading, texture, and the over all image itself. One of my favorite things to see was the smile on his face after I figured out how to use his techniques. We would always have a good time together, he was an artist himself who has painted most of the pictures in his house, along with a few at restaurants. I spent most of my childhood in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, which is where my grandparents lived. I can't remember the last time i was at @CAPS1 lanes bowling alley, but i can remember my first time. It was with my grandparents, and there was so much for a young kid like me to do there. Another time about @NUM1 years back, my grandpa went to heat up his coffee in the microwave, and instead of putting his coffee in, he found potatoes. He instantly made hash browns out of them and we had a good laugh. There is a lot i wish i got to do with my grandparents, like go fishing, or even camping. Yet there is a lot i did do with them, my grandpa also painted my boy scouts derby wooden race car. When ever i had a race or competition with boats, cars, or planes, he was the one to paint them. He would come to every race to see how i did, and for some odd reason i got @NUM2 place most of the time. My grandparents also had a collie dog named @ORGANIZATION1, i named him when i was young. He and I grew up like buddies together, and my grandpa @ORGANIZATION1 and I would always go on walks together. My grandpas favorite thing to do with the dog was train him. He's the most obedient dog I've ever seen, he would go to the mail man and get the mail to bring back, he opened and closed doors if it had a rope, he would even get my grandmas slippers in the bedroom. When i lived in @LOCATION4, @ORGANIZATION2, everyday after school i would be picked up by my grandparents and go to their house and wait to be picked up by my mom until i was old enough to be alone. Grandma would always help me with math homework and cook dinner and then afterwords grandpa would help me with drawing or turn my favorite @CAPS2 show on. When i was young i would go over to there house in the morning and grandpa would have recorded my favorite show ""@CAPS3 the @CAPS4"". Every morning that was the routine, and then breakfast. Later on in my life when I became more independent i didn't go over to their house as often as I used to and it is something I cant take back. A few home videos I've looked at recently reminded me of a good time with them, my grandpa was recording me chase the dog around the kitchen table and i stubbed my toe. Apparently it was humorous to my family, all who were laughing in hysterics. Another time when I as younger my grandpa was a barber shop owner and cut hair for years in @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, and at his house one time i didn't know what a ""mullet"" was but i knew it was a hair style. I pleaded and pleaded until he finally gave in and gave me a mullet hair cut, i was astonished to what it looked like and immediately hated it. The last @CAPS5 I spent with my grandpa I bought lot's of presents for him and my family. Thanks to the @DATE1 job i had on the eastern part of the state, i was able to get a heating blanket that covered his whole bed, a couple movies, and his favorite "" @CAPS6"" chocolates. I can honestly say it was the happiest I had saw him in a long time, which made me happy too. When the day is over and you reflect on how everything had gone, you will notice the best of times are only a laugh away."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21149	8	" Laughter is important in all relationships of any kind. If you have a friendship where you never laugh and nothing is ever funny, what is the point? I have four friends that mean the world to me. @PERSON2, @PERSON3, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS1. @CAPS1's real name is @PERSON1 but we all call her @CAPS1 because how she acts. @PERSON2 and I use to do almost everything together. We were inseperable, we went to school together, we even ate our meals talking to eachother. @PERSON2 and I can make eachother laugh no matter what the situation @MONTH1 be. I remember when @PERSON2 and I hadn't been getting along like we usually do. One day at around nine p.m. my phone rings, it was @PERSON2 I didn't know whether or not to pick up or to just pretend to be busy so the two of us didn't argue. Well I decided to pick up because it was the friendly thing to do and I knew that she would have been there for me. There was obviously a reason she called me, right? As I was about to say hello I could hear @LOCATION1 crying. I panicked, @PERSON2 was not one to just cry because of something little. I asked her what was wrong and told her to tell me all about it even though we were fighting I wanted to be there for her no matter what because she was always there for me. The @TIME1 before it had been @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, our whole posse or whatever you wanted to call it went together and everything had seemed fine except the usual pointless arguements that always ended in a laugh. Little did we know that the past two weeks @PERSON2's @CAPS3 had been ""house sitting"" he hadn't planned on returning home to his family. As i listen to @PERSON2 tell me the news and how hurt she was, my heart sank. While she cried I cried. Her @CAPS3, broke the news to her @DATE1 @TIME1 after we left for @ORGANIZATION1. He will not be returning home because he hasn't been happy there for awhile and he wanted a divorce. I knew exactly how @PERSON2 felt, my parents got divorced when I was very young. Although it didn't tear me apart like it did her it still effected me. Not having a real family with one home and two parents who were married and inlove was never easy on anyone. @PERSON2 had not the slightest idea that her @CAPS3 would later get married and start a family with a woman he had been seeing for over a year while coming home to his family. She just kept telling me that she had to bring him home, that she couldn't do this. @PERSON2 and her @CAPS3 were really close, she was daddy's girl one hundred percent. I remember her telling me that she just wanted to disappear it was all her fault. All I could do as her friend was listen and tell her it would be okay. @PERSON2 began to calm down and grasp the fact that things happen and she couldn't change her @CAPS3's mind. I invited @PERSON2 over for the @TIME1 to just hangout and maybe get thigns off her mind for awhile. It couldn't be easy sitting in her home with her @CAPS3 gone knowing he wasn't coming back. So @PERSON2 came over, we played guitar hero and everytime I messed up she would laugh. Hearing @PERSON2 laugh again made me feel better about things because I knew that she had figured out it was not her fault for her @CAPS3 leaving. Without the laughter in that room I'm not sure me and @PERSON2 would have been able to ever be good friends again. Afterall laughing at me messing up on guitar hero brought me and her back to being good friends again. So it's very important to have laughter in a relationship because once the laughter is gone then the friendship or whatever you know is going dowhill. Now @PERSON2 and I talk for endless hours or text about anythign and everything and when we aren't laughing we know to ask one another what is wrong."	16	20		36				4	3	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21161	8	" It was a day like any other. I was going to chess club to challenge the board one holder. I had never piercingly met him for I was new to the club, but I knew that if I didn't play @CAPS7 best I would lose. I entered the room hoping to see that the holder was not there, @CAPS2 was. @CAPS2 had on a blue baseball cap, a blue t-shirt, a pair of blue jeans, and a pair of black shoes. His hair was as dark as his shoes and looked as if @CAPS2 had not brushed it in years, his skin was very pale I wondered how @CAPS2 could go out in sun with out some way to block it. The board was set up and ready, @CAPS1 was the clock. the clock had an hour on each side. I walked up to him, @CAPS2 didn't even seem to notice me until I spoke, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS12 guna beat me fast. I know I'm guna lose."" @CAPS2 just sat there, staring at me like I had insulted him. ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS2 scoffed, ""your the kid they think can beat me."" ""I guess. I never really thought about it."" I was unsure as to why that would mater, but I was playing him, @CAPS1 I was absolutely sure that it was or was going to mater very soon. ""@CAPS4 please take @CAPS12 seat @CAPS1 we can begin the matches!"" the coach called out, ""@CAPS5, we all know the rules, the black player @MONTH1 start the white @CAPS4 clocks. No talking."" ""@CAPS1."" I said, ""your name is what."" ""@CAPS7 name is @CAPS8."" I hit the clock. Expecting him to be like lightning and move, I moved @CAPS7 piece. Bad move. @CAPS2 called and pointed out that I had moved a piece when it was not @CAPS7 turn. The coach came up to the clock and pressed some buttons, @CAPS2 didn't even look like @CAPS2 cared about the game and if a board ten holder could beat a board one holder. When @CAPS2 set the clock down the clock showed fifty to fifty five. I was already down on time and the game hadn't even really began.  @CAPS8 picked up the kings bishops pawn and moved it up one square. @CAPS2 hit the clock like lightning. That was wired @CAPS2 moved the weakest piece on the board. I had to stop and think for a vary long time or what felt like it. I looked over at the clock to see how I was doing on time. It was terrible I had been sitting there for about ten minutes and I hadn't even moved one lousy piece. @CAPS1 I picked up @CAPS7 king's pawn and moved up two squares hopping @CAPS2 wouldn't do anything that could hurt @CAPS7 in @CAPS13 game. I hit @CAPS7 clock.  We sat there for what must have been half an hour. @CAPS1 I got up and went to the bathroom. When I came back I checked on how the other @CAPS4 were doing. Only one game was done it was @PERSON1 and a kid I didn't know. I asked who won, it was the kid I didn't know as odd as that was I had to get back to @CAPS7 game.   @CAPS2 still hadn't moved, for a minute I thought @CAPS2 was having a problem breathing. @CAPS2 let out a yawn and moved his king's knight's pawn up two squares and hit the clock. That was weird, @CAPS2 just did fools @CAPS10. I didn't think for a minute, I piked up @CAPS7 queen and brought it all the way to one square in front of his rook pawn. I said ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10."" in a loud voice.  @CAPS2 started to laugh, at first I was confused for I beat him.Then @CAPS2 said,""I do @CAPS13 with every one I play for the first time, @CAPS13 opening.""@CAPS2 started to laugh again, @CAPS13 time I joined him we both were laughing because I beat him. Then @CAPS2 said, ""@CAPS12 are the first one to see that they could win in the first two."" That surprised me I thought that @CAPS2 won all the time when really @CAPS2 had been giving people games and the didn't know it. We started to laugh again, the coach came over and saw that I won @CAPS2 said good job and walked away. @CAPS8 said, ""@CAPS13 is the start of a new beginning I can quit board one now for there is someone who can beat me."" @CAPS2 walked up to the coach and must have told him that @CAPS2 wanted me on board one for now I'm on board one and @CAPS7 new friend, @CAPS8 is there with me on board two.

21174	8	"                   Laughter is the Shortest Distance Between Two People A thing we have done since birth is laugh. Laughter is something incredible in the world of human existence, it is something that relieves awkward situations, brings people together, and makes life a little bit easier. Laughter is something that everyone shares in common. Some people find laughter in different things than others but still we can all laugh together. Many times in my life has laughter helped me through tough situations, brought me close to someone, and just made life more enjoyable.   I remember once I was trying out for a volleyball team. It was the first day of tryouts and I was really nervous because I didn't know anyone. I had never even heard of these people and now I was going to be competing against them. There was one thing I knew about them though. It was that we all shared a common goal of making the team and being successful. Tryouts began and I felt like they were wondering why I was even there, but I ignored them and just kept working hard. Tryouts went okay for the rest of the week but still something just didn't feel right. I still felt like I didn't belong there. It was the last day of tryouts and the girls had warmed up a little, but I still felt a little uncomfortable. After the last practice it was time to announce the teams. I was really nervous cause what if I didn't make it? Or what if I did, but everyone hated me on the team? He announced the names and I was beginning to give up hope when he said my name. I was so excited, but the girls seemed to be annoyed by my name getting called. When I got home I told my parents and they were excited for me. I then told them how I didn't really know anybody and kind of felt like an outsider. They asked me if I had tried talking to anyone, and I said no not really they didn't try talking to me so I thought why should I? My mom then told me that I could only get to know them if put myself out there. I thought about it and realized I really hadn't. I ignored them as much as they ignored me. I also wasn't myself, because I really am a cool person and I am fun to be around, I just for some reason I crawled into a shell this time. I decided the next day at practice I would put myself out there. The next practice I showed up and was partnered up with a girl named @PERSON1. It was so awkward and at first we were just quiet passing the ball back an forth. Then I started talking to her and making jokes she laughed and I laughed and we had a great time. The rest of the practice went great. The awkward moments faded away into laughter. We all worked hard and joked around with each other, laughed, and I really felt like we were bonding. They laughter had brought us together. All this time it felt like we were so far away and different and really it wasn't like that at all. Having fun and laughing together showed us how much we had in common and that we were all the same. I believe that day that laughter brought our team together.  I will never forget that day. It was the day I learned how important laughter was in a relationship, getting to know someone, and how well it brings people together. That season of volleyball I made many new friends. I also learned a valuable lesson that and awkward situation can always be turned around by laughter. Today I still talk to those girls on the team and still today we all laugh together, just because you known someone for a while doesn't mean the fun and laughter has to fade away, because I believe it should get stronger. Whenever I am meeting new people I always try to break the ice and lighten up the mood with something funny, because I think that a big point in our lives is to be happy, have fun, and all laugh togther. That is exactly what I plan to do."	20	22		42				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	4	4	4						
21177	8	"The mood was sweet and the room was worm with most of my family and friends. except for my brother and at the time i was only about @NUM1 or @NUM2? Hell i can't really remember so I'm just going to guess on the age. Whatever getting back to the story, so I'm looking all around our @NUM1 story house trying to find my brother but for some reason this time it just seems impossible. And all I can hear in the back ground is my family laughing as this little @NUM1 or @NUM2 year old is running full speed up and down hallways and opening and closing doors to rooms that hes never been in be for. And also shouting at the top of his lungs ""@CAPS1 where you be at i can't finded you"". And with one more door to open that's at the beginning of the hallway where every one is sitting or standing. This little boy comes running down the hall in a panic who can't find his brother. And opens up the door and out pops @PERSON1 his brother who is wearing the scary monster mask and says ""I will get you tonight if you don't eat all your dinner"". So know what I did just as he told me to do. I ate my dinner so fast I ended up throwing up because a was so scared that he was going to come after me that night! And the funny thing is that this happened for the @DATE1 of my life so that the funny thing."	12	15	26	26				1	2	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	3	3	3
21183	8	" Hi my name is @CAPS1. I am just an ordinary girl with a story like every other girls. I'm writing this because this story means something to me and I would like to share @CAPS2. Honestly I depend on a good laugh during my day. Without laughter life would never be the same for me. Laughing has brought me to who I am today. Not only has @CAPS2 made me the person I am but @CAPS2 has brought me to all my friends and the people I love. For example I use laughter between me and my boyfriend @PERSON1.  @PERSON1 and I are just like any other couple. We have fun, do stuff together and we argue. The worst part is when we fight. just like everyone else we have hard time and we have good times. Our hard times all start when we wake up. When i wake up its still really dark outside. The smell of fresh @TIME1 air makes me feel refreshed. I always feel like the happiest girl in the world. A little while after i wake up i text @PERSON1 good @TIME1 and we usually, always talk through out the @TIME1. Some times he comes to see me or i just see him at school. When i see him i am happy and my toes curl. We will go for a walk and talk about everything and anything, just life. At this point he thinks its time to say something funny. So he does, he will make fun of how i look, what i am wearing and what i say. He doesn't find @CAPS2 hurtful but to me @CAPS2 is. Many times i might even say something mean back which doesn't help @CAPS2 just makes @CAPS2 worse.  Not long goes by, maybe a few seconds and we start to fight. He doesn't understand he has hurt me or he doesn't care. @PERSON1 tells me he has done nothing wrong. So i try to explain @CAPS2 and he doesn't listen. I just stop trying and if he realizes how he hurt me or what happened that bothered me that's fine but i am not going to fight anymore so i just stop explaining things. Enough has gone through my mind so i cry, and he gives me a dumbness look. This just makes everything worse so of course our fight breaks out and gets even worse. There is yelling and screaming with tears and mean, rotten words tossed all over the place its a mess. I usually storm of in the middle @CAPS2 cause i cant take anymore.  Finally time goes by and we haven't talked all day. We don't have anything to say to each other. Eventually someone gets the nerve to talk or say something to another. Still each of us on edge so i say something stupid or funny to lighten the mood. I will do anything to see a smile on his face, even if we have done each other wrong i still love him and cant stand for @CAPS2 to be like this anymore. Of course he smiles, just what i was looking for this makes me happy and laugh. @PERSON1 will than ask for a hug and so he hugs me even if i don't answer or if i say no, @CAPS2 doesn't matter to him. He apologizes and explains a couple things to me. I feel bad cause i hate the stress and the fight, so we work @CAPS2 out.  Now you can see if i didn't have laughter i might be depressed. Without laughter things would be harder and more complicated. But a good laugh or a simple joke can ease things and make them a lot better in life. I just want people to understand what a small laugh can do to your day. If @CAPS2 can change your day in such a big way than @CAPS2 can change your life in a major way. Things @MONTH1 come across as hard of rough. When i look back on my life and see what @CAPS2 has done to me and for me i realize i laughed at something each one of those days even though i was done and @CAPS2 brought me back up again."	18	18		36				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
21190	8	" When I was in what I believe to be the sixth grade I went to @ORGANIZATION1. This year I felt as if I was old enough to ride the "" big kid"" rides which I had never done before. I remember walking up to the entrance of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 hotel with my mom, older sister @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1 little sister @CAPS3. We had to go though there because it was the fastest way in to the park. There were to giant stain glass like windows that led into the lobby of the hotel. The door were beautiful. They had an outdoor seen on them there were bears, fish, trees, rivers @ORGANIZATION1 mountains. We all walked in to the hotel. The ceilings must have been twenty feet tall. We walk all the way though the lobby @ORGANIZATION1 followed the signs till we got to the park entrance. There was a man made mountain in the middle shaped like a grizzly bear that one of the rides was built around. It was early in the morning so the @LOCATION1 heat had not yet set in completely. We started out with the smaller rides @ORGANIZATION1 side attractions like it's tough to be a bug @NUM1,shopping in the park @ORGANIZATION1 parades. My mom was determent to get back in time to see @LOCATION2 on stage but we never made it back in time. It was about noon @ORGANIZATION1 the sun was hot. We were making our way to the pier. the song @ORGANIZATION3 by the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 was playing in the back ground. There were old sunscreen advertisements painted on the fence that was surrounding that end of the park. on the opposite side of the pier was a man made ocean that was so blue from all the dye it was unbelievable. It kinda looked like the water in the toilet when you put the blue cleaning product in it. The air smelled like fried food @ORGANIZATION1 popcorn, it was making me @LOCATION3. We continued walking until be got to the roller coaster @ORGANIZATION2'. There was a fifteen minuet wait time for the ride which wasn't long. my older sister @ORGANIZATION1 i jumped in line @ORGANIZATION1 began to wait. I had never been on a roller coaster this big before so I didn't know what to expect. I had butterfly in my stomach, I was getting nervous but didn't want to back down.  finally we came to the front of the line. the man standing there working the ride asked ""how many?"". my sister held up two fingers @ORGANIZATION1 the man pointed at the ground next to him @ORGANIZATION1 said ""row eight"". The next set of cars came in @ORGANIZATION1 they ushered us into the the eighth car in the row. I pulled down the safety bar. The ride began. The roller coaster cars pulled around the corner @ORGANIZATION1 stopped. There were speakers on both sides of my head that i had not noticed until the moment sound began to come out of them. It was a mans voice @ORGANIZATION1 some background music. the voice did a count down form ten @ORGANIZATION1 the yelled "" blast off"" @ORGANIZATION1 the ride took of at high speeds. It was going so fast my face was being pushed back into a smile. The ride then slowly climbed to the top of a giant hill @ORGANIZATION1 plummeted to the bottom. There were so many twists @ORGANIZATION1 turns the ride even when upside down! when it came time to take the picture at the end I was crying I was laughing so hard. my sister @ORGANIZATION1 I exited the ride @ORGANIZATION1 walked over to the booth were they show the pictures that they had taken of the people on the ride. Both of our faces were priceless. We then road the ride five more times before heading back to the hotel for dinner. From that day on I was addicted to roller coasters, @ORGANIZATION1 have ridden many since."	18	18		36				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
21198	8	"  On the year of @DATE1, my brother had the worst birthday headache ever. We lived in a nice big brown house. with great to loving parents. we had a nice big back yard, my brother and I loved that the most. @CAPS1 was down stars making my brother and i school lunches for school. It was my brothers first day of school and he was so happy. I mean its his birthday and he also starts school on the same day, thats awsome. @CAPS1 let my brother walk to school with me, it was only down the road. The school my brother and i went to is called @LOCATION1. When we got to the school, I could tell my brother was worried. School to me didn't seem that bad but I wasn't the one who was caught eating glue ether. Yeah my brother was caught eating glue during arts and crafts before lunch. When I was on my way to the office I say him through the window. He turned his head and smilled, I could see all the glue still wet and it's everywhere.  My brother and me always had a good relationship, we both mad each other laugh all the time. If my brother and I didn't laugh at each other, we probable wouldn't talk to each other. Laughter to me is a very importent part to any kind of relationship. It alows poth people to share their emotions in a positive way. It also helps people see what kind of sence of humor you have.  As we approched the house, we saw @CAPS1 sitting on the porch waitting for us. After we got home my brother went straight to his room to get cleaned up for his birthday. @CAPS1 had my brother do the dishes, and I do the vacuming in the living room. She always wanted the house cleaned even if people dont come over. @CAPS1 said the whole family was coming over. My brother and i were so happy, we both new grandma was coming. When everyone got here we both were very happy. Grandma showed up alittle after dad did. @CAPS1 was in such a hurry, she wanted to see my brothers face when he saw his birthday cake. When grandma comes she always brings gifts for both of us on are birthdays. When my brother was at the table @CAPS1 brang in the cake. I always see my brother happy, but not like this. I could tell that nothing could make his day any happier.  When the birthday cake was over and the presients, my brother and i went out to the back yard to play kickball. My brother wouldnt use his new soccer ball, we were stuck with a basketball to play with. @CAPS1 and grandma were watching us play, we both were having fun. We laught every time I kicked the ball wrong, or if he missed when he tried to kick the ball. As we were kicking the ball I got an idea. I wound my leg back and as the ball came close i kicked it. I kicked the ball so hard and so fast, insted of the ball going to his feet it went to his head. When the ball conected to his head he did a back flip off the ground. @CAPS1 and grandma were in aw, i was frozen still. When he got up he looked straight at me and laught. @CAPS1 started to laugh so did grandma, i was still frozen. I finaily went with it and by the time I started i couldnt stop. it was so funny, he got pickup off the ground and hit in the head with a ball and still laughs.   When it was time for everyone to go, @CAPS1 said her good byes and then it was grandmas turn. Grandma gave my brother the first kiss on the forhead than me. As grandma was leaving my brother and i sat on moms lap and gave her a big hug and said ""I love you @CAPS1"". @CAPS1 was tcking us in bed and was about to leave when my brother said "" @CAPS1 my head hurts"". I love my family and even today we look back on this and laugh. This has been a joy to write i hope you think so to.  Short story by   @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1"	17	17		34				4	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	3	3						
21206	8	"One day I woke @CAPS6 staring out my window and was listening to the birds chirp out my window I usually leave my window open to sleep with fresh air because I hate breathing in my own breath its to warm anyways as I woke @CAPS6 I walked out and ate some rice crispy s with my to sisters @PERSON2 and @PERSON3. As I was about to finish I had realized I was late for school I was only I @NUM1 grade so I ran got dressed and told my sisters to @CAPS5 and get ready but you no how girls can be putting @CAPS4 there make-@CAPS6 and doing there hair.      My sister @PERSON2 was in @NUM2 grade and my other sister was in @NUM3 grade our schools were right next to each other so they finally got ready and we were @CAPS4 our way heading off to school ready for an awesome day with my teacher @PERSON4hawk. She wasn't the nicest teacher in the world but I only liked her was because when we were cleaning our desk she gave us shaving cream and me and my friend @PERSON1 would have so much fun playing in the cream. We began the day with a book and the book was by ""@CAPS1 foul"" I can't recall the name but I remember the cover was gold an was about ghouls and monsters the way she read it was like if we were there that book was so intense even tho i really didn't understand it. Next she would give us a math worksheet I know right math in @NUM1 grade but I was really smart at math and she would always pick @CAPS4 me and give me harder math then others and when I asked her why I was getting harder math then the other kids she had told me I was different. I new I was smarter then some kids but not all so I never knew if that was a complement or an insult but I really didn't care. So now that we got that out of the way we can get to the fun part were all the laughter is so school is over right and I'm trying to find my sister to walk me home, after @NUM5 min looking for i find her walking to the cross walk I yell her name ""@CAPS2"". She looks and I'm running to her and her friends as you no she didn't want to be seen with an annoying little brother so she ran across the street.   My dad was waiting in the car and my sister got to the car before me and I was in a @CAPS5 to get to the car and I had to wait for the cross guard lady to @CAPS3 to me. At last she finally had noticed me, I was @CAPS4 walking in an hurried past to get to the car because I had herd my dad yelling ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6""so I was walking faster and faster and as I was walking I herd from a distance a car speeding down the street, but what I hadn't noticed it was it was heading straight for me. The car came flying around the corner nearly hit the cross guard lady, the car had hit the crossing stick the out of no were I was hit flying and rolling down the street. I was hit and bruised cuts every were my dad was panicking ran out of the car screaming at the lady who had hit me and getting her information license plate number.    As I was laying @CAPS4 the ground my dad came to me and was trying to get me @CAPS6 he pulled down my pants to see the damage and remember I had my scooby-doo underwear @CAPS4 and every one was staring at me I was more embarrassed then hurt I didn't feel the pain until the next day so I was all good I couldn't walk so my dad ran put me in the car and every one was laughing at me because they saw my underwear @CAPS4 and my dad rushed me to the house and then called the ambulance. they told my dad that I would be able to walk again but would have trouble doing sports because i have a fractured hip. i was living the dream my sisters were spoiling me giving me candy and my dad giving me ice cream and @CAPS4 top of that I couldn't feel the pain. Bu t the fireman said I should be able to go to school the next day and I did and my mean old teacher saw me and i was limping and what she told me got me mad she had told me to ""stop faking it"". I had told my mom that and she got so mad man you would not want to be that teacher so lets say it wasn't pretty. You're probably wondering what happened to the lady who hit me she pays for my docter bills. "	12	18	34	34				3	3	3	3	2	2	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	3
21217	8	"So my friends and i got into a heated discusion on how we need to keep things to our selves cause one of my friends told people some personal things about us. He caused us allot of problems in school and around town, @CAPS1 he started to lie to us one of my other friends lost it and went after him and tackled him down told him to quite lying. By the time he let him up and we all got back in are seats he started to spill his guts to us, he told us some rumers he started about us and some other things he did we kinda all lost it. So we calmed down a little then took turns talking to him, after my two friends talked it was my turn i was talking to him and he kept interupting me, finally i got mad and i grabed something off the floor to throw at him. Don't git me wrong not to hurt im to stop him from interupting me. I reached down grabed something soft without looking picked it up and threatened to throw it at him and he started to point and laugh, I stoped turned my head to look at what was in my hand. now remember it was an intense conversation you could cut the tension with a nife, for him to start laughing and everyone join in i didnt want to know. But i turned my head looked and fell over laughing it was a stuffed fairy i picked up off his floor i did through it at him, but playfully. We all finally stoped laughing and sat back down. I believe that it calmed us down enough to help exsplain and make things better for him and all of us. the moral of the story is even though your mad something will always make you smile and make your day better ."	11	16	30	30				3	2	3	3	2	2	3	3	3	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3
21224	8	" Laughter is one of the most amazing things that the human body is able to do. The sound of laughter is as unique as the sound of crying. There are many things that can cause people to laugh. And once you start laughing, you can't stop. Laughter is caused by something that is humorous, so it's mostly the cause of laughter that makes it so much more fun. And it usually depends on who you are with, where you are, and in what kind of situation you're in before you can actually start laughing. Kind of like the time when I was in @LOCATION2 baking a pie with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2.....  It was a nice warm evening in @LOCATION2, and I was making a pie with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We had out all the ingredients necessary to make the pie until my @CAPS1 points out there's no more sugar. She tells me to go to the covers and grab a jar of sugar. So I went, and there were two jars when I opened the covers I asked her which of the two jars is the sugar because they had no lables on them. ""I think its the the jar on the left"", she said. I grab the jar on the left side without another word.  Later on while everyone was sitting down talking with one another, my @CAPS1 and I go and get the pie to serve to the family. They all looked at the pie in awe as we took it out and started slicing it. After everyone was served they all took a bite out of it. Imidiately in just seconds everybody starts spitting it out like it was the worst thing that they have ever put in there mouths'. Suddenly my @LOCATION1 makes a comment saying that the pie is too salty..... not exactly the kind of comment I was expecting. Then my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 goes and checks to see the jar that I had grabbed from the covers. She sticks her finger in the jar and tastes it. Luckily enough, it was the salt jar. Then out of no where everyone starts to laugh into tears at the thought of what just happened. It was the most fun I had that evening, nobody could stop laughing. Clearly, the situation with the pie was something that I will surely never forget, and it'll probably never happen again. And after all that happend with the pie ended up being the kind of situation that makes you laugh. This shows that the three causes of laughter is real. First, I was with my @CAPS1. Secondly, I was in my @LOCATION1's house where there has to be at least one funny thing that can happen there. And also what happened with the salt and the sugar was a completely unexpected situation that turned out to be unmistakeably hilarious. And to think that this event happened all because of the three main causes of laughter. Laughter is one of the most amazing things that the human body is able to do. Laughter will always be one of those things in life that cannot ever be destroyed. If you are a person who says that they've never laughed, then you are a liar and a hypocrite. Being able to laugh is good for you and your health. It gives you extra oxygen in your lungs to help you breathe easier and it's a lot of fun. So if you ever notice that you haven't laughed, stop imidiately and take the time to have a laugh.  "	20	23		43				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	4	5	4						
21225	8	" Laughter--as we all know @CAPS4--is a visual expression of happiness, or in inward feeling of joy. @CAPS4 @MONTH1 insure from telling a joke, being tickled, or from some other random stimuli. @CAPS4 is in most cases, a very pleasant sensation. By that means, laughing has an enormous impact on each and every one of us throughout our everyday lives. Laughter tends to enlighten our emotions by expressing them in many good, cheerful, and lastly, positive ways. However, @CAPS4 is proven that laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze.When laughter is shared, @CAPS4 binds people together and increases the intimacy and happiness. Around @TIME1--which happens to be exactly when my third period class begins, I was supposed to be in my @CAPS1 class at the time, but with my luck--I wasn't. You are probably thinking, ""@CAPS2, if she is not in her third period class, then where is she?"" I actually ended up in the computer lab, beginning my state writing test once again. I defiantly wasn't too thrilled about taking the writing test over again, but in my heart, I knew deep down inside that I could pass the state writing test this time without any if, and, or buts, which are also known as the worst things ever--excuses. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that I was going to walk out of the room, realizing that I could of done better--that's for sure. My self confidence was set to an exceedingly high standard with absolutely no negatives thoughts to think of. I was ready to face the test--once again. As soon as I entered the computer lab, I almost nearly sat down as fast as a fly trying to dodge a fly swatter. I took an immense deep breath--like usual, and began to log into the computer. In between the time I was waiting for my computer to get logged in, I sat there gazing around the room, with nothing more to do, then to visualize what I was going to type my state writing test about. Once the teacher approved my log-in, I started typing all of my private information into the blank squares, so that I could begin my next steps.Within seconds I was ready to begin my test. On the screen appeared several topics that were listed below to choose from, but there was only one of them that I felt most satisfied with, and that I felt I could score exceedingly high in. The topic was, ""We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was on element or part.""  The minute I selected that subject, I honestly had no idea what I was going to write about because during my childhood life I had numerous laughter moments that had occurred, and nearly every story that I could remember had to of been more than @NUM1 words. So, I quietly sat there thinking-- just how I knew I would be.  During the moment, I heard this very irritating sound, which was the from the many taps from the kid's keyboards, and numerous annoying clicks from the computer mouses. @CAPS4 was very obvious that the students understood their topic quite @CAPS2--unlike me.  Minutes had flew by so quickly, and yet, still nothing. Not a single story to share about laughter. By then, I was very upset with myself, because if you really think about @CAPS4, who does not have a story to write about that deals with laughter? I knew I had some sort or kind of story to share, @CAPS4 was just harder for me to summarize one up and type about @CAPS4.  Just then, as I was going to begin my essay, a younger student, (that had been taking a state reading test), loudly shouted, ""@CAPS3!"" The little kid not only caught myself, but the rest of the class as @CAPS2. I honestly swear @CAPS4 was a ""had to of been there moments."" @CAPS4 wasn't just for the fact that he said @CAPS3 exceedingly loud, but the expression that was on his face, and the way he announced @CAPS4 to everyone in the computer lab--@CAPS4 nearly killed me inside. The little boy was so thrilled and proud of himself that he had passed. Obviously he was very eager to let the entire class know--which is probably something I would have done as @CAPS2.  Almost as quickly as he announced @CAPS4, I knew this was a laughing moment to not only remember, but to share with others as @CAPS2. In fact, if truth be told, this short story just so happened to not only make my day, but he had made my state writing assessment topic many times less stressing for me. Clearly as you can see, laughing indeed does seem to have an enormous impact on each and everyone of us throughout our everyday lives, and sometimes those moments are meant to be shared."	25	25		50				5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5

There are a lot of times where laughter was the biggest part of our friendship. But @CAPS3 not sure if we just think were funny or if people think were funny. My two best @CAPS2 are @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2. I've actually know both of them since we were little. It was about second grade when we became @CAPS2. Although we were never really close until about sixth grade. Now days @CAPS3 closer @CAPS1 @LOCATION2, then I am to @LOCATION1. I remember when @LOCATION2 and I would throw little pieces of eraser at each other across the room nearly missing our teacher. The first memory I remember @CAPS1 @PERSON2 was maybe when we were in third grade. We would goof off and mess around in @LOCATION3. The three of us haven't hangout a lot since high school started. It also doesn't help when we each go to different schools. But when @LOCATION2, @PERSON2 and I do hangout were always laughing and having a good time. One example of laughter bringing us together, is when we went to @PERSON1 skate park for my birthday a few years back. @PERSON2's grandma was taking us there and along the way we asked if we could stop and get @ORGANIZATION1. I just got an @CAPS4 camera for my birthday so I decided to bring that along. We went the the @ORGANIZATION1's located on @NUM1 street. As we were going through the drive-thru and @PERSON2's grandma was ordering. @PERSON2 decided to roll his window down and started ordering stuff for himself at the same time his grandma was. He asked for a @ORGANIZATION2 and a large fry. What made this really funny was that his grandma was getting mad. She told @PERSON2 to stop and told the person over the mic not to listen to the male voice in the background. But @PERSON2 kept doing it anyways. When we were pulling up to the window to get the food @PERSON2 told his grandma to pull up far enough so he could get the food. So as we were pulling up @PERSON2 rolled his window up down and got the food. @CAPS3 so glad I brought my camera and recorded the whole thing. When we got there we hopped out of the car and went to the park. It was later in the day when we got there, probably about three or four. At first none of us really skated cause we were looking around. But when we did start skating we stayed there for about four or five hours. Cause when we left it was dark outside. There are four stair sets there, the two stair, the three stretch, the three block and the five stair. That's the order they go in from size and how hard it is to @PERSON3 them. Cause we were there for so long we had a lot of videos recorded. Some where of us skating, some where really random and funny, then others I don't know what the heck was going on in them. Later that day when we were tired and bored of being there @PERSON2's grandma came and picked us up. They both came over to my house when we got back. We just watched @CAPS5 and played video games. Its always funny to watch one of us get frustrated because were not winning. Eventually we stopped and listened to music. Around @NUM2 p.m @PERSON2 went home and @LOCATION2 stayed the @TIME1. As we were in my living room he was messing around @CAPS1 the tri-pod I had got @CAPS1 my camera. As he has it in his hands, he's unscrewing it and it falls apart. We both laught at first but then I got mad cause I just got that. This day was really fun, it was full of laughing, dedication to skating, and our friendship. It was a day that I felt closer to @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2.  "	16	20		36				3	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21246	8	" Laughing at @CAPS1 bell. @CAPS11 best friend and I have a lot of funny, hilarious memories together. We are always laughing about something even if @CAPS7's something completely stupid or actually really funny. We laugh at things like people that look funny, or people that say stupid things. Also we laugh at funny things we do. @CAPS8 one thing that has always stuck to @CAPS11 head, the time at @CAPS1 bell. One day after school, me and @CAPS11 best friend @PERSON1 decided to go across the street from our school and eat lunch at @CAPS1 bell. We ordered our food and went to sit down and wait for @CAPS7. A few minuets later our food was ready and we sat down to eat @CAPS7. ""@CAPS4"" I said to @LOCATION1 as i took a bite of @CAPS11 @CAPS5 five layer burrito. ""@CAPS6""@CAPS7 was really hot and burned @CAPS11 mouth. I had to wait for a few minuets to eat @CAPS11 burrito. So we both just sat, waiting for our burritos to cool off, an talked about school and other things that was going on with our lives. A couple minuets later a man walked in, he was about @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old, and he had his back against us so we couldn't see his face. The man ordered his food and turned around to take a seat. Meanwhile I thought @CAPS11 burrito was cooled down enough and i went to take a bite, at the same time the man looked at us and he was wearing a clown mask and he had a little dog with a tiara on his head. Next thing i knew @CAPS11 burrito was coming out of @CAPS11 mouth and I was dieing of laughter.  @CAPS11 burrito was spit completely out of @CAPS11 mouth, and all over me an @LOCATION1. All over @CAPS11 hair, mouth, clothes, and all over the table. I was so embarrassed that i couldn't help @CAPS8 to laugh. I think the main reason i was laughing so hard was because the man was just so scary looking, @CAPS8 wow we were laughing for what seemed like an hour straight. You might think this was the end of @CAPS11 bad day, @CAPS8 @CAPS7 only gets worse. Eating @CAPS11 burrito seemed forever, because we were laughing forever. @CAPS7 probable took me a good ten minutes to eat a single burrito. Meanwhile i got thirsty and needed something to drink. So I went to order a small drink and get some @CAPS10. As i was returning to @CAPS11 table i wasn't looking and ran into a man that was in line. I almost spilled @CAPS11 @CAPS10 @CAPS8 luckily I didn't. Returning to @CAPS11 seat i was talking to @PERSON1 about how bad @CAPS11 day was, and how @CAPS7 couldn't get any worse. Then i took a drink an I started to choke on @CAPS11 @CAPS10, @CAPS7 was so bad that i spit everything out onto @LOCATION1, @CAPS10 went flying everywhere, @CAPS7 even came out of @CAPS11 noes. So i went into the bathroom, and cleaned @CAPS11 self up, caught @CAPS11 breath, and told @PERSON1 i was ready to go home. When i look back and think about the day at @CAPS1 bell with @CAPS11 best friend, I not only think about how embarrassing @CAPS7 was for me and her, @CAPS8 also that @CAPS7 was a really great, hilarious memory that i will probably remember for the rest of @CAPS11 life. As i said before @CAPS11 best friend and I have a lot of funny memories together, and still we are making more everyday."	17	20		37				4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21256	8	" Boy says too @CAPS2:@CAPS1 weigh?, @CAPS2: what? Boy:@CAPS3 i just wanted too say something to break the ice!Laughter is the greatest thing too have in any kind of relationship, such as family, friends, and a romantic type relationship. It bring each other great bondage and makes the relationship playful.It was @DATE1 and i was on my way too pick up a long time no see friend too go to a warped tour concert. We haven't been in the greatest terms because of an issue that was upon us a few months ago. I figure to take my friend @CAPS4 to a concert shes been wanting to go too all year long. When we finally picked her up there was all sorts of tension of unleft said words to each other, but i wasn't gonna wait any longer too see what was about too happen.Before we headed too the concert my parents decided too get a car wash, @CAPS5 then i automatically thought of a few funny things i could do to make her laugh. The car moved as slow as a turtle into the car wash machine. I had left the window crack open to were enough water would crawl in. We were kinda talking about the concert and i had looked very unaware that my window was open, i actually had too no idea that a lot more of water then i expect had came in. She looked across at me and was like laughing so hard see couldn't even speck of what was happening. I looked at her and was like what? She was your windows open and i had turned and came too find water was rushing its way down and sorta frightened me and i jumped into the air and rushed too close the window. She was laughing like there was no tomorrow and so was i. From that moment on it was such an ice breaker for all the tension that was happening. the elephant had left or side and we had a great rest of the day. See, it true""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"". When laughter is happening no one is truly sad, mad or anything else. Laughter can bring too people who just meet good greetings, too couples closer together, friend and family joy and happiness. Laughter is truly the key to happiness.

21258	8	" I think that laughter is a key element to any lasting relationship, because if you didnt have laughter then that would be one boring relationship. Let me share with you a personal story of my own.  I recently just started dating my boyfriend and his name is @CAPS1. We first met here at school and then he transfered and moved away, then a few months ago he added me on facebook and we started talking again. At the time we had started talking he had a girlfriend but shortly after finding me again he realized that she was not the one for him anymore. It was rough for him to break up with her but he did it and i am proud of him, becuase she treated him very bad.  In the beggining of our relationship we were both really shy and didnt talk much but the more and more that we hang out the more we start talking. We want to be the type of couple that can talk to each other about anything in person the way that we do in texts. Everytime i see him i get really nervous and it almost seeems as if my heart skips a beat. Whenever we are walking down a street i cannot help but to smile. And when we lay on the cowtch and watch movies i can't help but to laugh when he tickles me. We laugh at each other all the time, wether its when one of us makes a mistake or what not. I believe that laughter and the way we get along is what keeps us going strong. Everytime he leaves i cannot wait to see him again. Laughter is what keeps most relationships going because without it i feel like it would be a really boing and if it is boring than you wouldn't want to spend time with one another. I personally think that every moment with your significant other should be fully taken advantage of."	18	20	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4

I already have recognized in believing it my self. I also will explain its key element in part of the world. So to start us off I will tell you a story that has laughter in which fixed a few ed between my grandpa @CAPS1 and my cousin @PERSON1. To start off it had happened about some time during the @DATE1. We were all having a blast. There was my cousins @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and his little brother @PERSON3, @PERSON1 and I. So @PERSON2, @PERSON4 and I were minding are business playing games while our grandpa was watching us play and then out of no were we here a loud smack and then crying and screaming. So it had turned out that @PERSON1 ""slipped"" and smacked @PERSON3 who is only seven years old.Then our grandpa starts yelling and trying to figure out what the heck went down. After seeing @PERSON3's back with a big red hand mark on it that's when grandpa really let loose and just started going ballistic all over @PERSON1 but then @PERSON1 went home all piste. So later on @PERSON1 came back and then grandpa and I sat at the table talking to him. That's when I mentioned something that started to make every one laugh so hard that they all forgot what happened then he said sorry to @PERSON3 and we were all happy by the time grandma got home from work.So to conclude my story I wish to remind you on why laughter is an element or if it plays a part in something which was a true story in part of my life. So thanks for listening and when you or someone is down in the dumps or just really mad, laughter is the medicine for the job."	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21273	8	"Most people think that laughter helps you live longer, love longer, and show who you really are. I believe all of that is true, laughter is one of the most important things a person can do. In my life laughter has helped me threw the hardest situations and made them a lot better. You can laugh a lot with friends, family, or people you barely even know. Laughing can mend relationships and help you get threw anything, in my life i have found that out many times.My mother and myself haven't always had the best relationship, we don't always get along, and since i have a severe separation anxiety from her we spend a lot of time together which can cause friction from being together too much. There was a certain time when we had just gotten into a fight about me wanting to go somewhere and her not letting me, i was expecting her to be mad at me for awhile for how rude i was being. We didn't talk for a couple hours and tried to stay away from each other, we would only talk to each other if it was really important. After a couple days of this going on i went into her room to talk to her about it all, when we talked i understood why she was so mad at me and i apologized and left her room, but i could still feel that there was some tension between us. I wanted to make things better more then i have ever wanted anything, i wasn't really sure if she was ready to get over this fight, so i thought it would be better to give her some space and let her come to me when she was ready to talk. We both tried to stay away from each other for the rest of the day trying to cool off and really think about what we were truly mad about. The next day we went to go do somethings around town, some grocery shopping and to see some family. In the beginning we didn't really talk much or anything. Within an hour of us leaving the house and having our alone time together we were joking around and laughing at everything each other said. After our errands we went out to lunch, it was the funnest time i had ever had with my mom, we talked about everything and laughed and had an amazing time. The days after that were wonderful also, we spent a lot of time together and felt like we didn't want to leave each other, i know that laughing together and talking really helped with that, we opened up to each other like we never had before. I love my mother and care for her more then anyone in the world, when we got into that fight i was scared out relationship would never be the same again, we were able to work it out by laughing. I honestly think that laughter can cure anything, from a broken heart to a broken family."	17	17		34				3	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	3	3

I swear I thought we were all going to die in that car! We had the air conditioning on, but @CAPS2 didn't help much, I was in the middle of my cousin, @CAPS4, and @CAPS3. We finally got to a rest stop, and we all kinda stumbled out of the car. @CAPS3 wanted to go get a drink, so I followed. I'm pretty sure we were getting weird looks from all the people around us at this point. I was in my @LOCATION1 @CAPS6's, and @CAPS3 was in @CAPS8 @CAPS9. @CAPS2 felt like @CAPS2 had taken @NUM2 minutes to just walk to the drinking fountain. @CAPS2 was really that hot. I opened a cliff bar, while @CAPS3 was getting a drink. That is when I heard her scream. Of course, I busted up laughing, even though I didn't know what had happened. @CAPS3 turned around, and that laughter, turned to hysterical screaming. The mouth thing on the fountain had been turned towards you when you drink, so @CAPS3 was drenched. I sarcastically said, ""@CAPS12, you won't be hot for a while now will ya?"" We both laughed, and she chased me, trying to get me soaked. Sometimes, all you can do is laugh together. Later that day, when we finally reached the family reunion, they had a pool. She tried to push me in, but I took her with me. Everyone was laughing at that point. I don't think I have ever laughed so hard, than I did last @DATE2.

21280	8	"                                    Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 For the @ORGANIZATION1 is a very important thing in life , I personally could not live without laughter in my life I honestly could not do it. I would not be me if I didn't have laughter in my life . All relationships should have laughter involved in some way ,what would a relationship be without laughter! Laughter is a beautiful thing , when I am laughing I am enjoying life in in my own way and my worries instantly go away and some how I feel like I am ""carefree "" . Laughter makes us healthy both physically and mentally . Through out my life there have been many times where laughter has been involved in many relationships . But let me tell you about a time where laughter really stood out and was and still is a big part of my relationship with my dad.   I have always been very close to my dad , you might even say I am a daddy's little girl .Laughter has played a very important role in my relationship with my dad. It somehow always found its way into our relationship. The @CAPS1 times of laughter are what I valued and treasured so much that whenever I think about it I cant help but smile . I remember when I was little if I ever needed a @CAPS1 laugh my dad was the person to call . The laughter grew stronger through out the years , I cannot recall a time where my dad and I had a moment where laughter was not involved . We always used to watch these @CAPS3 shows together that we would almost always laugh so hard it was impossible to get through the show without making noise or miss something because we were both laughing so hard .We would laugh so hard we would wake up the whole family ,sometimes we didn't even know why we were laughing it would just happen . I can just hear those sweet sounds of laughter between my dad and I oh how I miss those @CAPS1 @NUM1 nights were what I looked forward to, I knew that I would soon be laughing along with my dad and tears of joy would be running down our faces . I looked forward to that sweet sound of laughter it was almost impossible to go through the entire show without laughing ,oh what @CAPS1 times those were . Since my dad moved to @LOCATION1 ,we haven't had those beautiful times of laughter that I miss so much, but I can always treasure them in my heart. Those moments of laughter were the best moments I have ever had with my dad,since I was little girl till now almost an adult . I don't know if my dad and I would be as close today if we hadn't had all that laughter throughout our lives. Whenever I am sad or miss my dad , I go back to those times we had filled with laughter, and listen to his laugh playing in my head. I never knew how important laughter would be to me. I am glad laughter played such an important part in my life. Laughter is such an important part of life/relationships because it brings joy and happiness. Laughter is the type of thing that no matter what , should always be a part of any relationship. I think laughter is healthy for our bodies, for example if you're sad ,depressed ,or just not having a @CAPS1 day a @CAPS1 laugh will change that and make you feel a lot better ,like it did for my dad and I. Laughter also makes relationships last longer , the reason why I am so close to my dad , best friend, mom, boy friend , sisters etc is because of laughter itself . If laughter was not involved in my relationships , I could not handle being sad all the time everyone needs a little laughter sometime in their life. My dad is the reason why I laugh so much , he showed me how laughter is such a powerful thing but yet so simple. I never thought laughter would be such an important part of my life until my dad showed me just how valuable it really is.  Where I would be today without laughter I truly have no idea. My dad taught me how laughter can change your attitude on things and how important it is to have laughter in your relationship. If laughter was not involved in any relationship , the world would be very boring no laughter or smiles,can you imagine having no laughter at all! I certainly cant imagine life without laughter. If my relationship with my dad had no laughter we would not be the same people we are today in fact , we would be completely different people and we would not be as close as we are today. What do you think about laughter? Has laughter ever played an important part in any of your relationships?  "	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21289	8	" I once learned something very valuable in school. I didn't learn it in a class room, or even form a book. I learned this lesson in a hallway near the copy room. One @MONTH1 be prompted to ask, what kind of lesson could you possibly learn in a hall? All I will tell you is this, it's not one I'll be forgetting any time soon.  In order to completely understand what exactly I was doing roaming the halls and learning lessons, you're going to need a little bit of background. I was in my third period class; which was leadership at the time. Leadership isn't really your conventional class from the perspective of an outsider. Kids running about the school like loose mice @MONTH1 give off an appearance of impropriety, but an appearance is all it was. We weren't doing anything bad, it's just that most of the time you would have to leave the class room in order to do what needed to be done that day. Leadership directly preceded myleast favorite class of the day, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I simply detested that class. I had been in @CAPS1 classes ever since I was in kindergarten at @ORGANIZATION1. I was a sophomore at the time and that language had been bugging me for the past ten years. It wasn't that I was bad at it or anything because really, I wasn't. I just had a strong contempt for @CAPS1 class. The teacher always gave me a hard time, probably because I had a big mouth and I tended to talk a lot. She was that type of person who had @CAPS10 posture and was a stickler for the rules. The the type of person you could see wielding a yard stick as a deadly weapon.  In leadership that specific class period, the teacher was taking a particularly long time explaining what we were supposed to do that day. He sometimes did this, he was famous for being long winded. He could take the entire @NUM1 minute class period just talking about an assignment that would have taken ten minutes to do. That day however, we weren't doing an assignment. At least not what a normal person would consider to be your typical assignment. Another girl from the class, @CAPS5; and myself were working on a special project. We had to retrieve something very important from my car. We waited for the teacher to finish talking and asked if we could go, he said yes. We walked out the double doors of the classroom and into the main hallway, we then proceeded on down toward the parking lot. As we were walking we passed by the office doors, the @CAPS6 hall, and the library. Just as we were about to walk by the copy room door, I saw @PERSON2. @PERSON2 was in my @CAPS1 Two class the year before and I thought that I would say hi to him. I did, I then asked if he was taking @CAPS1 @CAPS2 that year. He replied with a no. I told him, ""@CAPS10 thing, because @CAPS1 @CAPS2 sucks!"" I didn't know it at the time, but I would be eating those words by the truck load in just a short while. Not five seconds after I had said that to @PERSON2, @CAPS5 was tugging on my shirt sleeve trying to get me out of the building. I told her to calm down and that it was rude to interrupt people when they are talking.  After I had said bye to @PERSON2, @CAPS5 hurried me out the door and she burst into laughter. I was taken-aback by her sudden outburst of laughter and questioned her as to what she was laughing about. It was right then that @LOCATION1, my @CAPS1 teacher, poked her head out the door and said to me in her thick accent, ""@PERSON1, I hear you don't like my class!"" I must have been as red as a tomato. I just stood there with the dumbest look on my face. The kind of look that jumps on your face when you wish you had a rewind button for your mouth. I looked over my right shoulder just in time to see @CAPS5 gasping for air because she was laughing so hard. I redirected my attention to @LOCATION1, she was just standing there with an angry face covering up the laughter that was trying to break through. There I was, not ten steps away from my car and I, for once, had nothing to say. The lesson I learned that day was to never insult an alligator until you've crossed the river. Or at least make sure the alligator isn't in the next room. Especially if the alligator teaches your next class. "	23	26		49				5	5	5	5	5	4	6	5	6	5	5	5

We were so excited about it that that's all we could talk about. This would be the first camping trip we had been on without our parents. It would be the best four days of our lives. Sand, the beach, friends, quads, no parents; how could it possibly get any better than that?  We invited as many people as we could think of. The more people that were there, the more fun it would be. @ORGANIZATION1 and I did all the shopping the day before. We got lots of yummy stuff to make. After we got home from shopping we had to load all the bikes in the toy hauler. We each took two bikes, and we took @ORGANIZATION1's boyfriends bikes over so he could just drive over after work. We were up almost all night packing, trying to figure out the perfect outfits to wear each day. It was going to be a nice weekend at the coast, we could already tell. It was the middle of @DATE3, the sun was shining and it was beautiful outside. The next morning we got up and double checked everything to make sure we had the most important things like flags, helmets, clothes, and those sorts of things. Then it was off to get gas and finally head to the coast! Once we got on the road the music was blaring and the windows were down, just like always. The trip there seemed to take forever because we were so excited to get there. When we finally did get there, there was a really cute guy setting up his tent in one of our camp sights. I asked @ORGANIZATION1 who he was and @CAPS2 told me it was @CAPS1 (her boyfriend) best friend, @PERSON1. We parked the toy hauler and got out to unload and he came over to help. The second I layed my eyes on him, I knew he had to be mine. In the next hour or so we got all unloaded and set up. By then many more people had shown up.We helped everyone else get all their things unpacked and set up so we could go on a ride. Our first trip out on the sand was absolutely perfect. It was warm enough to ride in t-shirts. We didn't stay out for long though. People started to get hungry so we went back to camp, made dinner and sat around the fire. There was probably twenty or so of us sitting around the fire, talking about everything from the stars in the sky, to the sand on the ground. Every time I would look up I noticed that @PERSON1 was looking at me. He would just smile, and look away like it was nothing at all. As usual, @ORGANIZATION1 started telling us about a funny incident that had happened to her in the @DATE1 ( @CAPS2 was such a klutz.)We all started laughing as @CAPS2 was showing us her bruises from falling down the stairs. @PERSON1 and i locked eyes.  Later that night @PERSON1 asked me if I wanted to go on a walk. We walked all the way on the sand trail out to the dunes, and all the way to the top of a giant dune called @CAPS3 @CAPS4. When we got to the top we sat there, staring at the stars, talking. We realized we had lots of things in common. We liked to do all the same things, and we had the ability to make each other laugh.   Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. If you can make someone laugh, it means a lot. No one has ever been able to make me laugh the way that he does. I never knew that laughing could bring two people together the way that it did that one night at the dunes.."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21310	8	" I believe that laughter and joy are key elements that bring families and friends together. Being able to be in the company of those who make you laugh, is a greatly valued thing. Sometimes just sitting around and telling old stories, or playing board games can leave you with a sore gut because you have been laughing so hard. Many people these days have become so caught up in their lives and sometimes forget to take a moment and just laugh. I feel sorry for these people because they are missing out on the joy and enlightenment they could be sharing with the people around them. Family vacations are always chaotic, at least in my family, but they always turn out to be a memorable experience one way or another. Every winter our family gets together and goes to @ORGANIZATION1 to stay in our cabin there. A long weekend full of good food, trips to the mountain, snowball fights and family games, is a great environment to spark some laughter. Every year we bring big family games such as @LOCATION2, @CAPS1 and @LOCATION1. My family members and I tend to be very competitive people and the volume of the room in which the game is being played, tends to escalate almost through the roof. The whole house is filled with laughter and funny arguments over things like ""how in the world is that a picture of a sock!"" or ""That's not fair, you know the actual definition!"" I enjoy these times because they are memories that you can hold onto forever. Laughter is a part of happiness, and happiness needs to be a part of life. Spending time with those who make you laugh, are those that are worthy of your time. Wiser people than myself say that ""life is short."" I'm starting to realize that this statement is true. If life is short, then that time should be spent in the best way it can be; moments filled with laughter. "	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21312	8	" My boyfriend and I planned to go to the @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 fair that they put in @LOCATION1, OR. He asked my mom if she would let me go with him to the fair @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 and surprisingly my mom said ""yeah you can go"" i was really exited cause that would be our first @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 together. We were thinking of how it would be and we laughed because we were saying ""what if we were on a ride and we fell out,"" but knowing it wouldn't really happen. The day before @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 i got all my things ready for that day. i was really exited and nervous cause I've never been on rides like that so i probably didn't go to sleep till @NUM4 in the @TIME1.  @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was on a @DATE1, I didn't wanna go to school so my mom let me go to the fair instead of school. I woke up laughing and with a smile on my face because of all the things that were going through my head. I got ready, my boyfriend @PERSON1 his brother and his sister came to pick me and my friend up around @TIME3. We drove to the @CAPS9 station, parked and got our bus fare. After we got on the @CAPS9, we took a seat and we were taking pictures and making jokes. Since we got in the @CAPS9 it their was nothing but laughter. I'm pretty sure the rest of the passengers thought we were crazy. It took about @NUM6 minutes to get to were the fair was at, when we got off the @CAPS9. We ran to the gates to get our tickets. But it wasn't @NUM7 so they weren't opened so we had to wait @NUM8 minutes till they opened the gates. Once we got in this lady was selling a card that had the tokens in it, so we bought it and got on a spider ride which at first didn't look as scary but it moved really fast so i was sliding everywhere. @PERSON1 and his brother were laughing at me and my friend @ORGANIZATION2 cause we were yelling but after a couple of seconds i stopped yelling and i ended up laughing for no reason i just laughed and laughed until i finally stopped and we got off. After that ride i wasn't really in the mood of yelling or looking dumb in front of the other people that were at the fair so we didn't get on any for a while until we saw the @ORGANIZATION3 wheel we got on it. It was fun but it moved a lot so it reminded me of what @PERSON1 and I were talking about ""that how funny would it be if we fell out."" so i held the pole that was in the middle and @PERSON1 and them started to laugh so i let go and started laughing to cause the were making weird faces at me. When the ride was over we got off and went to go get something to eat from a tent that they had at the fair that was selling food, drinks and a lot of other things. We all bought a big bean and cheese burrito, @ORGANIZATION1, churros and an elephant ear. It was so good we wanted to buy more but we didn't have enough money. So we bought another elephant ear and I was the only one that actually ate all of it. So they started laughing because they we saying ""if you could eat two big elephant ears you could probably eat an entire elephant"" I laughed with then then said ""I bet I could, I'm just playing but these elephant ears are really good so I would eat twenty elephant ears"" they laughed and laughed so i just laughed with them as well. After I got done eating, we walked around the fair looking at the other tents they had. Their was a tent that spray painted your name or whatever you wanted on the shirt or sweater. But the bad thing was that we didn't have enough money for the sweater or for the rides so we just choose to go on all the rides and if we had left over money we would go back to buy a sweater. Then we pasted by a photo booth were they took a picture of you dressed up as if you were a pilgrim. I thought it was funny so i started laughing and my friends started to laugh as well because they didn't know what i was laughing about until i told them. Then they started laughing even more. We got on the last four rides and it was about @TIME2 we had to leave so we left waited for the @CAPS9. As we were waiting for the @CAPS9 two security guys come on their two horses and I thought its weird seeing horses in the city, we started to laugh. We got on the @CAPS9, took some pictures and went home."	15	17		32				3	3	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	3	3	3						
21319	8	" The snow shimmered in the sunlight like sequins. @CAPS1 and I rushed to her bedroom window to get a better look. A blanket of white covered the ground. Quickly we strapped ourselves into air-restricting snowsuits. She opened the wooden front door and the chilly air stung my nose. @CAPS6 we hurried out into any @NUM1 graders paradise. @CAPS1 and I had both been through some rough times in the past few months. I shielded myself from the fact that recently my muscular brown horse was put to death by a giant bolt of light and a loud thunder clap. @CAPS1 had just learned her parents were getting a divorce. Being best friends, we had been through a trail of tears that year, but all was forgotten when our legs hit the cold wet snow. We raced to her garage in panic to find sleds. As we ran through the house to the back door we were stopped by @CAPS1's short tan mom. She refused to let us go outside until we ate breakfast. We chomped down a bowl of the always tasty @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and gulped down a tall glass of juice. @CAPS6 we flew out the back door with our sleds. There the giant hill waited for us. It slopped downward in a perfect @NUM2 degree angle with only a few turns. The wood piles and thorny blackberry bushes that lined our sledding course taunted us. As my eyes wandered down the path of snow I heard @CAPS1 yell, ""@CAPS5!"" @CAPS6 I saw her whipping her way down the slope. I grabbed my red racer sled and took off after her. I approached my first turn. It hooked around left like the start of a figure eight. With ease I glided around the corner and saw a snapshot of the woodpile that sat on my right. I looked up to see the old pond at the bottom of the hill. The sun shone through slivers of the trees surrounding it like moonlight dancing on ice.  Confidently I approached my second turn. I spun around the corner sharply. I stared up ahead to see @CAPS1's bright blue sled reaching the finish line. That was when my eyes caught a glimpse of her neighbors bay horse and all my happiness floated away. As I got lost in my thoughts about @LOCATION1, I also lost focus. My shoulders hit the snow as if it were concrete. My legs tangled into knots and I could feel my head pounding. The sled had abandoned me. I tumbled down the hill like an avalanche. Eventually, the kind hands of a blackberry bush reached out to stop me. The thorns stabbed my neck. Carefully, I plucked each thorn from my neck and retreated to the bottom of the hill by foot.  By the time I reached my final destination, @CAPS1 couldn't breath. With her head buried in the snow, her abs were bouncing up and down with the rhythm of her laugh. She looked up at me, her bright green eyes and flushed pink cheeks told me how silly I had looked tumbling down the hill. She started to laugh one last time when a giant snot bubble burst out of her nostril. She started to crack up and I fell to the ground in a burst of laughter. I couldn't look at her anymore. Every time I glanced in her direction it became even more funny. I nudged my head into the snow just as she had done earlier. Finally when we had ourselves under control we looked up at each other. Our mascara was smeared around our eyes and down our cheeks. We resembled either clowns with a horrible makeup job or strange looking raccoons. Our laughs started to grow again, but quickly died down. Together we stood up. We spotted my bright red sled down by the frozen pond. ""@CAPS9 like a nice hike,"" I said. @CAPS6 we both started on our journey through the forest to retrieve it.  When I came shooting down the hill like a meteor, and she shot that snot bubble out of her nose like a rocket ship, I forgot everything. It was the first time in months that both of us felt at ease with our hardships. Laughter is the biggest connection we have with each other. When I laughed, my mind shut out the whole world. On snow days we now laugh to remember that cold @DATE2 day, but on that @DATE1 day we were laughing to forget.  "	23	23		46				5	5	5	5	5	4	5	5	5	5	5	4						
21321	8	" My friends and I have a relationship that can not be matched. We do everything together and we always have each others back. A key element in our relationship is laughter. If we did not laugh with and at each other, we would most likely be at each others throats. We do many things that turn out in raging laughter, but there was one particular event that occurred that did not seem humorous at first, but as the event came to an end it quickly became humorous.  The story starts at @TIME1 as i arrived at the school to depart on a grueling five hour bus ride to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for a wrestling tournament the following day. I slept for a solid @TIME1 hours before being awoken by my coach screaming at someone for spilling soda on the bus. We were almost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 so i just turned on my @CAPS5 and listened to music the rest of the way. When we finally arrived at our @CAPS13, we were instructed to go work off some extra weight before we could eat dinner.   After we had finished working out, we set off to get some dinner that way long overdue at this point. I was with my best friends, @CAPS6 and @CAPS7, both with appetites as big as mine. We past many fast food restaurants, but we did not want any old burger, we wanted the masterpiece that is called a @ORGANIZATION1. We had heard rumor that there was a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS8 establishment somewhere in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, so we set out on our journey to @ORGANIZATION1.We walked a good two miles along a highway, and took a few random alleys that we thought were shortcuts. I started to feel like we should go back and search more around the @CAPS13, but against my better judgment we trudged forward towards where we thought the marvelous @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was.   We soon found ourselves in an unknown part of town. We walked as quickly as possible to avoid the awkward stares from the people outside of their houses and the people roaming the streets. We tried to crack jokes to lighten the mood and to help ease the pain of realizing that we were tragically lost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Stupidly, we all forgot our cell phones back at our @CAPS13 so we had no way to call for help. We started walking back the way we thought we had come, but all we saw were more old, weathered houses and buildings that were completely unfamiliar. We were all scared, but we masked our fears in hopes of not starting a state of panic.  We were all guessing that is was about nine-thirty, and we had to be back before ten to go to bed. This sent us into a panic more that anything. Our minds filled with images of our coach screaming at us with all his might, then making us run an agonizing five miles. We started frantically running down streets and alleys in hopes of seeing a familiar scene. After not seeing anything, and running for about ten minutes, we regrouped and continued walking. The fear that was once masked, was now clearly visible in all of our faces.   We came upon a digital billboard that displayed the time, and temperature. We only had ten minutes to make it back to our @CAPS13 or our fate was sealed. We began running again praying that we would arrive back on time. As we ran, we came upon the side of a big @CAPS13. We did not know the name of the @CAPS13 we were staying at, so we decided to ask the person inside if they knew where it could be. The lady at the front counter informed us that were were now at the @CAPS13 @NUM1, but she had just started her shift and did not know where we could be. As we thanked her and walked out the door, we were greeted with a strong slap to the head. we turned in shock to see our coach, red at a beat, pointing at his watch. We had almost made it, only @TIME1 minutes late.   after being screamed at for a solid twenty minutes, he sent us up to our room to sleep for the long day ahead of us. I was about to crawl in bed when i glanced out the bedroom window and saw what my heart so deeply longed for; the marvelous @ORGANIZATION1. My friends and I immediately broke into hysterical laughter. We had gotten lost searching for the treasure that is @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, and it turned out the treasure was in our own back yard. We hardly got any sleep that night due to all of the ironic laughter and the thoughts of what had just taken place. I never got to sink my teeth into one of those tasty, succulent @ORGANIZATION1, but we did have a very funny and ironic experience that still makes me laugh to this very moment."	20	18	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4
21352	8	"                   The @CAPS1 of The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I was @NUM1 years old, and I lived on a farm out side of @LOCATION1 OR. I spent most my time playing with my brothers, @PERSON1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. We did everything together, from caching frogs to eating bugs. We had just moved to a new house, and my dad had a lot of stuff to do to make it a safe and fun environment. His first thing he had to do, was to build a pull @CAPS3, which is a building on top of a garage. He started by poring cement on to the freshly bulldozed land. He made square holes in the cement to put the poles in, so it would hold the @CAPS3 up. Then he started to make the main building on top of the garage he made. I was so exited to see my dad building this @CAPS3 with his bare hands. Once he made the whole inside safe i was let in. I walked in and was amazed by how beautiful it was, and how perfectly built it was. But there was still stuff to do. My dad and my oldest brother @PERSON2 were putting the shingles on, so the rain and other crap could not get in. The next day I woke up to them hooting and hollering, like a bunch of chickens when they lay their first egg. They just finished the pull @CAPS3. I sprung to my feet like a cat that just got shot by an air-soft gun, and ran down stairs to meet them. When they came in, it looked like they fell in a pond. They were soaked in sweat. Right away my brothers and I ran as fast as we could to the brand new @CAPS2 @CAPS3. When we entered the @CAPS3, we felt a weird sensation, like if something just got cold and wet on our feet. Then we know what we had just done, we had just ran on the freshly painted floor. We all looked at each other and started trying to find away back with making the least mess. We walked backwards in our previous foot prints. When we finally reached the stairs, we had to find a way to cover our mess we had just made, or else we would be in a lot of trouble. So we all came up with a plan, it was to paint over our foot prints with the left over paint. So right away we started to paint over our mess we had made, with the left over paint we found from the project. Soon we were all done, and it was a great relief that we would not get cot.  Later that day my dad and older brother went to the @CAPS3 to see if the paint had dried. to their surprise they sow a bunch of little foot prints on the stairs leading to the freshly painted floor. As they went up the stairs they kept seen more and more foot prints. Ones they reached the top they looked at the wet floor and they only sow wet paint, no foot prints. As all this is happening my brothers and i were watching from our window, we could see everything. Soon we sow them coming back so we went down to meet them. As they walked in i could see a puzzled look on there face, it was a look of confusion. They entered the door and looked right at me, it was like if i just stole a hundred dollars and just got cot. My dad politely said ""can i see your feet?"" ""@CAPS6"" i replied with a scared face. I showed him my feet and then he said ""did you perhaps go in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, then try to fix your mess by painting over it?"" I looked at him with a dumb face and said ""@CAPS6"". He just had a great big smile and said, ""go wash your feet"". Later that day the floor dried and we all went up there and ate dinner."	17	20		37				3	4	3	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21354	8	" i woke up at @NUM1 from a cal from my cousin saying he wanted to hang out and introduce me to my cousin i have never met before. after we got off the phone i hung up and scurried into the shower and got ready as fast as i could. once they got to my house i frantically ran to the door and opened it really fast expecting some kind of reaction from my new cousin, but the one i got wasn't what i expected. right when i opened the door he began cracking up laughing at my for a couple of minutes. i got kinda mad at him because i didn't know what he was laughing at , until i looked down and realized i had no pants on, i rushed back into my room and put some shorts on and came back into the living room while they were still on the coach laughing at my stupid mistake. i sat down on the couch across from them and asked them what they were laughing about and that i did it on purpose for a joke, they didn't believe me at all, i don't blame them because that was the stupidest thing to say in that circumstance.    after they stopped laughing my cousin asked me if that was the only thing iv done like that,i replied no, and he started on about some stories about him doing dumb stuff like i did, that ended up being the only topic we talked about for half the day, just reciting dumb stories about ourselves that were embarrassing. it turns out that just because i made that dumb mistake it made it easy for us to get along and start talking as soon as he walked in and just for that reason we have had a good relationship since we met .in the end i was glad i did that because it made us really close because we can now just laugh at each other when either of us do stupid stuff. and that's my story in which laughter was an element in a relationship between my cousin and i."	17	18		35				4	3	3	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
21361	8	"                                   @DATE2 I woke up on a very beautiful day. The sky was clear and the sun was shining, which was unusual for a day in @DATE1. I got out of bed, as I usually do. I ate my breakfast, went to the bathroom, and brushed my teeth. I left the house feeling a bit tired but great. As I walked to my bus stop, I watched people go by, saying @CAPS4 every now and then. When I got to my bus stop, @CAPS5 one was there. I thought that maybe the bus had already come and picked the kids up.  I waited and waited. Almost fifteen minutes went by. I was starting to get worried. If I had missed the bus, I couldn't go to @ORGANIZATION1. My parents worked until the @TIME1 and there was @CAPS5 one to drive me there. I then decided to walk to the next stop. @CAPS5 one was there either. By that time, I was sure that the bus had come earlier and left me behind. I started to walk back to my house. When I got there, I opened the door and went to check the @ORGANIZATION1 calender hanging on the wall. There was nothing written on @DATE3. @CAPS7 was a normal @ORGANIZATION1 day.  @CAPS2 could I have missed the bus? I never miss the bus! I started to ask myself of other possibilities. Maybe there were weather problems and the schools got closed. That wasn't possible because the weather was great. Maybe something happened to the bus, like an accident and @CAPS7 couldn't come, but that wasn't @CAPS7 either because then the kids would have been at their bus stops. The more I thought about @CAPS7, the less @CAPS7 made sense to me. What was going on that day? I got frustrated. I set my backpack down so that I could look for my daily planner. I opened @CAPS7 up and searched for the @ORGANIZATION1's phone number. Then, I took the phone and called the @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS1've reached @ORGANIZATION1,"" a woman on the phone said. "" @CAPS2 @MONTH1 I help @CAPS1?"" ""@CAPS3, I'm a student there and I was wondering if something was wrong because I didn't see the bus today?"" I said. There was a moment of silence. The woman didn't answer me. This was making me angry. ""@CAPS4, are @CAPS1 still there?"" I asked, with anger showing through my voice. Nothing. Then, the woman started laughing. @CAPS8 laughed for almost a minute. This had made me mad. What had I said that would make her laugh like that? ""Was @CAPS7 something that I said?"" I asked. ""@CAPS5, @CAPS5, I'm so sorry,"" @CAPS8 said, trying to keep herself from laughing. "" @CAPS5, @CAPS7's just that, do @CAPS1 know what day is today?"" ""@CAPS7's @DATE3, isn't @CAPS7?"" @CAPS8 laughed again. ""@CAPS5, today isn't @DATE3, @CAPS7's @DATE2."" I was shocked to hear that. I had spent all of my time trying to figure out what had happened. The only possibility that I hadn't thought of was that @CAPS7 was @DATE2. I felt like an idiot. I set down the phone and started to laugh. I laughed and laughed like I hadn't in years."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
21364	8	"                                           ""Laughter"" Laughter is a very big part of my life. I love to laugh, whether it is about something, at something, about someone, at someone, a funny event, a funny face, or just a funny joke. I heard once that the more you laugh the longer you live; if that is true I'm gonna live forever. I'm going to tell you a story about laughter because it is a big part of my life.  I laugh the most when I am with my family and friends. They are all very funny people that are cracking jokes any chance they get. There hasn't been one family gathering or friend hangout where I didn't laugh. A very funny moment in my life that I will never forget is the time my sister and I were starting to get to know our new step-mom, @CAPS1.We were all playing this game where one person throws a football into a group of people, and whoever catches it gets the amount of points the thrower calls out. We were all getting points left and right; however, @CAPS1 wasn't doing so hot. She came up with a plan that she said would make her win. Actually, it just ended with all of us on the floor crying from laughing so hard. I had thrown the ball and called out ""@NUM1 points!"" @CAPS1 turned around. My eyes opened wide. Shayna screamed in laughter as @CAPS1 had pulled down her pants to moon us. The foot ball hits the grass, as do all of us.We laughed until our stomachs ached and our eyes watered. I really think that moment brought all of us closer together. I believe laughter brings everyone closer together.  My boyfriend and I are very close because we laugh all the time; it is a very big part of our relationship. Just think for a minute. All the emotions that we humans have and deal with on a regular basis, which one is truly universal? We can love, cry, feel hate and disrespect. Most of us have sympathy and empathy, but the one true feeling we humans share with and between another person is a smile along with laughter. If you can give a person a reason to laugh, then you have connected and made a mile into an inch. It's even bigger than that. The internet has provided us in ways to reachout through laughter. Not just in miles, but in counties. You-tube is a social network of laughter. I have put many funny videos on you-tube and watched many that made me laugh. One day I made this video of my friends and I playing @CAPS5. It was so funny I thought I would put it on you-tube. I shared it with my mom who laughed very hard. She shared it with family who shared it with co workers who shared it with there family and friends.They all laughed.Laughter is all around. Laughter can start in one place like @PERSON1 and reach out all the way to @LOCATION1.  Laughter also isn't always a good thing. People can go from laughing at a funny joke to laughing and making fun of a kid on the play ground. Laughter doesn't always feel good, if you're the one being laughed at. I don't like to think of laughed that way. I like to remember all the times I laughed and shared that special moment with a loved one.  Laughter is in my everyday schedule. I would have to write a book in order to tell you all the times that laughter was one element in my life because it happens every day. I enjoy laughter. I hope you do,too."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
21369	8	" Laughter is the key I think that being happy is a big part in life because, being happy feels so good. If I was in a relation ship that was not happy I would not like it at all. In a happy relationship comes laughter,the first thing I do wen I meet someone I always smiling and telling jokes because if I tell jokes and they are laughing they know that I am a happy person. If you meet any person weather it is a grown up to a friend to a person you want to go out with they will always enjoy laughter. Lets just say me and my girlfriend when I first saw her she was sitting in a desk in my history class crying and I asked if she is okay and she told me her story after she told me her story I told her how it feel and then I told her a joke and she laughed.After she got done laughing she ask me for my phone number and then that night we started dating. I asked her what she likes about me and she said the way I make her laugh.  I always love to make my family and friends laugh because if they smile it makes me smile. I use laughter as a way to make people feel better about themselves and my self. If the world can learn to laugh and be happy it would be a better place because I rather laugh and be happy then be mad or sad about something. when I was growing up I was by myself all the time so i had to learn how to keep myself happy so I would think about funny stuff I have seen or said in the past and try to make a story about it and it worked.When I got older i started doing stand up comedy. It made me feel so good seeing all the people laugh. then after the show seeing all the people walk out with big smiles on there faces it was a night I will never forget that night.If i had to pick what I wold want to do for fun I wold be a comedian.Thank you for reading this and have a nice day"	15	14		29				3	3	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	3						
21370	8	" My smile is a mask. It disguises all the past trageties, future mishaps, and current mistakes--loss. Life is a puzzle i can not figure out. I am lost, and I am losing myself the more I pounce into life. Isolate myself from the world, sleep in a bed of tear soaked tissues, and stare at my face in the mirror that I despise so much. Laughter or even just a smile goes a long way--to long. It sends the wrong message to those who can not tell if the mask is real, or perfectively put on. That is the message I want to give, right? Pretty soon, my laughter diminishes, my smile lowers, and my lips began to quiver. It feels as though my heart is bleeding, and being squeezed at the same time. The eyes are becoming moist, they began to sting, and reden as if infected. Do not ask me if I am okay, ask to do anything for me, or hug me. Only pushing me to breakdown, which is something that is unexceptable. Peace, is the only thing needed at the moment; and of course, my best friend, tissue."	16	15		31				3	3	3	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21379	8	"  It was @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 of @DATE1, the sun was shining and the birds were chirping. It was a great @ORGANIZATION1 to be outside doing something unique to enjoy the nice weather. There was a parade in @LOCATION1, the parade that I was in. I loved being the center of attention, I loved to be seen; and whats a better way for that to happen then being in a parade? I was with my best friend @PERSON2 and her family. There float was for @ORGANIZATION1. Which is the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 that they had owned at the time.   We had a lot of children on the float, probably about twenty. With only @PERSON2, @PERSON2's mom, and the manager of the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 to help watch the kids. The children were dressed up in animal costumes. The older kids were passing out candy while the toddlers were on the float.   @PERSON2 and I were laughing the whole time, I had almost forgotten that there were hundreds of people watching us. We were carrying the two twin baby's. I cant remember their names. We switched off a few times but for the most part I was holding the boy while she was holding the girl. They were well behaved baby's, they didn't cry often unless we had laughed to hard. Or yelled at the crowd too loudly.  We passed a bunch of people that we knew. I had seen my cousins, and a few aunts and uncles. I could only wave at them because the parade was moving oddly fast. After a while @PERSON2 and I had started to get tired from holding the baby's and walking around. So we stood at the front of the float and leaned against the wooden rail. The rail was only nailed in so it wasn't very sturdy. We figured that it would be fine though.   The parade continued we started to become even more tired and hot from the sun. We felt like we could have fallen asleep right there in front of everyone. We leaned more and more against the rail from exhaustion. We were still laughing and having a good time, but we became more and more relaxed and ended up with all of our weight pushing against the rail.   Next thing we knew the rail had broken and we fell. There was a bunch of people watching and we were still holding the baby's. At the time I was holding the girl and @PERSON2 was holding the boy. The boy had just fallen to sleep. The baby's were fine but the boy started to cry, he wasn't hurt he was just shocked. It was the most embarrassing moment that we had ever had.  The crowd started to laugh at us and our faces got beat red. Baileys mom came over to us to make sure we were all okay. She handed the baby's off to the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 manager who was there. Then @PERSON2's mom helped us up. Then we all burst into laughter. Not only was it the most embarrassing moment of our lives, but it was the funniest moment as well. Our butts were sore so we walked funny for the rest of the parade. One time @PERSON2 even stood up on the float and she went to lean against the rail again until she had realized that it wasn't there anymore.  At the end of the parade @PERSON2's family stood there waiting for us. Uncle marks kids, @PERSON1 and @PERSON3, came up and laughed at us and made fun. Papa @PERSON4 had asked if we were okay. When he asked that @PERSON2 and I looked at each other and burst into laughter again. Papa just looked puzzled and then joined in our laughter. He was glad that we had just laughed the embarrassment off. Then we went home after that.  That @ORGANIZATION1 was a good @ORGANIZATION1 for us. We went home and talked about what had happened. We both realized that if we wouldn't have laughed at our selves then we would have probably ended up crying of embarrassment. We realized that when something bad happens its best to look at the bright side, make a joke out of it, or just laugh at yourself. @PERSON2 and I have made a fool of our selves many times ever sense, and laughing at our selves had made us much closer.   Every relationship whether its intimate, family, or just friendship needs laughter; or else the tough things in life will bring you down. Laughing is what keeps you bold, and strong. If something embarrassing happens and you don't laugh about it that embarrassing moment can stick with you forever, and it will effect you in the long run. If you were to never laugh in a relationship, then it wouldn't be a relationship at all. That's why laughing is very important in everybody's lives."	18	17		35				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	3	3						
21382	8	" Have you ever had a friend who when your with them you seem to be able to do nothing but laugh? I have, his name is @PERSON1. Together, him and I do nothing but spend countless hours making jokes, smiling, and enjoying ourselves. In any relationship, or friendship, laughter is an important quality. In the next few paragraphs I will explain why laughter is so important, and how it made his and our friendship so strong and compatible. To begin with, @PERSON1 is my closest friend. We both are very fun and outgoing people. We tend to put tense situations at ease by our sense of humors. This is important because without laughter you don't enjoy things as much. Someone once told me ""for every minute you laugh, it adds a year to your life."" That is important because nobody wants to live a short miserable life. Together we make the @CAPS7 of the worst situations and move on from them. Laughing is something that no one can live without. It is one of those things can make the biggest change in someones life, whether that be in a good way, or even in a bad way. Laughter in our relationship is like glue. When things between us ever got rough, or just things in general got hard, we made it a point to make a joke out of it and try to forget what was wrong. One of the ways our sense of humor came in handy was when we found out he was getting deployed. If you have never been through that before, let me tell you, it's hard. I remember everything about that day, I was outside fixing our fence when i got a call from @CAPS1. When I answered his voice was timid and shaken, I had never heard him sound like that before. He then told me that he was going to come over and that he had something he needed to tell me. At first i wasn't too concerned because he has a tendency to joke around and almost never be serious, this time I was wrong. Within twenty minutes I could hear the roar of his red diesel pulling in our driveway. When he got to the door, instead of just walking in like normal, he knocked. To my surprise, as he peeked his head in, his face was as red as a cherry, eyes swollen and watering, and his voice quivering with sadness. I knew then that this was serious. After a miserable three hours of sobbing and hugs he explained to me that he would be leaving in four days to @LOCATION1. Taking all that in at once was hard. I knew he was in the army but I guess I just never thought that day would come. Finally we began talking more and more about it the exact details. We then started to @ORGANIZATION1 things that he could find there that would remind him of home. This turned into a day of jokes. Our first mission was to find a @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2, fail. Our second mission, @CAPS3-@CAPS4, another fail. And finally our third mission, was to find anything that reminded him of me. We came to the conclusion our @CAPS7 idea would be @CAPS5 @CAPS6. In return we got in his truck ad drove to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 and purchased two high-tech @CAPS5 cams, and went home to set them up. That in itself was a memory I will never forget.  When the day finally came to an end we realized that yes it would be hard for us, but we would not let that break us down. We then spent the next four days doing things he convinced himself ""he @MONTH1 never get to do again."" We spent hours playing @CAPS9-box, hours playing football in the yard, and even hours playing in a park swinging and sliding. The reality of it is, without laughter and fun, we would have most likely not have been able to deal with it. To this day we still plan a specific time, and ""@CAPS6 it up"" together.  In conclusion, although things get tough and overbearing, there is always an escape. That escape for me and my @CAPS7 friend is laughter. When worse comes to worst, turn your favorite cartoon on, call the person who can always make you laugh, spend hours doing pointless, yet fun things, enjoy what you have at your fingertips, and laugh, you @MONTH1 never know when those things can up and walk away."	22	20		42				5	4	5	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21386	8	" During the @DATE1 of the sixth grade @CAPS4 parents decided they were getting a divorce. I got the phone call when I was at @CAPS4 best friend @PERSON1's house.   ""@CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 father"" @CAPS4 @CAPS5 said through the phone to me.   ""@CAPS6 @CAPS5, @CAPS8's @CAPS9?"" I asked him.   ""@CAPS10 need to come home, @CAPS10 @CAPS18 has served me today with divorce papers."" @CAPS12 told me. I could feel the tears starting to swell @CAPS9 in @CAPS4 eyes. I had no clue @CAPS8 was happening, I was only @NUM1 and vaguely knew @CAPS8 divorce was. Without saying a word to him, I hung @CAPS9 the phone and ran into @PERSON1's room. I knew that the divorce would change things for me, but I didn't realize to @CAPS8 extent.   I stayed at @LOCATION1's house for the next two weeks. There was no way I was going home. I didn't want to see @CAPS4 @CAPS18 or @CAPS4 father. At night I drempt about @CAPS8 @CAPS4 sisters were going through, the horror that they had to endure while I was away. I wondered @CAPS8 @CAPS4 father was doing, where @CAPS4 @CAPS18 was, and whether or not @CAPS4 sisters were @CAPS13. Even though I knew I should have gone home at one point during those two weeks, I didn't.  During those two weeks at @LOCATION1's house, I felt safe and secure, but not once did I feel happy. It was an emotion that I had longed for, but all the times that I tried to smile, tried to laugh, tried to be myself, I couldn't. I knew that something had changed in me when I hung @CAPS9 the phone on @CAPS4 father. I had never hung @CAPS9 on anyone before. It was something that I knew I shouldn't have done, but I was so upset, I did it anyways.  When @CAPS4 @CAPS18 came to pick me @CAPS9 after @CAPS4 two week extended stay at @LOCATION1's, she looked at me with concern in her eyes. I had never seen this emotion in @CAPS4 @CAPS18 before. She usually was so calm and in control. I had never seen her so concerned or upset. I knew that she was concerned for me. I also knew that @PERSON1's @CAPS14 had called mine several times during @CAPS4 stay. I assume she told her about how I was acting, but @CAPS8 was I supposed to do? @CAPS4 parents were splitting @CAPS9! @CAPS4 whole life was being flushed down the toilet. I knew that nothing would ever be the same and it killed me inside.  No one spoke on the ride home. I could feel the tension building as we turned onto @CAPS4 street and drove towards @CAPS4 house. When we pulled into the driveway, I got out of the car and ran to @CAPS4 room, leaving @CAPS4 things on the back seat of the sedan. For two days, I didn't eat or sleep. I just laid in @CAPS4 bed longing for @CAPS4 father to come home. I had never gone to bed without @CAPS4 father tucking me in, never woke @CAPS9 in the @TIME1 on @CAPS4 own. There were so many things that @CAPS4 father did that @CAPS12 wasn't there to do anymore.  Things didn't start to get better until @CAPS4 @CAPS18 sent me and @CAPS4 sisters to @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house in @LOCATION2. I don't know why, but when I was there, I felt that same sense of safeness and security that I felt when I was at @LOCATION1's house. Even though I felt safe and secure, it still wasn't the same. It had been several weeks since I had visited @PERSON1, and I was dying to go back to her house. I knew that that was the only place that I could actually recover from @CAPS8 was happening. @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house was nice and all, but it didn't feel like home, I didn't think that anywhere I stayed would feel right. All I knew is that I needed @CAPS4 @CAPS5, not @CAPS4 @CAPS17 or @CAPS4 @CAPS18, just @CAPS4 @CAPS5, and maybe @PERSON1.  When I came home from @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house, I made arrangements to go over to @LOCATION1 house. I knew that I would be staying awhile, so I packed extra. When I got there, I told her about @CAPS8 was going on and how @CAPS4 sisters were doing. On the night that I arrived, we decided that we would go to the river the next day. I thought it was an alright idea. The next day we went to the river, her brothers decided to join us. Her brother @PERSON2 wanted to prove to us how much of a man @CAPS12 was, so @CAPS12 jumped off of the largest rock at the river. I thought it would be a perfect cannon ball, but it wasn't. @CAPS12 landed on his stomach for the perfect belly flop. I couldn't contain myself, I burst out laughing, I don't think i stopped laughing for several minutes. It was by far the best day I had since the day @CAPS4 father called me at @LOCATION1's house."	21	19	42	42				4	5	5	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	4	4	4
21393	8	" Imagine this, flying past trees on a @CAPS1 @NUM1, four wheeler trying to keep up with everybody that's in front of you. That is how it was on new years eve.  We headed out from the house at about @NUM2 o'clock pm. When we left the house we headed for one of our friends house because we asked them earlier if they wanted to go. So when we left we had to leave fast so we were not on the the road for a long time. When we got to our friends house we hung out for a little while then asked them if they still wanted to go on a ride with us. They got all ready then at about @NUM2:45 we all headed out. All together now there was about @TIME1 of us about to head up on gillhooly on this ride.  When we finally got to the top of the mountain it was about @NUM4 o'clock pm. So we just hung out until @NUM5 o'clock. When I say hangout I mean we hit some mud holes and played around a little bit. By the time we were all muddy it was about @NUM4:55 pm. So we set up some fireworks to shoot off. Then about @TIME1 we shot all of them off. There was only about @TIME1 or @NUM7 of them. We started to head back home at about @NUM8 in the @TIME2 but one of our friends got stuck in some snow off the side of the road. We spent about a half hour digging him out before we finally headed back home. We arrived back at the house at @NUM9 in the @TIME2. We all got something to eat because we were all hungry then we watched a little @CAPS2 then headed to bed for the night.  "	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3

Without smiles, @CAPS1 would be no affection. Without affection @CAPS1 would be no emotion. Without emotion, @CAPS1 would be no re-action. Without a re-action, everyone around you would be blank. Laughter; it can do so many things. It can bring people together or even tear people apart. It can be a way @CAPS2 express yourself, or even a way @CAPS2 put up ""your walls."" Laughter could mean so many different things. It can show so many different different things. It can show so many emotions, or even hide them. For example: @CAPS1's those people who laugh when they cry, when @CAPS1 mad, when @CAPS1 sad ect. But look beyond the picture why do you think @CAPS1 laughing at these times? When really that's not at all the emotion they are feeling. @CAPS1 not laughing because @CAPS1 all around a happy person. @CAPS1 laughing @CAPS2 hide the true pain they are feeling inside, because whether they like it or not no human can completely let ""it all on the line."" @CAPS2 be so vulnerable anyone could get in and cause pain. So how important is laughter @CAPS2 you? In and kind of relationship laughter is important. W heather it be a friendship, a marriage, an engagement ect. @CAPS2 know how your partner is feeling can make all the difference. So one laugh or giggle could make turn it all around. Laughter it's the shortest distance between two people."	15	10		25				3	3	3	3	3	3	2	2	2	2	2	2						
21413	8	" Laughter is the only characteristic a person could perfect. Laughter is the element that could bring a group of people into a tight bond of friends. Laughter is the ultimate answer to success and happiness in life, and this is what the story of mine demanded me to say about laughter. Many times my family of four departs to go camping during the @DATE1. Family friends enjoy coming along with us on these vacations. A couple summers ago while on a camping trip with my family and lots of friends, I experienced and learned what true, rich laughter could do that changed my life. Whether I learned from the telling of funny stories at campfire, playing little practical jokes on each other, or just some old friendly card games of hearts, I really began to realize what the these times had meant to me. My best gal friend and I were expecting these three boys to join us all week. When the time came that they should arrive my friend and I started plotting out our secret plan. It was the boys duty before they could go out to the lake and start boating, to set up their tent. They managed to make a @NUM1 minute task take two hours, bravo to them. The three lost boys were at the water now as they had finally finished and could stand not to be anywhere but the lake any longer. While they were down swimming my friend and I took their hard worked tent and ripped out the stakes to collapse it first, only to then turn it inside out second. What better way to welcome new comers then to start off things with a good sense of humor.  The boys however didn't think it was quite so funny, however by @TIME1 fall they had a plan rising within them that my friend nor I knew was coming for us. Wake up call rolled around at about four in the @TIME2 for us two girls in a non-sound proof tent. We had a very loud wake up call that sounded as if the ducks were in a war zone against each other. We found out later, that the ducks found sandwiches mysteriously placed in a direct circle all around our tent. It was game on after the boys pulled that prank. It's hard for guys to get you back, if they're stuck in a tent. A zip tie would do the job. In the middle of the @TIME1, sneakily crawl over and zip tie their zippers together. Just as my friend and I thought this was the perfect way to get the boys back, one of our co-partners went and told the guys our plan. The three amigos then wanted to turn around and do it to us first. The next @TIME2 my friend and I woke, we tried to climb out of the tent and that was a little hard to do. Our zippers were tied together and that's not so great of mix when you have us girls that really need to use the restroom. One of the boys had a pocket knife with him and he was playing like cat and mouse with us, barely letting the knife out of our reach. When I finally had hold of the small blade, I ripped open the zippers, gently tossed the knife to the ground and ran to the ladies room. When I got back to blood on the ground, I found that it wasn't as gentle of a toss as I thought it was. The same guy that gave us the knife to use, put his foot in the way of the ever so slightly tossed knife. Once he was home his mom took him to the hospital to get stitches. Campfire that @TIME1 was a hoot. Cards together was hilarious too because by the end we knew how each person was going to play, pretty much we knew who would win and who would come in dead @TIME1. Even with someone having a cut open foot we were on the ground rolling around because we're laughing so hard. My gal friend and I took off the make up and jeans, put on a baggy sweatshirt and up do with our hair and really just had a great time that @TIME1. It was the @TIME1 together there on the camping trip and it was nice to know we were having a good time laughing, with just being our self's and expressing without trying to impress. Later as we're all talking about these stories and jokes pulled on each other, we came to recognize that these are the kinds of moments people live for. Laughing brought us closer together, we weren't friends before and now after our times shared we're exceptionally close best friends. Our friend relationship with each other was brought into contact by laughing in harmony together, by the @TIME1 spent together, by harmless little jokes played on each other, by turning a camping trip in to something much more meaningful."	25	21		46				5	5	5	5	5	5	5	4	5	5	4	4						
21427	8	" Laughter helps in so many situations throughout life. When your angry, sad, nervous or even mourning. Laughing about the good times @CAPS1 had with an old friend, or realizing a situation isn't scary or sad but is really quite hilarious. Many times throughout my life when things happened that made me in someway or another upset, the people close to me always helped by making me laugh. Realizing whatever was happening was not as bad as I had thought. Which made me look on the positive and light-hearted side of things. A specific situation happened when I was about nine years old. In school most kids at some time or another say something hurtful or without thinking. While parents should teach their children better it seems to be in their nature to make thoughtless observations, some times hurting others by drawing attention to flaws. I was sitting in class working on an art project. There was three other kids at my group and we were talking about who knows what, it was so many years ago. But then on boy starts talking about weight and how he is so tough and muscular, and yes were all eight or nine years old but he thought he was being cool. So he turns to me and says ""@CAPS1 are not in shape, your fat"". This crushed me how was I suppose to reply to this. I tried to act as if it didn't bother me. I went on to finish my art project. I could not help but hear repeating in my head those evil words that stung me. My eyes started to tear up and soon a drop of water appeared on my paper, I could not hold back the tears. I was waiting for the bell to ring so I could get out if this terrible place and go home to people who were smarter then to say things like that boy did. As I got off the bus I was already feeling the emotions rising to the surface. Starting to bawl as my mom opened the door. She exclaimed ""@CAPS2 what's the matter, what happened?"" @CAPS3 tears I relayed the terrible scene. She felt bad for me and asked the boys name. I told her @PERSON1. She began to laugh and say ""That chubby kid with the buck teeth?, oh honey don't let that bother @CAPS1 he isn't in shape at all"". I started to laugh realizing he did have buck teeth. The tears stopped coming to my eyes and I really realized the whole situation. He was being thoughtless and bragging about himself, which the statement were not even true and I was not fat. Laughing made me feel better and realize how silly it all was. Laughter really did help me realize it wasn't so bad. I was still a little embarrassed but I was over it. Laughing also got my mind off of what @PERSON1 said to me. Of course even though he said a thoughtless comment to me, I would not have said a thoughtless commend about any of this flaws. But laughing about how he had buck teeth made me feel better. Laughing also made me see how I was making a big deal out of a little situation, also. "	17	18		35				4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
21433	8	" A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 was a warm @DATE1 @CAPS1, some of my friends and I had planned to spend a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the @CAPS3. We had decided on walking around and looking @CAPS2 all the cool stores. Eventually we would all get lunch and go out to the park near the river right next to the @CAPS3. We all agreed that @CAPS4 was a great plan and we would all have a wonderful @CAPS1. To start off, we all met @CAPS2 the bus stop by the movies. @PERSON3, @PERSON4, @PERSON2, @CAPS5 and I were all there. We decided to go look inside @CAPS6 @CAPS7 first because they have all the crazy things we love. Inside the store, I found a dress that was to die for. @CAPS4 was small and grey with skulls all over @CAPS4. Unfortunately, @CAPS4 costed @MONEY1 that i did not have, so we left @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Next, we went to @NUM1 @CAPS10 to see what they had in store for us. @PERSON3 and I created a black teddy @PERSON1 with a studded leather jacket. We gave @CAPS4 an awsome top hat and named @CAPS4 @CAPS11 @PERSON1. We all thought @CAPS4 was pretty funny because teddy bears are supposed to be cute and this one was kind of scary. We paid @MONEY2 for @CAPS4 and continued on our little adventure. We all decided @CAPS4 was about lunch time so we went and got chineese food from @ORGANIZATION1, left the @CAPS3, and headed down to the park next to the river. Before we got to the park, we stopped to go see what @CAPS4 was like under the bridge. There were towers of rocks all over the place, so we decided to build one of our own. We stacked @CAPS4 up almost as tall as me before @CAPS4 toppled over, almost crushing @PERSON4 on the way down. We followed the little path away from the rock towers down to the river. @CAPS4 lead us to a little beach next to the water. There was a huge pillar separating the trees and bushes from the water. We decided to eat lunch here instead of going to the park. After eating lunch, we were all full of energy again. @CAPS5 started a pine cone war by tagging me in the back of the head with one. After a few minutes, all of us were involved. We used the giant pillar from the bridge as a shield but @CAPS4 didn't quite work. @PERSON4, who had a better aim than all of us, was hitting everyone left and right, so the rest of us teamed up on him. We all threw pine cones one after the other untill @PERSON4 had to start backing away. As he reached the edge of the shore, he tripped over a big rock and fell backwards into the shallow water. Instantly, we all busted out in a roar of laughter that continued on for a good couple of minutes before @CAPS5 finally decided on helping @PERSON4 out of the water. He was very unhappy about the situation while we were all quite pleased. Jesica had managed to get a vidio of the whole thing and when we played @CAPS4 back to @PERSON4 he couldn't help but laugh with us. After that, we went to the park. Immediately, we all ran for the slide. ""I wanna go first!"" screamed @PERSON3 as we all made @CAPS4 up the jungle jim to the slide. All of us pushed and shoved to get to the slide before I finally suggested going down the big, swirly slide all together. Everyone els thought @CAPS4 was a great idea so we attempted @CAPS4. @PERSON3 was first, as she wanted, I was second, followed by @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and then @CAPS5. We started off realy slow and progressed in speed as more of us piled onto the slide. We ended in a pile @CAPS2 the bottom, all laughing histarically. When we all came back to reality we realized @CAPS4 was time to head home so we all grabbed our things and headed for the bus stop. In the end, @CAPS4 had turned out to be an even better @CAPS1 than we had expected. The whole @CAPS1 was full of joy and laughter, whitch are a few of the key aspects of life. Without laughter, there would be no way to @ORGANIZATION1 when you are extremely happy or when you think something is funny. Happiness is one thing you need to live a fun, fulfilling life. I feel like the ability to laugh is one thing that makes a person fun to have around. Do you think you laugh often enough?"	20	15		35				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21438	8	" Many people love to laugh and others just don't like it as much. I'm one of those people who love laughing and will laugh when my @CAPS1 tell a very good joke. I believe that it's important to laugh because it just feels good, it makes you feel that everything is going okay. With the people that you can laugh the most with are obviously your @CAPS1. When you are feeling down who is there to support you, your @CAPS1 are, and what they try to do is to make you laugh.       My best friend @PERSON3 and I have the tendency to always laugh, especially if we have a class together it's all about laughter. We have fun in class, we do pay attention but we just make it interesting and we just laugh so much that it can distract others. Our teacher from sophomore year @PERSON1 always told us that we're very giggly and that it was a good thing. She also told us that she had never seen anyone laugh so much in her class. For example that year we were studying vocabulary and when @PERSON3 and I saw the word countenance we started laughing so much because it means the face and it reminded us about the tv show @CAPS1. Every time that word came up during that week we would laugh so hard that our stomachs started to hurt. Her face would turn as red as a tomato and I just couldn't even say a word. Even now that we're juniors we still remember that and we just start laughing so hard that it gets to the point that if I'm standing up I will let myself drop to the floor and move my feet as if i was kicking something. Now that's when my @CAPS1 start laughing more because they say I'm hilarious.      @PERSON3 and I are the kind of people that if something is very boring to us there has to be a way to make it fun. Some teachers appreciate that we actually have fun in their class but others just don't like it at all. Like last year in @CAPS2 @CAPS3 our teacher @PERSON2 completely freaked out because @PERSON3 and I were laughing. We were paying attention but we only laughed when we were doing our work but he didn't like it. To us that class was extremely boring and we just made it fun but @PERSON2 decided to make a sitting chart. Well you would think that by having a sitting chart @PERSON3 and I wouldn't talk or laugh at all but that didn't happen. That didn't stop her or me from talking to the people around us. We would talk to them and we made class fun. When he thought that we weren't paying attention he would ask us questions and we answered them correctly. Even though @PERSON3 and I were sitting far away from each other we would move our hands around until we got each others attention and then we just started laughing because we looked funny doing all of that without saying a word.  Every day when my @CAPS1 and I eat lunch at school at our usual spot we're always laughing. People that don't really know me think I'm crazy or weird but I say that I'm just myself and that I'm very optimistic. @PERSON3 and I say ""@CAPS4 sad panda's today"" we say that when we see that one of our @CAPS1 is quiet or looks sad. The most weirdest thing is that when @PERSON3 and I laugh at the same time it sounds like one laugh. The first time we realized that we had the same laugh we just started laughing even more that we couldn't even breathe. It's important to laugh because it feels so good and you feel relieved even if you're having a really bad day, like health teachers say it takes more muscles to frown then to smile."	23	23		46				5	5	5	5	5	4	5	5	6	5	5	4						
21440	8	" Laughter is used as a ""cure"" for everything. Through out life, people underestimate the power of laughter. Laughter and joy have always been my personal way of getting to know other people better. I personally use laughter to create a bond that another person and I can relate at a level to be able to share our thoughts and our feelings through laughter. Laughter is very important through life. Laughter can help someone find people that have similar and common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Throughout life, there will always be that one person or that group of people that can enjoy similar things. I have been involved in a lot of social groups. In most of these groups laughter is a common thing between all of these groups. Without this similar interest, Laughter would not exist through life. Laughter helps through every day life. People find these common interests between people and start to create relationships between people that did not exist before. These relationships might be shown through co-workers, through authoritative figures, and friends and family throughout every day life. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" The relationships between people are built from laughter and enjoyment of being with other people. These relationships are formed at a social level with friendly people. Without these relationships, people would never have good times throughout their life. These relationships are created to help introduce the the stories about life. In my life I have had bad times and good times. The bad times that have occurred through my life are when family member have died. My great grandparents on both of my sides of my family have died. Another horrible thing that has happened in my life is that is that one of my friends died at an early age. What happened is that he was riding an all terrain vehicle. But the good things through my life have been breath taking. The one thing that has been breath taking from my life is most of my conversations with my friends. Laughter is the key point in conversation. When I first started my relationship with @PERSON1 all I could think about was being able to enjoy the times that I have with her. On the first day that we started spending time with each other we could not stop laughing. Everything that either I said or something she did was hilarious to me. The most common thing that we had in common was laughter. At every basketball game we would try and spend as much time as we can together. We try to get to know each other a little bit better by finding common interests through laughing because, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Laughter can help someone find people that have common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Laughter is used in a personal level to become closer to that person. Laughter can be used through every day life. Laughter is an element to a relationship that should always exist."	15	19		34				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	4						
21442	8	"                                        Laughter  @CAPS1 I first meet someone there is always a small wall to climb before we can really get to know eachother: @CAPS2 laugh. I have this weird awkward nervous laugh, almost like a giggle, that I don't even hear. Others do though. Especially when they first meet me. I think that most times it helps people get to know me faster. But other times, I think it is a hindrance to getting to know me.  When someone first meets me they usually always comment on @CAPS2 laugh. They either seem slightly thrown off by it, or they easily open up and joke around with me. They always tell me about it: @CAPS3 odd it is, @CAPS3 much I do it, what it's like, etc. As if I've never been told about it before. But, this is fine. I don't hear it come out and I don't mind being told. I don't really think of it as a bad thing. When they seem thrown off by @CAPS2 laughing, I get more awkward and try to control it, but usually end up doing it even more. If it seems to make them laugh and they don't make fun of me for it, I just let it come out, and it becomes very easy to get to know that person. I never really realized just @CAPS3 bad it was, until one weekend at the beach. I was on a beach retreat with @CAPS2 youth group, and one of the activities was a video scavenger hunt. We went around town and took videos of different things, actions, situations, and people. One of these things we had to get a video of was one of us playing rock paper scissors with a stranger. So I promptly went up to two older women and asked to play a game with them. When we all watched the videos later I saw and heard just @CAPS3 weird @CAPS2 voice, laugh, and mannerisms are with strangers. People had told me about them from time to time, but I'd never seen it. It was weird! Another situation was working at @LOCATION1 this @DATE1. When we did icebreaker games to break tension and meet the people on our teams more easily. Everyone on @CAPS2 team seemed slightly weirded out by me. I couldn't figure out why, until one person would just step up and be straightforward: and inform me of @CAPS2 laugh. As the first week went by though, I was the person that knew everyone on the team the best. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. It can be bridged quickly, or made greater: depending on @CAPS3 people react to it. If they join in it together, the distance is destroyed. When, however, one person doesn't join into the laughter, or doesn't enjoy the other person's laugh, this distance is greatly increased. It becomes hard to breach this distance, and the chance to do so is probably lost. And that is just too bad. We should all be able to laugh together and share in eachother's joy."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21443	8	" Every time I walk down the hall and I see a couple, they are either laughing with each other or doing other things that could disqualify my test. I know for a fact that the people that get voted cutest couple at our school are the ones that are laughing as opposed to the later. Not only does laughing create couples, then families, and eventually the next generation, but it creates friendships within schools, families, activites, etc. That's why personally I believe that laughing is the single most powerful action a person can do. Every person I am friends with have laughed with me and vice-versa. Especially one friend who I've gotten even closer since we met. I was very adament about going to church when I was young. I have always been shy and church allows me to be social with others without reticule. However I saw one girl sitting in the back corner who I felt was scared just like I probably would have been if it was anywhere else. My parents always wanted me to be more social and they said that one way to do that was to go out of my way to meet new people.  I did that for maybe the first time in my life to say ""hi"" to her. She replied by giving me her name. However I went back into my shy self and walked back terrified to talk to her or any one else again. However, I was only in third grade when all this happened so as time passed by things changed. About @NUM1 years after that a new church opened with a new class being open to children of all age groups. I had cemented myself into that classroom as one of two who regularly showed up. However this one day I was the only one who was there for my age group. Well actually I was the only one from my age group that was there on time. I saw a girl walking in with her dad who you could tell had forced her to go to the class. It took me a while to picture who it was but eventually I realized who it was. It was the girl who was scared to be in church and now she was the girl who was scared to be in class. She could clearly recognize me. I made a hand gesture telling her to come in. then you saw her smile. She shortly proceded to laughing a little bit. This was when I realized I met someone special. Now everytime I see her she smiles. That's how I know she will be a friend for a long time. Laughing can't be put into quotes, but it can be put into someone's memories for the rest of your life. I know this for a fact cause a lot of days have passed since and I still have these memories. Laughing is the easiest way to tell if a person is a true friend, something more, or should and will be forgotten."	17	25	34	34				4	4	4	4	3	3	5	5	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	3	3

21456	8	"            ""Laughter"" @CAPS1 you ever felt it? The feeling of uncontrollable joy building up inside you? The one feeling you @CAPS11 never explain in any word but one. Laughter. This is a wondrous feeling, it @CAPS11 make you do so many things, like scream, and yell! Someone once said, Laughter, is the beauty of life. It helps us get out of hard times, and @CAPS11 always put a smile on our face when we @CAPS2 down.It will make good times even better and never be forgotten. Laughter is something everyone needs. It helps us connect with people. It will causes you to be come one with another. This is the story of me. The story of how laughter caused me to meet the love of @CAPS7 life. How the connection of joy between us will last forever, and how the memories of his smile will last in me forever.  @DATE1 was the day i met him. It was a gorgeous day, snow was covering the ground for miles, and I was surrounded by @CAPS7 amazing friends. The feeling of boredom quickly flew over our heads. So we decided it was time to @CAPS1 some fun. We quickly put our snow cloths on and began running for the door. The moment we stepped out side everyone but me stopped. I kept going into the ice cold air. I slowly began to realized they had stopped and I tried to come to an immediate halt. They all began to laugh as i laid on the icy growned holding @CAPS7 soar butt. I was so embarrassed, and so shocked by @CAPS4 had just happened that i didn't move, I just laid back and closed @CAPS7 eyes. As I was laying there I began hearing foot steps. I figured they were just @CAPS7 friends coming to help me. But when i opened @CAPS7 eyes, it wasn't @CAPS7 friends I saw. It was a hansom man, one I had seen few times before in @CAPS7 high school. @CAPS3 leans down and ask me, ""@CAPS2 you okay?"" I reply in a shy tone,""yes..."" @CAPS3 smiles and reaches down to help me up. As our skin gently touches I get butterfly's all through out @CAPS7 body. I look at him and @CAPS11 tell @CAPS3 was getting the same feeling. As i stand to @CAPS7 feet we both smile and begin to laugh. I still to this day don't understand why we laughed... I am wondering a million things at once, but the first question that exits @CAPS7 mouth is, ""@CAPS4 is your name?""@CAPS3 reply's with a smile and says, "" @CAPS6 and you?""""@CAPS7 name is @CAPS8."" I reply.I begin to thank him and ask if @CAPS3 would like some hot chocolate or coffee. @CAPS3 reply's in a cute tone that sent chills up @CAPS7 spine. @CAPS3 says ""I would rather take you to get a burger, will you come?""A huge smile washes over @CAPS7 face as i say ""yes."" @CAPS3 grabs @CAPS7 hand and walks me closer to @CAPS7 friends. They all began to smile and turn and walk away quickly into the depths of @CAPS7 house. @CAPS3 smiles and decides not to follow. We both begin to laugh as we run over to his car. I @CAPS1 heard a lot about @CAPS6, @CAPS7 friends @CAPS2 always talking about how cute and muscular @CAPS3 is. The first thought that went streaming through @CAPS7 head was, I cant believe @CAPS3 wants to take me out to lunch!  We sit awkwardly in the car all the way to a small dinner called @ORGANIZATION1. When we stop @CAPS3 jumps out of the car and rushes to @CAPS7 door to open it. @CAPS3 is such a gentle men i thought to myself. When we get to our table @CAPS3 orders for us both and asks me all sorts of questions. @CAPS3 kept me smiling the hole time! I don't think any boy has ever done that. After we ate and @CAPS3 drove me home we smiled and laughed as @CAPS3 told me joke after joke. When we reach @CAPS7 house @CAPS3 asks me a question. A question i will never forget. ""@CAPS11 i kiss you?"" @CAPS3 asks. I do not answer but lean in and kiss him. We look into each others eyes after wards and begin to laugh.. Why we laughed i still will never know. But at that moment i fell in love. At that moment i realized laughter will be the connection between us forever. The laughter is in remembrance of him. @MONTH1 @CAPS3 rest in peace...

21457	8	"Like all great things in life, laughter is the thing that keeps me going. Without laughter I'm depleted. I'll tell you about the three things that make me laugh the most in life. First is @CAPS1 mom. (@LOCATION1) @CAPS1 mom is the one that showed me, laughing is the key to almost everything. She showed me it's okay to fall down. Laugh at the fact you're silly, you messed up but make sure to get back up. @CAPS1 mom can make me laugh no matter what is going on in @CAPS1 teenage ""drama"" life. The biggest thing I've learned is when I'm emotionally broken, when I feel the whole world is against me and I just don't want to be me anymore to laugh through it. When me and @CAPS1 best friend got into a fight @TIME1 @DATE1 I didn't come out of @CAPS1 house for about a week and a half, I didn't want to talk to any of @CAPS1 friends. @CAPS1 mom tried to get me to call her but I never did, till one day @CAPS1 mom sat down on @CAPS1 bed and said ""@CAPS2 it's not want happens to you it's what you do with it, do you hear me laughing all the time, when I'm upset, sad and happy...that's what I want you to do no matter what is going on in your ""drama"" teenage life don't shrug it off @CAPS2 laugh it off, call her.""@CAPS1 @CAPS5 friends definitely take second place. Like @CAPS1 friends, I also have @CAPS5. When I'm with them nothing else phases me, the whole world could be ending and I wouldn't notice a thing. I feel since I have @CAPS5 I speak a different language that most people can't understand besides @CAPS1 friends with @CAPS5. @CAPS1 friends are very random and have a lot of energy. One thing that they taught me is having @CAPS5 is a gift and a curse. When @PERSON1 and I are hanging out it doesn't matter who we're around we make there day, we can't help feeling goofy plus the non-stop laughing. Sometimes it gets us into things like people our age think we're laughing at them when we're really not.Third place is me. I make myself laugh more than anyone or anything. I'm a total comedian. When I try to be funny I'm not that funny but when I don't try I make people laugh so hard they cry. @CAPS1 whole life I've been told ""@CAPS2, wow you really are something no matter what mood someone's in you just make life seem so amazing."" @CAPS11 people laugh is one thing but @CAPS11 myself laugh is very different. When I was sitting on the floor in @CAPS1 room @TIME1 I was thinking about @CAPS1 past life and became pretty upset but to pull myself out of the negative thinking I started thinking about the good times I've and within five minutes I was laughing so hard @CAPS1 stomach hurt.     Like I said ""like all great things"" laughter is @CAPS1 greatest. Laughing really can open someones eyes. I will continue to live laughing and eventually pass it down when the time comes.

21458	8	"In any relationship, things like physical contact, verbal conversations, or any kind of outward expression at all is very important. More particularly, laughing is key as well, to any kind of iteracton with someone. Laughing says,""what you are saying is funny"" or, I'm enjoying this"". Laughing says a lot without saying a word. Think about someone you know very well. It might be your best friend, or it might be a family member. If you think about it, you can tell when they are mad, sad, angry, frustrated, just by looking at their facial expressions or looking into their eyes. When you see them laugh, you see happiness. Its so obvious, because their eyes sparkle, their face lights up, and you just know that they are cheery. Now think about when you are hanging out with your friends. Being with friends is always fun, and we love it. That's why we go do things with them right? And when we are with them, we laugh a lot. We tell funny stories, we share inside jokes, and fun memories that make us laugh, and we love that, we love the feeling we get when we are with them,and most of all, we love the moments that make us laugh. Maybe its a long car ride, a sleepover, or maybe its at a party or church perhaps. Have you ever noticed that when one person laughs, the rest of the group follows in unison? Laughter is contagious, making it hard to resist most of the time. Whether it be a joke that was told, or that someone made a fool of themselves, its always a favorite part of any gathering or party, or whatever it @MONTH1 be. Some people say that each time you laugh, a few seconds are added to your life. Im not so sure I believe that, but I do believe laughing is healthy. I know that when I laugh, i feel so much better. Whenever I get back from hanging out with my three closest friends, I feel great. It's like whatever else that was getting to me that week or day is just forgotten, and especially if we laugh a lot, it makes me feel good. When a friend or someone else we know is down in the dumps,what is the first thing most of us resort to? It's going to be making them laugh right? Because laughter is a big part of being happy. When someone laughs, they find it hard to resist being cheered up. For this reason, I believe that laughter is the best medicine of all. It's so hard not to feel better when laughing. Once again, I believe that laughter is important in any human relationship, because laughing shows that you are either enjoying their company, just like smiling at all the right moments, or making the right face when they are telling a story, and showing them that you are engaged in the conversation. If someone is telling a funny story, or a joke, laughing shows that you get the humor in what they are saying. If you are enjoying being with that person, laugh a lot. Show them that you love hanging out with them. People love making other people laugh. Whether you are laughing at a joke, a funny story, or a face they made, or all of the above, laughing is just as important in any situation. Just like the saying goes for smiling, everyone laughs in the same language. Laughter says the same thing all around the world. Laughter is is almost always a good sign, and means something is going right."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21467	8	" It was my first year of @CAPS1. high school and I was feeling pretty confident. I had great teachers and all the classes I wanted. My first day was going awesome! I had woken up on time, eaten a good breakfast, and I didn't even miss the school bus. My first few classes were fabulous and I was about to go to lunch. As the bell rang I hurried to the cafeteria to get a good spot in line. One of my close friends had called my name so I turned to wave and when I turned back I ran directly into @LOCATION1. We hit hard. I flew backwards dropping everything I was carrying. I tried to say I was sorry but all she did was glare at me and walk away. As I picked up my books I realized I didn't want anything to do with that girl and decided I'd just forget about what had just happened.   After lunch I had @CAPS2. I was extra excited for this class because the boy of my dreams, @PERSON1, was in it. On my way there I made a quick pit-stop to the ladies room to make sure I still looked decent and then headed to class. As I walked in the room the first thing I saw was @PERSON1's beautiful blond hair and his dazzling blue eye. Then I registered the whole scene. Guess who was twirling her hair and batting her eye lashes at my dream guy! You got it, @LOCATION1. From that moment on it was war! As the year progressed @LOCATION1 and I constantly strove to out do each other. We'd race each other to class to see who would get to sit behind @PERSON1. She always had to have the best hair. I would get a cute new hair cut and she would get high lights. I received a phone. So she went out and bought the latest and greatest phone with the built in music player. I remember getting to class early one day, so excited to show @PERSON1 this new game I'd learned. But of course when I walked in the room @LOCATION1 was already showing him the exact same game. There was one thing I always had over @LOCATION1, books. Both @PERSON1 and I loved books. We would sit and talk about the latest and greatest books for hours. This always made @LOCATION1 jealous. Our childish behavior went on like this for three or four months. One day at lunch I was just sitting, eating my food, and minding my own business. All of the sudden @LOCATION1 appeared out of nowhere and spit soda at my face. That did it. This was the last straw. I grabbed my milk carton and dumped it on her head. The cafeteria went silent for about a minute. @LOCATION1 and I stood there glaring at each other, rage searing from our eyes until some one broke the silence with a loud laugh. Soon everyone was laughing, including @LOCATION1 and I. We realized just how stupid we'd been acting and for the first time we were laughing together not at each other. We both apologized and helped each other get cleaned up.  Eventually we became really good friends. To this day we still laugh about or @NUM1 grade rivalry."	25	20		45				5	5	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21471	8	" Laughter, one of the greatest gifts in life. It's what helps you get through the day, the year and in the long term, your life. For me, many things can go wrong in a day. For example, I could forget about an assignment that ends up being a big part of my grade or just have a difficult day. All i need to make those bad things seem like old memories is to have a long and pleasant laugh. It is ten times better if that laugh is shared with someone else. That's why when i moved to @LOCATION1,@CAPS1 I tried to keep a look out for kids like me, who loved to laugh and make other people laugh. The first days were rough. I met a lot of new people that were all the same. Some just wanted to know my name and others to get to know me better, and that was fine. There was one person that I noticed was in multiple of my classes. So one day when our @CAPS2 teacher asked us to partner up and write a myth of creation or how something got to be the way it is. Quickly, I looked around to choose someone before every one would have a partner and I would be sitting there awkwardly without a partner. I asked a boy who was in few other of my classes. I had not really noticed or even heard him talk. He agreed to be my partner. We introduced ourselves and he told me his name was @PERSON1. He had a very quite voice. I had barely understood his name, so i had to read it from his paper. We had to work on the paper together but it felt more like if we were doing it individually. I began by throwing some ideas around. @PERSON1 would then say something and laugh but I could never hear what he would say. We worked on the paper for a couple of days, continuing to only interchange some words.  Meanwhile I was still trying to make at least one good friend. I thought maybe threw that friend i could meet some of his friends and in time I would have my own set of friends. In the meantime I ate lunch with my sister @PERSON2. You would think it would be slightly awkward or uncomfortable. It wasn't though, it was actually pretty nice because our bond had become stronger. That would work well for both of us until we made some friends. After some time she had made a couple of friends and was ready to move on. So one day while we were both eating lunch one of her new friends passed by and asked her to go sit with her. I hoped so bad that she would just say no or even say, maybe tomorrow, but no.  There I was sitting by myself in a lunch room full of eyes that were just judging who you were sitting with, if anyone. I began to eat my lunch faster than you could say sternocleidomastoid, and I was out of there. Panicking in the inside but completely calm on the outside, I paced the hallways looking for someone to hang out with. Then I saw ""That @CAPS3"" from three of my classes. I casually walked up to him and tried to start a conversation. For some reason i felt relaxed not as if I was trying to make a new friend but as if I was already talking to one.  In the beginning, we were just two guys that talked about classes and how this school was different from my previous. Then all of a sudden we began to talk about movies especially the resent more funny ones. We could not stop laughing in all of our classes, especially auto mechanics. We would use up all of our shop time just trying to remember all of the funny lines from the movies and trying to say them or act them out the best we could. Soon we also found out that we watched many of the same t.v. shows. We could make each other laugh with pretty much anything one of us said. I had noticed this special quality in @PERSON1 that made him extremely funny. I wasn't sure what it was,but with anything he said I would just laugh uncontrollably. We were laughing buddies, but soon we actually became great friends. We had really bonded in between the laughter. During that time we would find out new things about each other. That made us realize that we were a lot alike. Its been a few months and we have only become greater friends. I had made friends before by making them laugh or laughing at there jokes.

21472	8	"I have lived in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 almost my whole life, I went to pre @CAPS5 all the way up to @NUM1 grade. @CAPS7 was about half way into my @DATE1 when my mom had told me the ""@CAPS3"" news. Honey we are moving, i froze in shock i didn't know what to think, no we can't move. why she said, um maybe because im going into @CAPS4 @CAPS5. I don't want to go somewhere where i have no clue who anybody is. Don't worry my mom said you will make some friends. Where are we moving any wise i asked? Lebanon she answered me in a soft @CAPS1 voice. @CAPS6 i guess its not that far away from here. There you go she said @CAPS7 wont be that bad once we get there and get everything settled in and unpacked. Yeah @CAPS13 i still don't know anybody there, @CAPS6 your cousin @PERSON2 goes there and he is a junior so he could maybe drive you to @CAPS5 everyday if you wanted and introduce you to some people. Okay i said i was excited @CAPS13 i didn't want to move away from @CAPS8. We started to pack up our things, @CAPS7 took us about a week to get everything out of the old house into the new one. After the house was all packed and our things where out we started to clean. We cleaned from the up stares all the way down, head to toe that took us about two days tops to do. So in all total @CAPS7 took us about a week and two days to get everything packed, moved out, and cleaned. We said our @CAPS11 byes to our friends and family and where on our way. Its not like we will never see them again i said to my brothers. We finally pulled up to the house, @CAPS8 was so anxious to see what @CAPS7 looked like. My mom opened the doors go check @CAPS7 out she said, wow this place is amazing we love @CAPS7 the boys said. I told you that you guys would love @CAPS7. We went up stares and picked out our rooms. there was only four bedrooms so the two younger boys had to share. When we where all done with that we stared to unpack our stuff. I was so tired from doing everything that after i was done unpacking my room i went and took a nape on my bed. When i woke up i realized that i have not unpacked everything like i though i did, so i finished with that. @CAPS5 started in about a week i was so excited @CAPS13 nervous @TIME1 the same time to see what @CAPS7 would be like. Finally the day was here, honey wake up time for @CAPS5 mom said already @CAPS13... oh forget @CAPS7 i said im groin to @CAPS5 no matter what. I get out of bed brush my teeth, hair, do my make up and get dressed. ""@CAPS9"" ""@CAPS9"" @PERSON2 is here time to go. I rush down stares get my back pack and get in the car. @CAPS11 morning he said @CAPS11 morning, you excited for @CAPS5 he asked yeah kinda just a little nervous.Don t be i will introduce you to my girlfriend she is a fresh man also k sounds @CAPS11 i said.

This is you first period @PERSON1 she teaches @CAPS12 arts. He shows me the rest of the six and sends me to class. I walk in @CAPS8 staring @TIME1 me, my sstomach turning into notes wanting to fall out of my stomach. Welcome @LOCATION1 just sit down i will be with you shortly the teacher says. She shows me where to sit ans introduces me to the class. Finally the class is over, @CAPS13 i still have to go to six more. This day feels like its going bye for ever, i walk to the rest of my classes wondering if they will not be that scary @CAPS13 no i was wrong. Most of the teachers made me introduce my self in the front of the class @CAPS7 was terrifying! I get on the bus can't wait to get @CAPS2. I walk threw the doors, how was your day, did you make friends, mom calm down i said to her sorry i just want to know. My day was @CAPS11, can i go take a shower now? Yeah just don't take long k.

21479	8	" Laughter can be helpful in many ways and with many things. Like, if your having a bad day, a friend can try and make you laugh to help you feel better. Or maybe something like you lost a loved one. Yes it's a very tragic thing, especially if you really close to that family member. People will still try and make you laugh and tell you that there in a better place and won't be in pain anymore. I have had some moments like this and I sometimes felt better after the person or persons have made me laugh. I also know that I have people that care for me and want me to be happy and full of laughter. The most recent time I have needed someone to help me laugh was yesterday. It was yesterday night, I had math homework that I needed too do. It frustrated me so much, I started too cry. i told my boyfriend this and he just started telling all of these silly jokes. They kind of helped. What helped the most though was when he had said he could come over this @DATE1. I started smiling and laughing because I was so happy that he could. Another time that I have had laughter help me was when I was at @CAPS1 with my mom, dad, brother, and little sister about @NUM1 years ago. My brother decided that he want too take me on @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I can't remember if that was the ride though. Anyway, he took me in it about @NUM2 or @NUM3 time. I was so scared, and wet that I didn't talk too him for the rest of the day. He finally apologized and took me too a face painter lady in one of the stores. I chose what I wanted on my face, I can't quite remember what it was though, I think it was some kind of fish. But, after she had finished, I looked in the mirror she had and I burst out laughing. I laughed for about ten minutes and said that I accepted his apology. When we arrived home a few days later, I took the hose and sprayed him with it just too get him back. And too be a little stinker of a sister, like all little sisters should be every once and a while in my opinion. Thank gosh it was during the @DATE2 because me and him did it a few more times just too be brats too mom and dad. Lastly, I remember this one time in @NUM4 grade when my best friend @CAPS4 was moving. I cried for days and days. Then finally he calls me and we talked for about @NUM5 hours, and talking too him just made me laugh, and wish that he hadn't of moved. At least I still got too talk too him. Only about once or twice though. anyway, those times talking too him made me so happy. We talked about his dogs. One of his dogs names is @CAPS5, she was about @NUM6 months at the time. She started chasing her tail and when she went around about @NUM6 times, she tripped over her feet and fell on her rump. So, to end this trip down memory lane. Those three blasts from the pasts were the ones that made me laugh too help me feel better when I was feeling upset, or down."	16	15		31				3	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21481	8	"Have @CAPS3 ever had that one moment with some that @CAPS3'll remember forever and laugh about every time @CAPS3 think about @CAPS2.? @CAPS8 I have and I think that everyone should have a moment of laughter in there life. On the day of @DATE1 was the day that I will laugh about for the rest of my life. On this day my boyfriend @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 decided that @CAPS1 wanted to take me out to an early breakfast. @CAPS1 called me around four in the morning saying that @CAPS1 was starving and that @CAPS1 needed some food in his stomach. So @CAPS1 picked me up around five am and we went to @ORGANIZATION1. We sat there drank coffee and ate pancakes. We finished very early so @PERSON1 wanted to go for a drive, let me remind @CAPS3 @CAPS1's from @LOCATION1 so @CAPS1 has @CAPS6 clue where anything is in @LOCATION2. So as we head out of town I am giving him directions to where the best place is to go for a drive. We are in his @DATE2 poniac which is not the greatest vehicle to be going for a ride in around this town, because around here @CAPS3 need a four wheel drive vehicle otherwise @CAPS3're probably going to get stuck where ever @CAPS3 go. We were doing great at first because we stayed on the pavement roads, but @PERSON1 wanted to explore the gravel roads. So we started to go down a gravel road and we both decided that maybe @CAPS2 was time to go home. When we came up to another road @CAPS1 decided @CAPS1 was going to turn around. That was not the greatest idea. @CAPS1 seen the sign for the street but @CAPS1 turned the wrong way into a field. @CAPS2 was okay, @CAPS8 as first @CAPS2 was . Until @CAPS1 went to back up, and the car wouldn't move. I looked at him and laughed and said ""I told @CAPS3 that @CAPS3 needed to go right not left."" @CAPS1 then looked at me and said, ""@CAPS2's not stuck I just need to try a little more, and we'll be out."" One thing that @PERSON1 did not know is that @CAPS2 had been warm in @LOCATION2 the last couple of days, so all the fields were very wet and soft. I looked at him and told him that @CAPS1 might not want to @CAPS5 that but @CAPS1 said that is was fine @CAPS1's done this before. So I got out of the car and went and stood by the road. @PERSON1 tried to get the car out of the mud for at least ten minutes, and that was not the greatest thing to @CAPS5, because now the tires were berried under the mud. I started to laugh so hard because @CAPS1 got out of the car and looked at me and said I should have listened. @PERSON1 had one more thing that @CAPS1 wanted to try, because @CAPS6 offense but @CAPS1's a boy and they can @CAPS5 everything themselves. So @CAPS1 told me to get into the car and put @CAPS2 in reverse so I did as @CAPS1 said, then @CAPS1 said okay lightly push on the gas as I push, @CAPS8 I did a little more then lightly push on the gas. I looked up and @PERSON1 was covered in mud from head to toe. @CAPS2 was the greatest thing I have seen in my life, my boyfriend had got what @CAPS1 deserved because @CAPS1 wouldn't listen to me. I looked at him and my eyes instantly started to water, I was trying to hold my laugh in, but @CAPS2 just wasn't working. I started to laugh and @CAPS1 looked at me and said, ""@CAPS3 think this is funny?"" @CAPS1 then pulled me out of the car and shut the door and started to wipe mud all over my face, I was laughing so hard that i fell and took him down with me right into the mud. @CAPS8 to make the story even better, we went to go open the doors to the car, and @CAPS3 remember how I told @CAPS3 that I put the car in reverse @CAPS8 when @CAPS1 pulled me out i didn't take @CAPS2 out of reverse, and his car locks when its not in park. I then looked at him and said, "" @CAPS5 @CAPS3 have an extra key on @CAPS3 by chance?"" ""@CAPS6"", @CAPS1 said, ""@CAPS7?"" I looked at him and said, ""@CAPS8 lets see the car is still running, the windows are up, our phones are still in the car, and @CAPS8 to finish @CAPS2 off the doors are locked."" @CAPS1 looked at me and his mouth dropped. We sat there waiting for almost an hour and a half before anyone came down the road. @CAPS2 took use about forty-three minutes to get the doors unlocked, and then @CAPS2 took us about thirty minutes to get @CAPS2 unstuck. When I got home I told my family the story, and we still laugh about @CAPS2 to this day."	18	20	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
21494	8	"Laughter. Some might think of it as just a simple reaction to something funny, but in reality laughter can be many things such as a way to cope with situations, a way to express yourself, or just a simple way to enjoy yourself when you are around friends. For me the meaning of laughing has changed a lot during my lifetime, when I was younger I used to laugh to enjoy myself or just to have fun with peers, but as I have grown older I have used laughter to cope with situations. On @DATE1 the morning of my @NUM1 birthday I found out some disturbing and disappointing news, that day I found out that my mom had passed away. When I first found out I didn't know what to do the only thing that I felt I could do was cry and grief about it and shut down into a depressed stage, many of my friends tried to help me and tried to tell me that ""things were going to be okay"". I knew they were right, but the only thing I could think was even if things turn out okay things will never be the same. At this time I thought to myself what will @CAPS1 be like? what am I going to do on mothers day?, and my biggest question of all how was I supposed to celebrate my own birthday?. It's hard knowing that someone that I love and had been with for @NUM2 years of my life is gone, but since my mom has passed away I have tried to stay focused on the positives and what she would have wanted for me like graduating high school, becoming successful, and not letting my life spiral down hill. Even though everyday for me is hard I still try to push through it and just remember that my mom wouldn't want me to give up on my life over her passing. You might ask yourself how I am coping with this loss, and the answer to that is that I have learned to cope with my situation with laughter. Growing up my mom always told me that ""laughter is the best medicine"". And after losing her I realized that that statement was true.Now whenever I get upset or sad I remind myself to think about the memories that I have had with my mom and laugh about the good experiences and times we had , and I sometimes even find myself laughing at some of the arguments we had. Laughing has been helping me cope fairly well in the past four months since my mom has passed away, and I hope it continues to help in the future, but I continuously think that ""sure I can laugh about things now, but what about in ten years?"" I guess the future is just going to remain a mystery for that, but one thing I do know about my future is that I will become successful, and even if laughter doesn't always work for me I will stay strong and be sure to live my life the way I would if I still had my mom, it will be hard doing it without the guidance and authority of having my mother there, but fortunately I am not dealing with any of this alone.One person that has been there through the whole situation has been my aunt, she has been in my life since day one, my mom and I even lived with her. I am grateful that my aunt has been there for me during my life, if she wasn't I don't know where I would be right now, she has taught me that I can't isolate myself or stop being a teenager just because I don't have my mom, but to live life to the fullest and live the life my mom would have wanted to see me live, she also tells me that laughing at bad situations is okay and to not keep things bottled up and I am very happy I have someone to go through this with.Having someone there for me in such a tough situation is very reassuring to me. Knowing that I have someone to go to and just talk about the past and be able to have someone to laugh with about it. Laughing is hard when you do it by yourself but one thing that I have noticed is that when you have friends and family that are going through the same situation as you it is easier to share your feelings and I think it also makes it easier to laugh when you have people that you are close to and people that care about you around. In some situations laughter might not be the best thing to do, but the best advice I can give to someone who might happen to be going through a similar situation is to not stop living your life and be something great and try to release some of the stress of a situation by laughing with friends."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	4	4	3						
21502	8	"A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 A @CAPS4 @CAPS5. I felt simply @CAPS5. I was very stoical; my life was nadir. Helplessly. I had written a @CAPS2 to my hero; no reply. I was determine to wait @CAPS3 see if my hero would ever reply.... My hero is amazing, lighting, astounding; his name is @PERSON6. I understand his music.  My best friend @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I, would always talk about how awesome his music is; in fact @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started because of @ORGANIZATION1. We were two different people; I didn'@CAPS8 even think we could be friends, or have anything in common. @CAPS20' music brought us together.  @CAPS17 @CAPS3 I wrote a @CAPS2 to @LOCATION1; I thought to myself ""@PERSON6 is not even going to look at it,"" but I watched @PERSON4 write the @CAPS2. Weeks @CAPS3 weeks past by @CAPS3 I really thought @ORGANIZATION1 wasn'@CAPS8 going to read or reply. After that @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started to dilapidated. I felt discourage; we only talked about @PERSON6 @CAPS3 @CAPS6 photography project. We were really procrastinating toward @CAPS6 project; I had been a little distracted with cheer-leading @CAPS3 homework form the high school; not college homework. I was ignoring @PERSON4 calls @CAPS3 texts. Until I realize I had made a wrong choice; @CAPS15 I called my friend @PERSON4--thank god I did. A week later @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I @CAPS3 two of my friends: @PERSON5, my best friend since seventh grade; @LOCATION2, my best friend since eighth grade, had went to watch this really vehement movie. After the movie we went to meet up with some friends at the dorms. On @CAPS6 way there, @PERSON2 @CAPS3 I were telling @PERSON5 @CAPS3 @PERSON4 about @CAPS6 amazing experience in health: @CAPS6 health teacher had given us an assignment about what a perfect body should look like. @PERSON2 @CAPS3 I, facetious made an alien-looking body. The toes of this alien were coming out of its shoes @CAPS3 @CAPS6 alien had warts all over. We laughed non-stop, obviously we didn'@CAPS8 turn it in. When we arrived to the dorms, @CAPS3 @PERSON4 presented me to his friend @CAPS8.J; @CAPS18 was a big fan of @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS9."" @CAPS10 we played various games I notice @CAPS8.J, had some warts on his hands, @CAPS3 when @CAPS18 took off his shoes; to put on his saddles, I couldn'@CAPS8 help but notice @CAPS18 somewhat reminded me of @CAPS6 drawing. I hysterically started to laugh non-stop, my friend @CAPS12 kept asking me why I was laughing, I said ""@CAPS8.J looks like my alien,"" @CAPS18 said ""wow that's rude."" I said ""In my eyes that's the perfect body."" We all had a good laugh @CAPS3 kept playing games @CAPS3 listening to @ORGANIZATION1. The next day @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I had to meet, to work on @CAPS6 photography project. All we had to accomplish was to take pictures of each-other @CAPS3 the things that we like @CAPS3 dislike. It was called: getting to really know a person. I learned a lot about @PERSON4 threw this project. In my opinion, I sometimes live life to fast, @CAPS3 I can barely catch my breath. I want to do everything but school @CAPS3 sports sometimes held me back; not in a bad way. I just have less time to hangout with friends or simply rest. But I love my life @CAPS3 wouldn'@CAPS8 trade it; everything that I do gets me closer to my goal: @CAPS14.B.I agent. This project was vehement. To me it was a @CAPS1, a way of life telling me ""hang on, you'll make it;"" all due to a simple call. We were working hard, when @PERSON4 phone kept ringing. I was a little cantankerous. I said "" @PERSON4 answer the phone!"" @CAPS15 @CAPS18 did. @CAPS18 said "" oh my god, @CAPS16 is @PERSON6, I said ""stop messing around, now lets get back to work!"" @CAPS17 put his phone on speaker, @CAPS3 there it was; my hero on the phone! I was @CAPS15 happy that I started to cry, how could this be happening to us! I blacked-out, it was like I was stoical. How could this ever happen to ""quotidian teens."" I could hear @PERSON4 talking to @ORGANIZATION1 but I was making my my mind convoluted. I took a gasp of air, @CAPS3 said ""hello."" (I was still in shock.) @CAPS18 said "" hello @PERSON3, good luck in track."" @CAPS3 that's when I past-out. When I woke up @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I couldn'@CAPS8 believe it. We cried, then to ease the tension, @PERSON4 said ""@CAPS16, you talked to your husband."" We laughed for a long time. @CAPS17 @CAPS3 I have the best memory together. @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started because of @CAPS20 music, @CAPS3 it will never end. That day I realized: one: miracles happen; two: laugh heals the heart; @CAPS3 three: always have faith, never give up, someone will always hear you @CAPS3 give you advice when everything feels like is coming down on you @CAPS3 if it is as @PERSON1 said ""jump of a cliff, @CAPS3 built your wings on the way down,"" or someone will help you built them!

21506	8	"  I love laughing! Laughing makes me feel satisfied and happy. When I laugh with someone I don't know, I feel like I've known them for a long time. When I laugh with someone I do know, I feel fully content. But there is one person with whom I love to laugh with most of all, my cousin @PERSON1. I think that laughing is an important part of our relationship because when we laugh, its magical. Magical as in how fast and @CAPS5 it takes to make one of us laugh. We will say almost anything, the most random but humorous things, then we will laugh until we literally cry.   One @TIME1, when we were talking on the phone, we decided to call up our other cousin anonymously. When he didn't pick up we hung up disappointed. I was thinking of the @CAPS1 movie that I had just watched a few hours ago and an idea slowly started coming to me. I started talking in @CAPS1 to my cousin, pretending that I was our aunt from @LOCATION2. I told her how I was coming over for a visit in the @DATE1 @CAPS11 they had better be prepared. I like my bed nice and soft, fluffy pillows, and my own bathroom. I was the picky aunt. I want everything perfect for when I come. We laughed and laughed. Then @PERSON1 says to me, ""@CAPS3 don't we call @CAPS4 again and if he doesn't pick up, we'll leave a message."" ""@CAPS5 will we say in the message?"", I asked. ""@CAPS6'll just say that @CAPS6're his aunt from @LOCATION2 and that @CAPS6're coming for a visit and all the rest @CAPS6'll just make up.""""@CAPS7"", I said hesitantly. I dialed star six seven then his number and pressed talk.  Luckily, no one picked up. But when the answering machine beeped allowing me to record a message, I was speechless. Then I started in my high picky aunt voice, ""@CAPS8 @CAPS4, this is your aunt @LOCATION1 and I..."" I burst out laughing before I could continue. ""I.. I'm coming over for a visit in.."", again I exploded. I could hear @PERSON1 laughing in the background, which made me laugh even harder. I tried again this time getting farther into the story laughing here and there. By the time I had reached the maximum amount of time for the message, I was @CAPS11 into it that I didn't want to stop. When the message ended, I was only half way done. @CAPS11 after the answering machine was done talking, I pressed two to here my message. As I listened, I couldn't help thinking about @CAPS5 a complete fool I sounded like. @PERSON1 kept shushing me each time I laughed to loud, but I could tell she wanted to laugh too. She was just holding it in. When I hung up, I called her back and when she answered I said, ""@CAPS10 do it again because I didn't finish.""@CAPS11 we called again and this time I said the rest more willingly and I barely laughed. I was saving it for when we listened to it.   When we had our fill of laughter and wiping tears, @PERSON1 said, ""That was the most hilarious thing we ever did together, we have to do it again sometime."" ""For sure"", I told her. But it was late into the @TIME1, and time to go. When we had finished our good bye's and I love @CAPS6's we hung up. That @TIME1 and every other time I laugh, I think @CAPS5 would it be like if no one could laugh. @CAPS5 a boring place this would be, @CAPS5 a lifeless life. When I laugh, I feel lively. I want to live to laugh another day. If there were no laughter, that would be a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.   "	25	20		45				5	5	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21509	8	"So one day I was at home babysitting my little brother. It was a super boring day. So go check my email, and I get an email from my boyfriend. I got excited to talk to him becuase I got my phone taken away. I open it, and it was a break up email. It was so shocking. I wanted to cry. So I called my mom on the home phone, and asked if my best friend @PERSON1 could come over. My mom said yes. I called my best friend @PERSON1 and tolled her what had happened, and asked her to come over. By this time I was crying my eyes out. @PERSON1 said yes to comeing over! @PERSON1 is my best friend in the whole world! She always knows what to do, and say when I'm upset. I was waiting for her for a long time. Her mom always takes forever when she out doing things. She finally gets to my house, and she gives me a big hug! We are always there for one a other. I have always been there when all of @CAPS1 boyfriends had dumped her so it felt nice for her to be for me this time. I haven't had as any boyfriends as she had. So we go to my room, and I'm still crying. I couldn't stop. It was like a river fellowing down my face. Being dumped really is a horriable feeling. He was the best boyfriend ever, so the he dmped me was very unlike him. @PERSON1 was just sitting there texting. I was think why are you just texting you should comforting me. I didn't want to say it so I didn't. So started to talk and we desided to go to the mall. Thats always a fun place to be. So we ask my mom. She just got home. She said no. I really didn't want to be home anywhere was better any home at that time. So we went back to my room, I was crying again. So @PERSON1 started to say bad things about my ex-boyfriend. I knew the things weren't true, but it was really really funny. We were both laughing really hard and I was starting to feel better! Yay @PERSON1 making up stupid ex-boyfriend jokes! Laughter is the best way to make everthing better!"	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21514	8	" I think laughter should be a huge part in everyoneas life. For examlpe; laughter has brought my mother and I closer than we have ever been before. One time we were sitting in her camper and we had not been with each other for a whole month so we just let everything out, and laughing was one of the things. We were laughing about fake teeth, we laughed so hard that I made my mom tinkle her pants. We talked about fake teeth for about an hour. I think laughing makes everyone feel better about themselves, it does me. Laughing is a good way to show someone that you know how to have fun and it's not a bad thing. For someone to know how to laugh and to have fun is a good way to start a friendship or even a relationship. Another example is; @CAPS1 I'm with all of my friends I can never stop laughing, and I love it because I'm not sad. @CAPS1 I was a little girl my family and I went to disneyland and it was the beast time of my life there was not one moment @CAPS1 I was not laughing with all of them. One thing I don't understand is how someone couldn't be laughing or smiling at least @CAPS1 someone says or does something funny. Well back to my story of my mother and I, We were all tired and had a long day and fake teeth just made us all laugh, and laugh it was the best time I think I have ever ahd with my mother. I have always said to everyone I know ""live life while you can you don't know how long you'll have it."" I think that those words are very true and while your living life, laugh. My grandfather is pretty funny to @CAPS1 he is in a good mood he is always making everyone around him laugh. One time he had seen this commercial and it was a plastic grandpa singing ""I'm not your daddy I'm your grandpa"" and it said that maybe four times, and ever since he heard that he sings it all over the house. In conclusion laughing is the best way to feel better about anything. So @CAPS1 your blue just think about something that will always make you laugh and laugh about it."	15	19		34				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	4	4	4	4						
21518	8	" Laughter is almost always a good thing, mainly because when people laugh it means their happy or something is funny. It can be very beneficial at times, for instance when someone is not feeling to happy people always try to make them laugh to make them feel better. When I am faced with someone I don't know usually my first instinct is to try to and them laugh. laughter has always been a source of enjoyment and it still is today, We have certain advantages now than we had one hundred years ago. For instance now @CAPS2 we want to laugh we need only to pick up remote and turn on the @CAPS1, we can even choose what we want to laugh at and we even have the ability to go and search for something to laugh at on the internet. Sometimes people go to comedy clubs to go and see a stand up comedians. Comedy and laughter go hand in hand, from the very first time someone laughed comedy was born and will be around forever unless being happy becomes outlawed. I remember that when ever my parents would have a new friend over then only thing I would hear when they were at my house was then sound of both my parents and our new guest laughing. Soon the new guest was over much more often.  Laughing is also a very important part of any relationship because it makes the person whom is making the other laugh more of a pleasure to be around and thus makes them sometimes like them more, @CAPS2 you have ever noticed men usually try to make the women laugh in order to try to get that member of the opposite sex to like them. This and the accompanying of physical attraction help start the relationship. I have herd but am not certain that laughter can also be therapeutic, sometimes I like to laugh when I'm not felling so good so it @MONTH1 possibly be therapeutic for me. @CAPS2 this is so than people have been going through therapy for many years. Sometimes people laugh even @CAPS2 the subject is not funny they only do this because otherwise the situation would be somewhat awkward and one might fell kind of out of place. Everyone has a different laugh some are louder than others and some have a type of rhythm to them, my mother has a very loud and high pitched laugh and my grandpa has a low and scratchy laugh, no matter what your laugh is like it can help you feel better it can also help you become closer to someone. laughing is just one of life's greatest pleasures and we should all take a chance to just sit and laugh."	19	20	40	40				4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
21519	8	"Library @CAPS1 @CAPS2 past @DATE1 instead of sitting at home doing nothing, I decided to get a volunteer job at the library. Some @MONTH1 say that a library is not a funny place but to my best friend @PERSON1 and I it was full of numerous and humerous adventures. There was the time with the creepy, stalker guy whom we like to call @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the time that we decided to be super spies, and the different people who decided that we were to loud and weren't to nice about telling us. We worked hard in that library but who says you can't laugh a little on the job?  @CAPS3 @CAPS4, by definition it means he is some one who likes to @CAPS3, but @CAPS2 guy was just to funny. One day @PERSON1 and I had just got done working and we were waiting for her grandma to pick us up, when some strange guy sits down and starts staring at @ORGANIZATION1 like he knew her. He then preceded to ask us countless questions like, ""@CAPS6 your names?"" and ""@CAPS7 you guys have boyfriends?"". Being me I didn't say a word and let @PERSON1 talk the whole time. He also kept telling us how beautiful we were, which made us laugh even harder because @CAPS2 situation just kept getting weirder and weirder. Since his nickname is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 you can only guess @CAPS6 he asked us next. Oh yes he asked us if we wanted to start a @CAPS3 line in the middle of the library. Thankfully @PERSON1's grandma showed up just in time to save us and we only saw the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 once or twice after that because he moved away shortly after @CAPS2 encounter. Being a spy was one of the most hardest and funniest things that @PERSON1 and I ever did at the library. It all started when we noticed @CAPS2 cute guy sitting all by himself at a table that we could clearly see through some book shelves not that far away. Being the adventurous type I talked @PERSON1 into letting me use her iPhone to take pictures of @CAPS2 guy without him knowing. Now some people would think that that was kind of like a stalker, I just saw as a chance to brush up on my spy skills. After successfully getting a couple of pictures undetected, I decided to get just one more before we went back to the other side of the library to see @CAPS6 we had. I was just about to take the picture when I locked eyes with the guy who was not supposed to see me. We then had to abort the mission and crawl all the way to the other side of the library so he wasn't able to see us again, so that he couldn't confront us about why we were taking pictures of him. The funny thing is the pictures were not that good and that just shows how bad of a spy we actually were. Normally libraries are quiet, right? Well @PERSON1 and I had a little problem with people wanting the library to be to quiet. On one such occasion a nice looking middle aged women was doing some homework at a table not to far away form where we were sitting. We were watching some videos on @ORGANIZATION1's iPhone and we had the speakers on low. @CAPS2 lady told us very rudely that she wanted is to move somewhere else if we were going to have the volume up because she needed to get her work done. Not one please or thank you were said as we walked away. On a similar occasion an elderly lady who was sitting a few book shelves away form us also asked us to be quiet so that she could finish her book. @CAPS2 time the elderly lady used her manners but she had a very rude tone of voice. On both of these occasions @PERSON1 and I started laughing shortly afterward. @CAPS2 just goes to show how ""nice"" people can be when they want to get something done. All and all that @DATE1 was one of the most funniest summers I have ever had. Whether we were getting talked to by some guy who wanted to start a @CAPS3 line or getting caught trying to spy on a cute guy or even getting reprimanded by not so nice people, we could always find @CAPS1 somewhere. Not many people could say that the library was ever a place where they laughed so much they nearly peed there pants, but @PERSON1 and I can."	20	17		37				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3						
21522	8	" It was the middle of @DATE1 and I was ten, bored and constantly sleeping. Even at ten I still played with toys, and that was the highlight of most days. All of my friends from fifth grade were on vacation surfing in @LOCATION1, or roasting marshmallows over the roaring fire with their families at camp, while I was stuck at home with nothing to do. That was about to be the most boring @DATE1 break anyone has ever had until one day in @DATE3. The day I met @PERSON1 was the day I gained my best friend. I met @PERSON1 because of my brother and his sister, they had had crushes on each other and wanted to start dating. That was fine with our parents but, that also meant that her brother @PERSON1, and I, would have to tag along also. I remember the first day being so uncomfortable and stiff. I could tell he didn't like me, he only chuckled when I would crack a joke here an there. As time went on though, I must have grew on him, because a few days later he was laughing at practically every joke I made.  Those jokes had eventually led up to a friendship that would last a lifetime. Which really started when his birthday had come up in late @DATE2. He was having a small overnight birthday party which included me, his family, and his good friend @CAPS1. @CAPS1 couldn't stay overnight, so it was just me and @PERSON1. I didn't get much sleep at all that night, but that was fine with me because why i hadn't was a good enough reason not to.  We spent half the night talking, and laughing, and really just getting to know each other better. Anyone with eyes could see that we were becoming close friends. Even after our siblings separated from each other we would still hang out as just us two. The real test of our friendship took place shortly after his birthday when @PERSON1, and his family moved to @LOCATION2, where they were from. After they moved I still had contact with him and we talked to each other frequently. They had been gone for about a year when I got a call from @PERSON1, telling me that they were going to move back.  I had so many questions that needed to be answered, but he had a really bad connection and the call was dropped quickly after I heard him say that. With many things left unsaid my overall emotion was obviously happy, but also slightly confused. Was he really coming back? That was the question that kept me wondering. It was days after that I had gotten another call from him, and this time we actually had a chance to talk. It was true, he was coming back, but as it turns out not forever. @PERSON1 came back for about another solid @NUM1 years, having fun and being the best of friends, but his parents already wanted to move back to @LOCATION2 again. This time was different because he wasn't coming back. He was going to stay there, without a thought of going back. @PERSON1 had left my life as quickly as he entered. He's halfway across the country now, with new friends and a renewed life, probably laughing at a new friend's jokes."	20	18	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4
21526	8	" I have a friend and her name is @PERSON1. I have known her since we were both in the fifth grade and in the same class. We have been friends for about five to six years now and it has been a great friendship. About two years ago for her fifteenth bithday party she invited a couple of her friends and I to spend the day over at her dads house in @LOCATION1. The plan was to hang out, have fun ,and pretty much do whatever we wanted to do because it was her birthday. There was a pool to swim in, and flatscreen television to watch movies, plenty of board games top go around, and quite a few people to have a conversation with. On the morning of @DATE1 we all loaded up the car around noon and made our way to her dads appartment in @LOCATION1. A short @NUM1 minutes later we had arrived at the appartment complex. We were all so excited to get the entire day to hang out, and have an amazing sleepover for @ORGANIZATION1's birthday. The second that the van had stopped all five of the people that were in the car including me unbuckled our seat belts as fast as we could and got up out of the seats to head to the house. Everybody had gotten there seatbelt unbuckled except for @CAPS4 friend @PERSON2. She had thought she heard, and felt the seatbelt button click to release it, but it never disengaged. While the seat belt was still on she attempted to jump up out of her seat but at the last second the seatbelt caught her by the waste and jerked her back down to her spot. She had layed there with her arms to her sides with her head all the way back against the head rest and moaned for a good ten seconds. This was one of the many events of laughter that had happened that day.  A good two hours had gone by and the five of us were chillin' out in the living room and talking about what to do next. @PERSON1 had suggested ""@CAPS1 guys, we should all go to the pool for a couple of hours, swim, and tan."" The rest of us were all for it concidering the fact that it was probably one hundred degrees outside, the weather was super sunny, and clear, and because it was @CAPS2 @PERSON1 birthday, and she should be able to do whatever she wants. Then after the conversation we all got our swim suites on, grabbed our towls, and whatever else we needed for the pool, and headed out the door. Little did we know but the blacktop outside was boiling! Of course we were all barefoot because we were just going to go jump in the pool anyways. We all then took one step out on the blacktop, and all you could here was screaming, and yelling. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5! @CAPS4 feet are on fire!"" @PERSON2 remarked. We had all agreed with her at that very moment of time. Since the blacktop was outrageously hot @PERSON2 started running for the grass that was about two hundred feet away. I would say thirty seconds later @PERSON2 had finally reached the grass and all we heard was. ""@CAPS6!"" all of us looked up at @LOCATION2. She was laying flat on her back because the sprinklers had been on recently and she didnt know so her feet flew right out in front of her and landed on her back. We all started laughing but running at the same time. I helped @PERSON2 get up off of the ground and then we all continued our journey to the pool. I think you can guess that something else funny happened with @PERSON2."	20	19	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
21529	8	"                                  ""@CAPS1 @DATE1"" @CAPS2 my brother graduated @CAPS1 year it was a great time in our lives . We all were having fun daily because it was like my brother didn't have rules any more this made him a lot more fun to be around. At the beginning of the @DATE1 my brother and I were going fishing almost daily with our friends. It was a very fun for all of us. We all got to hang out and stay connected because there is nothing ells to do in our small town except for go to the lake and fish for bass.   @CAPS2 he graduated everyone close to the family gave him gifts like money or presents. My mother however couldn't decide what she wanted to get him. @CAPS2 she saw us always going up to the lake to go bass fishing she had an idea, she would send my brother and a couple of his friends on a fishing trip. My brother was very excited to here her plan. They spent many hours searching for a place for him and his friends to travel to. They decided on going into the deserts of @LOCATION1 to a huge lake to camp at.  I myself thought this was a very cool plan and i was happy for my brother. Little had I known my brother was planing on taking me with him. He told me his plans of who he would be taking a couple weeks before it was time to depart. I was so excited! My brother said we would be taking our friend @PERSON1 on the trip with us witch was cool because he is a fun person to be around. He was so so happy @CAPS2 we told him he was going because he loves bass fishing more than us.   Immediately @PERSON1 ran out to the garage to get his camping and fishing gear ready for the trip as did we @CAPS2 we got home that night. Two weeks later we all departed for a two week trip to the deserts of eastern @ORGANIZATION1. The first day we were in eastern @ORGANIZATION1 before we even found the place we were going to stay at we went to a huge reservoir to go fishing. @PERSON1 almost caught a huge @NUM1 inch bass however his line on his fishing rod broke. My brother and I laughed at him and he was mad.  We spent the first night on the side of the road in the near freezing dry @LOCATION1 air because we had accidentally gone a day early and our camp sight was occupied in the campground. We were unhappy about it at the time but now we look back on that night with great laughter. The next few days went by with much fun. We met some collage students from @ORGANIZATION1, they were very chill people to hang out with we all joined around the camp fire and told jokes. We laughed for probably a half an hour @CAPS2 one of the guys told us about some funny collage party things that had happened. @CAPS1 @DATE1 was a very interesting @DATE1 that was full of laughter and joy.

21532	8	" ""@CAPS1 days are diamonds and @CAPS1 days are stone,"" are the famous, melodic words of @LOCATION1. He was absolutely right and the day of @DATE1, was a very stony day. It began when I woke up late, having stayed up until eleven o'clock the night before in order to finish my homework. As I hurriedly pulled a sweater over my head, I ran downstairs and out the door, to school. Running under the dreary gray clouds, I suddenly remembered the geometry test that was scheduled for today. By my seventh period geometry class, the sleep deprivation was kicking in and my head was pounding. Of course, this had to be the day that @PERSON1 decided to cheat off my test. As his eyes swept over my paper for the third time, I sighed and stared pointedly at his own paper. I should have simply shifted in my seat so he could not see my test, but I wanted him to get the point. @PERSON2, however, seemed to think I was cheating off of @PERSON1. I took the reprimands silently and went to my locker. After collecting my belongings, I turned to go home. A loud ripping noise caught my attention and I realized, with a groan, that I had just torn my sweater on the corner of my locker. Without acknowledging the stares of my peers, I turned and ran out into the pouring rain. Once I had reached my quiet road, I could not contain myself. With my face turned towards the stony sky, I shouted until I my throat felt like sandpaper. I had never had any sort of emotional breakdown before and the feeling was strange and alien to me. I hoped that no one would ever see me like that, as I had transformed into a stranger, hurt and lost. Following my explosion, I trudged slowly home and entered the house to find my @NUM1-year-old sister, @PERSON3, begging me for macaroni and cheese. I sighed and put a pot of water on the stove. Maybe it was cruel fate or possibly just stupidity, but either way I ended up with half a pot of steaming water spilled down the front of my body. Granted, it was not very hot, as I had just put it on the stove, but all I could do was sit down on the cold kitchen floor, put my head in my hands, and cry. My sobs sounded like a frog croaking. I looked up suddenly, however, when I felt a small hand tapping my shoulder. ""@CAPS2?"" @PERSON3 asked tentavely. ""@CAPS3 did the dog say to the cat?"" I just stared at her with leaking eyes. ""@CAPS4 are a cat-astrophe,"" she answered herself. A small smile was set on her pink lips as she started giggling. Then I started giggling, too, which led to uncontrollable laughter. It was a ridiculously humorless joke, but the laughter felt like cold water running over the painful burns the day had forced upon me. There we sat, a giggling little girl and a messy, laughing teenager, sitting on their kitchen floor on a very grey day. One little joke, with just one fit of laughter, had transformed my entirely stoney day into a perfect little diamond."	25	25		50				5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5

Here is an example in which laughter brought my boyfriend and I together. I had been crushing on the same guy, @PERSON1, for two months. I was way too nervous to speak to him. One day my friends and I were walking down the hall where he happened to be. When i saw him I tried to turn around and walk the other way, but my friends pulled me back. They then told me they heard from a ""little bird"" he liked me too, so we continued to walk in his direction. We stopped walking right in front of him and my friends pushed me into him then ran off. I told him sorry as I turned bright red. My best friends had set me up. We stood there for five minutes in an awkward silence. All I did was stare into his beautiful blue eyes. All i could think about was how hot he looked in his black wrestling shirt and his faded blue jeans. He probably thought i was a freak. He had been leaning against the wall standing mostly on his right leg. Then when he went to switch to his left leg he let out the biggest fart i have ever heard. We started laughing. After we had settled down from laughing hysterically, we started talking. We ended up talking for two hours. A couple weeks had gone by and we had been talking more and more each day. Another week had flew by and we went to our first movie. I called @CAPS2 our first date. That night he asked me to be his girlfriend. I of course said yes. Ever since the day he farted I have thanked @CAPS5 for @CAPS2. I wouldn't have him as my boyfriend if @CAPS2 weren't for him braking the ice with his embarrassing moment. Most of all I thank my friends for shoving me into him that day. There could not have been a better way to meet a guy. This is just one example of laughter and how much @CAPS2 @CAPS3 change or affect a situation. Laughter is the medicines of all medicines. @CAPS2 is one of the most important tools a person @CAPS3 have."	20	18	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4
21542	8	" Laughter is what I'd like to call a ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @CAPS3"". Because no matter what language or tongue you speak, when something funny occurs, the natural reaction is to laugh. This reaction is present for all people, and when it takes place; it's contagious and helps to bring everyone together. Laughter also emits a sense of happiness and joy, which in return makes people feel more free and open to join in and laugh as well. In many instances, if there is an awkward situation at hand, laughter plays a big role in lightening the mood; and making the atmosphere a little more comfortable. In @DATE1 laughter was a big key in the success of our annual @ORGANIZATION1.  Our @ORGANIZATION1 consists of around @NUM1 people (including cousins, and some close friends); so as you can see it @MONTH1 not be easy to get to know and interact with everyone. However, at dinner time we like to switch it up, and sit next to relatives that you wouldn't normally sit next to. At first, it's usually very awkward, and sometimes even frightening for the younger kids, when they end up to sitting next to our very loud and opinionated aunts and uncles. That is until my @LOCATION1 decides to crack one of his hilarious jokes.  My @LOCATION1 is somewhat of a @CAPS4 of awkwardness. Not necessarily that he enjoys being in awkward situations, but rather that he enjoys watching them play out. Eventually about halfway through the meal, after eating in close to utter silence; he decides to stand up and give a little toast to the @ORGANIZATION1. Following the speech, he always concludes with a well rehearsed joke; which, gets everyone laughing. Some of the younger cousins don't always understand the play on words. But what really gets them going, is listening to all of our aunts and uncles hoot and holler things like ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6"" and ""@CAPS7 help me"" mixed in with their obnoxious laughs. After all the fun dies down, the awkwardness always seems to drift away, leaving us with the feelings of happiness and joy that I described earlier. I believe that those feelings directly correlate to lightening the mood, and in helping to get everyone more comfortable with who they happen to be sitting by. Once all these things occur, conversation gets flowing and everyone ends up getting to know a @ORGANIZATION1 member, that they otherwise might have not gotten the chance to truly meet. Laughter is one of the keys to happiness in life; because without it, life would be very dull and boring. Laughter also has the power to change situations, and to make them better for the most part.  In @DATE1, laughter changed a situation in my life for the better, just like it has done so many times since then. In my eyes, laughter is the best @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 out there. If you really want to get to know a person, all you have to do is make them laugh!"	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21545	8	"          Making jokes or just talking about funny stuff and laughing with people can make conversations comfortable and lets people see your true self . In my opinion.                         Laughing is one of the most important things you should have in a relationship with someone because you need to keep having fun and laughing about funny things. Laughing also make you feel close too people because once you and that person get to know each other you'll just laugh about anything even if its not that funny.For example when i first meet people i am very shy, I don't really say much but if the person that i am talking to makes me laugh, it makes me feel comfortable and makes me want to joke around with them, it makes the conversation fun.  If there is no laughter in a relationship the relationship is practically dead. No one wants to be around a person with no sense of humor. In my opinion everyone has a funny side, some people like to show it and some people like to keep it to themselves. Some people might be funnier but the things is we can all be funny in our own way.  I've had many experiences where laughing has benefited my relationship with people. Me and my friend met in middle school ,I was good friends with his sister but i never really got to know him until I went to high school. I had a lot of classes with him so i started talking to him, but because i already knew him I wasn't very shy. The first day that I talked to him at school he was making fun of me but not an a mean he was joking around how I brought chocolates to his house and I didn't offer him any , it was more of like an inside joke. The thing is our relationship started off with us laughing and joking around. So I immediately felt like i could be my self around my new friend and not worry about what he would think. Now we are best of friends,we laugh about everything and we have are own little inside jokes.When I am talking to my friend I can say anything that I think is funny and I know he will laugh at it. Laughter has really made my friendship with my friend fun. One of the best relationships I have with a person is with my sister and its because we just laugh all the time when we are together . When either of us is going through a ruff time we still find a way to make each other laugh and forget about all our problems for a while. Even though we are sisters and we naturally have a bond, laughter just makes are sisterly bond ten times better. We have very similar personalities, and we are both pretty funny so the laughing never stops between us there is always something we laugh about.  Laughing in my opinion is very important to have in a relationship, without laughter it would be a miserable, unhappy relationship. Laughing brings out the good side of people in most cases, it brings out truth in people. when you first meet people, laughing really makes conversation comfortable and not awkward. Starting a relationship with laughter can really make you good friends for example like my friendship with my friend. When you are sad or mad,it really makes you feel better when you have someone that makes you laugh it just makes everything better it really can change some peoples mood and make them forget about the negative stuff in their life for a while. Laughter is just a great way to bond with people. Having someone to laugh with is just very important to have in life."	20	18	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3

I was just wearing my uniform my aunt said bye as I did. but out of the deep blue shy a big black rain cloud comes out.

21570	8	"Laughter A true story that involves @CAPS4 and laughter was when i was hanging out with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERSON1, and her fiance @PERSON4 (who is a profesional quad racer) at a @ORGANIZATION1 concert in @LOCATION2. The concert was the best concert i have ever been to and probably the best one i will ever go to because @ORGANIZATION1 is my favorite band. They even played the song that made them, its called @CAPS3 @CAPS4. When we were there the music was really loud and a bunch of people were drinking and getting drunk and doing stupid stuff. Like this one guy who was standing behind his girlfriend who was sitting down in the grass, this guy had a few too many to drink. He was standing behind his girlfriend laughing at a joke that oneof his drunk buddies told him and then he leans on his girlfriend but just falls on her and folds her right in half like a lawn chair. My @CAPS1 and @CAPS4 started laughing, it was pretty funny. But then the guys girlfriend got up and walked out of the stadium so he got pretty sad. The rest of the concert was pretty funny. The front rows seats were only for people over @NUM1 because during the concert the band would bring out some beer guns and shower the front rows with beer. The front rows were the craziest rows. The back rows were pretty crazy too, people were smoking marijuiana in the back rows, but we werent. When we left we all smelled like weed and didnt want to get pulled over for any reason and have the cop think that we were drugies. It was a long ride home, we live in @LOCATION3, @ORGANIZATION2 and we drove to @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2 and back in one day. I was so tired, we didnt even take any chairs to the concert so we had to stand up in the same spot for about @NUM2 hours. But it was all worth it to see my favorite band in concert. They had a few other bands before them that were also great. Bands like; @PERSON2, @CAPS5/@CAPS6, and @CAPS7. So it was deffinetly the best concert I have ever been to. The second best concert ive ever been to was a @CAPS8 concert in @LOCATION1 with my @CAPS9 @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 @PERSON1 during the @CAPS10 @CAPS11. There were a lot of things we did before the concert like; look at animals, eat, go on rides, buy things, eat more, get drinks, and walk around the @CAPS11. A lot of things made @CAPS4 laughlike when my @PERSON1 stepped in horse and goat poop and when my mom dropped her food on her lap. The concert was really cool, they played some songs to there new album @CAPS12 and @CAPS13. It wasnt as long as the drive to the @ORGANIZATION1 concert and it wasnt as good. But it was still awesome."	16	15		31				3	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	4	3	3	3						
21581	8	" Laughter to me seems like the foundation of a relationship; if it is a relationship with your parents, best-friend, or your spouse, it can all be formed with a single laugh or giggle. I have seen on @CAPS1 that when a guy try's to ""pick up"" or ""hit on"" a girl, most of the time he will try to be funny to ""break the ice"". When that so called ""ice"" is broken the air is open for both people to start showing each who they are.  My best friend and I have been friends for five years now and I hope that we will be friends for more years to come. @PERSON1 (my best friend/and only friend) has shown me how to be myself @PERCENT1, with her and try to with others. Together @PERSON1 and I have had many funny adventures together, that I will cherish for the rest of my life. Just recently @PERSON1 and I went snowboarding at @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION2. @CAPS3 was her second time going snowboarding and I have been snowboarding for about three years now. I promised her that I would stay and help her on the slopes until she got the hang of the board under her feet, I also promised that I would fall down with her when she fell. When we got there I showed her how to clip her bindings on, what the stomp pad was used for, and also how to skate. The word skate means that your foot boot is in the front binding and your left foot is not, you push your back foot on the snow to slide or skate on to the ski lift. It took us three hours to get down the first bunny hill slope, normally it takes a person no more than ten minutes to get down. While teaching, laughing , and bonding with @PERSON1 I noticed that when I laugh with her I get feelings of love, caring, and happiness. Laughing with her always makes my day. In fact that is how we became friends; was by laughing together. After we got of the slope she said some words to me that I will not forget, ""@CAPS2 you are the best friend I could ever ask for, if you were a man I would marry you and have your children, I love you."" @CAPS3 meant a lot to me, for @PERSON1 is the kind of person that keeps her feelings of love and caring inside. @CAPS3 was the first time she has ever said she loves me. Laughing together for five years now has made it so that @PERSON1 feels more open with me, enough to say something that she never told to her family. Laughing and even giggling together is what @PERSON1 and I look forward to in our relationship. "	20	18	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3
21586	8	" When I think of laughter you think of memories you shared with people. When I was about six my family and I went to my cousins ranch in @ORGANIZATION1. The happest time started with us pulling up to the house as I slowly open my eyes from the long car ride seeing the porch light on. I quickly grabbed up all my toys and some playing cards and waited eagerly at the door for some to answer while the rest of my family are getting the suitcases. My @CAPS1 @CAPS2 came to the door first to greet us. I walk under his arm to set down my toys in the living room when I saw @PERSON1 sleeping on the coach. He was my best friend in the whole world and I always looked forward to seeing him everythime. He had brown hair always wearing wranglers with a trucker hat and his plad tucked in shirt. We always played gold fish together every time I came over, any time of the day. I was so excited to see him I started to run twards him when my other cousin @PERSON2 grabs me and starts to tickle me tell I fell on the floor and was screaming of laughter. My laughing woke up @PERSON1 as he came running to me picked me up off the ground and saved me from @LOCATION1. He put me on the couch and started watching @CAPS3 tell I feel asleep.  The next morning I woke up to hear cyotes howling outside while the sun was coming up, when I smelt bacon and eggs coming from the kitchenI shot up to eat breakfast. My dad and all the boys went out to go goose hunting on the farm. Around lunch time while my mom and @PERSON3 were cooking up some hamburgers the boys all came back in time for lunch. Lunch wasn't ready right then so @PERSON1 and I startded to play gold fish tell we were told it was time to eat. After lunch we went out to the hay barns to find all the rattle snakes and bull snakes curld up by the bales. Almost every foot step we took there was another snake curld up in the bales. Every time @PERSON1 would tell me to jump back to shoot the snake in the head. After hunting @PERSON1 figured we needed a laugh so he grabbed a bull snake and we started to walk to the back yard. I wasn't to sure what he was doing tell we got in the back yard and @PERSON3 jumped out of her chair and started running to the house. Everyone started to laugh when @PERSON1 cut her off and she was running in a circle in the back yard. @PERSON1 finally let her go in the house after about five minutes of giving her a heart attack. We all came back inside to visite in the house. @PERSON1 and I headed to play more gold fish at the table for the last time of my visit.  The next morning we woke up at five to start working on the farm. I went back to sleep in the tractor tell they were done. When we were done we started loading up all are clothes in the car and gave everyone a hug good bye as I stood by @PERSON1 not wanting to leave but my mom said I couldn't stay so she picked me up and put me in the car. As we pulled away I looked back to see them all waving good bye.  After we visited @DATE1 we got a call from my @CAPS4 @PERSON3 with some bad news. @PERSON2 was heading home and saw @CAPS5 truck on the road but when he pulled up he saw that he killed himself two weeks before he graduated. We went to the funeral that @DATE2 and when it was all done I sat in @CAPS5 room and only could remember all the laughs we shared. I knew to always laugh and always to remember the great times I had with one true my best friend. My memory of him hasn't gone away after all these years and because of him I always laugh when I can laugh and live to the fullest. He taught me so much from the little time he was he but whenever I need a laugh I think of the last time I saw him."	18	21		39				4	4	4	4	4	3	5	4	5	5	4	4						
21599	8	" I sat at the table, speechless, as they told me their story. The @CAPS1 had been through a lot in the past seven years. @PERSON1's youngest son was born three weeks early and the doctor told her he would only live for three days at the most. As she told me, she stared off into the distance as if she were reliving the moment. She told me that her baby, @PERSON2, had a rare disease. Half of his brain was smooth, instead of the the normal rigid. She told me about those first days and how scared she was. Seeing @PERSON2 next her was the only thing that kept me from bursting into tears. He had lived longer. @PERSON1 told me about how as @PERSON2 grew older he couldn't walk. His pediatrician told her that @PERSON2 would never be able to take his first steps and would have to live life confined in a wheel chair. @PERSON2 was given another miracle. He walked. With the aide of a camouflage cane he beat the odds once again. @PERSON1 told me about how @PERSON2 couldn't talk. He only speaks through sign language. She also taught me how to take care of him. He was a normal kid who liked to play with cars and @CAPS2. He wasn't any different then the rest of the kids. This was going to be a roller coaster of a week.  I had only met the @CAPS1 early that @TIME1 when they had arrived to @CAPS4 @CAPS5, a @DATE1 @CAPS4 for disabled kids. I had only known them for a few hours and they were telling me their life story. I got the next week to become best friends with @PERSON2. We went swimming in the river, played with sticks, went on nature walks, even rode a horse. The smile on @ORGANIZATION1's face lit up my day every time I saw it. @PERSON2 got to experience things that a child of his kind would never be able to in a lifetime. We got to go tubing, ride on jet skis, and fish in a stock pond where we were sure to catch something. Having the best time of our lives we parted each night to bed, him in his cabin, and I in my tent. Each night as I left I could hear the family laughing and talking about how great the day was and how much fun we were having. To be a part of making a child happy was the cherry on top of my @CAPS4 experience. One event in particular from @CAPS4 that week will always stay close to my heart. @PERSON2 had been experimenting around on a tricycle made specifically for children with disabilities. He tried for hours to make it go. No matter how hard her tried he couldn't move. My heart broke when I saw him start to cry. He was so frustrated. @PERSON2 gave up and moved on to the swings instead. The rest of the day was filled with the look of sorrow and frustration on his face. I wanted to fix it. I had to fix it. He needed to be happy. That night I went to our @CAPS4 directer, @PERSON3, and I told him about what had happened and he brought me to the garage. The garage was so chaotic and unorganized. I didn't quite understand what he was doing until he emerged with a brand new shiny bike. One with foot straps and supportive seat complete with dragons, and a bell. It was the perfect thing. I was so excited to let @PERSON2 try it out in the @TIME1. The next @TIME1, after a delicious blueberry pancake breakfast, we set off to try out the new toy. This moment was big for @PERSON2 and his parents. He was told he'd never walk, or ever be able to ride a bike, or talk. He had lived through miracles before. He could do it again. @PERSON3 strapped @PERSON2 on the bike, put a helmet on him and started him off. The anticipation was almost too much. After a few seconds passed, the wheels began to turn. @PERSON2 was riding a bike. Tears streamed down our faces, this was the greatest moment of @ORGANIZATION1's life. The way he smiled and laughed at his new found capability was a great sight. To be part of something so special was an honor. @PERSON2 rode his bike all around @CAPS4 that day. He even rode it into his cabin, and continued to ride in circles around his bunk. I left the family to enjoy their night and went off to bed myself.  The rest of the week was filled with a great deal of fun, but when the end came the goodbyes were hard. We didn't want to leave each other. I had become part of @LOCATION1's family, they trusted me and I felt at home with them. @PERSON2 and I were new best friends and couldn't wait until the next @DATE1 when we would meet again at @CAPS4 @CAPS5 where we could do it all over, and make new memories."	25	22		47				5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	4	4						
21606	8	"One time I was at my friend @PERSON1's house, and her dog @PERSON3 was going crazy. She would run up and down the stairs as fast as she could and no one had any idea why. I thought it was so funny, but @PERSON1 was getting super mad at @PERSON3. So eventually @ORGANIZATION1 into her room to see if she would calm down, but to her dismay @PERSON3 did not. She was running hot laps back and forth all around the room and the more she did that the harder I laughed. It was like the most funniest thing I have ever experienced in my life. This dog had obviously gotten a hold of some kind of energy source to be this happen. Yet we still couldn't figure out what it was, but @PERSON3 was on a sugar high or something. So @PERSON1 and I went down stairs to see if her mom @CAPS1 knew why @PERSON3 was acting so ridiculous. She had no clue. So then we went and asked her dad @PERSON2, and he was convinced the dog was just crazy. Obviously the dog had some issues, but that wasn't the problem because @PERSON3 never usually acted this hyper before. Then @CAPS2, @PERSON1's sister came down stairs and told us to shut the dog up, but we couldn't. @PERSON3 was running to fast to catch her and was way to crazy to try and calm her down. So we took @PERSON3 back in @ORGANIZATION1's room and just laughed and laughed because there was nothing else to do but to sit there and wonder what the heck was wrong with this dog. To be honest, we never did find out what was wrong with @PERSON3, she was just insanely hyper and out of this world that @TIME1. So after @PERSON3 had calmed down about @NUM1 hours later, @PERSON1 and I went on a walk. We were with her friend @PERSON4 and I was trying to explain to him the story of how @PERSON3 went crazy that @TIME1 and they didn't find it as funny as me. I thought it was the most hilarious thing I have ever seen in my life! And while I was explaining it to him, they had warned me I was about to trip over a curb, but I was laughing way to hard to notice and I fell. That was like the icing on the cake of @TIME1. I just sat there on the ground and laughed, and so did they. It was pretty funny! I haven't laughed that hard since then. The end."	20	16		36				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	3						
21613	8	" Before my best friend moved away, we would stay up at night just laughing for no reason at all. I don't know what would get us started, but it would not stop until our stomachs hurt so bad from laughing that we just fell asleep. On these nights, her mom would come in around @TIME1 and ask us nicely to please quiet down, which just made us laugh more. When we are together, it is quite dangerous to be around. We have gotten so close that we are practically sisters in a way. Laughter is important in all of my relationships. I grew up in a large family where laughter is key, and positive attitudes were expected.  Over the @DATE1, @CAPS1 and I work together, so we have lots of time to get our thinking on the same track. If we are on a short car ride and we want to go somewhere, we make it happen. We are very good at manipulating our elders, a skill acquired from years of practicing on @CAPS2. All it takes is one look to see what the other is plotting, then a laugh will follow, letting the manipulated know that it is doomed, or very soon to be. Our schemes are generally harmless, possibly just a little side ache from being tickled too hard. It does not help that we are both small, strong, and packed full of energy, just waiting for the right person to come along. @CAPS1 and I find ways to stir up mischief all around us, whether it be jumping out from behind corners or taking the manager's keys.  When I go somewhere, I am generally aiming for positive places with an upbeat atmosphere and people that make me happy. I dislike and avoid places I don't enjoy, I am one to make jokes or be sarcastic when things are too quiet or too serious. Serious environments intimidate me, @CAPS6 are out of my comfort zone. Laughter brings people together, and it lightens people's moods. Nobody likes the awkward situations where no one is saying anything, so I generally will break the silence with a blond joke or something.  I was flying home to @ORGANIZATION2 from @LOCATION3, @CAPS3 and met a couple great people on the way. When I boarded the plane I looked around for a place to sit then decided on the seat between an elderly woman and a man who resembled my father (I was alone on the flight). I thought, for the next hour I will be with these people, so I had better make it something to remember. The man had helped me get my carry-on into the overhead storage, which was very nice of him. The elderly woman and I started talking, and the subject of horses came up, and when horses come up in conversion, @CAPS6 are usually paired with lots of falling stories. She talked about this @CAPS4 horse called @CAPS4 @CAPS5, how he had a mind of his own, and how he would do things his way. The problem with horses is this: @CAPS6 know that @CAPS6 are a slight deal bigger than us, and can really do as @CAPS6 please, but most choose to listen as @CAPS6 don't like to be corrected. I told about my first few rides, and how I didn't know much besides how to steer the massive animal beneath me. Before we knew it, we were landing in @LOCATION1, and my new friends got off the plane.  When my plane landed in @LOCATION1, I figured I would be flying to @ORGANIZATION2 sitting alone. After a few minutes, a teenage girl got on and sat next to me. The first thing she did was offer me a piece of gum, which I accepted. The first bit of the ride was quiet, but after awhile the crying baby got annoying to listen to so we started talking. She was flying to @LOCATION2 to her dad's house. We talked about our families and hobbies, and had a good time. After we flew into @ORGANIZATION1, I welcomed myself back home, I was back in the eternal rain state, and couldn't see anything besides clouds out of my window. Laughter is all around us, and there are always things to laugh about, look on the bright side of life. People are more attracted to those who can make them laugh, so get a sense of humor and you will be in good company. Giggles and smiles make the world go around, so keep laughing.

21615	8	"                              @ORGANIZATION1                                    @DATE1 for my @CAPS1 birthday we went to @ORGANIZATION1 for a week, @CAPS16 was so much fun when we got there but the drive was not fun at all. When we got to the house that @TIME1 is was so beautiful the snow was falling and @CAPS16 was coming down so hard @CAPS16 looked like white cotton balls and the snow on the house was just amazingly marvelous I mean @CAPS16 seriously looked like @CAPS16 could have belonged in a story book as a princess castle. When we got in the house @CAPS16 was really relaxed and nobody really wanted to do anything we all pretty much fell asleep on the couch.  The next morning when we woke up we were all eating breakfast and watching the snow @DATE2, there was a knock on the door, so of course I had to @CAPS9 get @CAPS16 because my @CAPS17 was ""too tired"" so i got up and went and opened the the door and three huge boys came in and picked me up now at first i was like ""@CAPS2 who are these boys?"" but then after they took their hoods off i noticed @CAPS16 was my cousin @PERSON1, his best friend @PERSON2 and his other friend @CAPS3. So they carried me back to the table and sat me down and @CAPS16 was funny because my whole @CAPS17 was laughing so hard they couldn't breathe and i still had a horrified look on my face.  They yelled""@CAPS4"" and then went out back and started building snow ramps to snowboard off of. So i got dressed and went out back with them and at first they were like ""@CAPS5 great she is out here"". And they usually give me a lot of attention but they weren't so i decided i needed more attention so when they weren't looking i went and sat down and the snowboard ramp the had built and of course @PERSON2 knew why i was doing @CAPS16 but @CAPS3 and @PERSON1 were still clueless so of course they told me to get off but i told them ""@CAPS7"" and that irritated them so @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS8 girl if you don't move i am going to jump over you"", well of course i was super mad at this point and wanted to see if he would actually do @CAPS16 so i told him ""@CAPS9 ahead"" @PERSON1 started to @CAPS9 but then @PERSON2 grabbed him,@CAPS10 him off the snowboard and started yelling at him @CAPS11 the time the whole argument was over, witch @CAPS11 the way lasted almost the whole day. I went to bed @TIME1 and @PERSON1@NUM1 and @CAPS3 went to the bar and the next morning I was told to sleep in but i was woken up at seven o'clock @CAPS11 @PERSON2 and @CAPS3 screaming at @PERSON1 to get up but they didn't get him up they got me up I was so mad I felt like a mama bear who just got woken up in the middle of hibernation. @CAPS16 was so irritating to be a house with three hungover twenty-one @DATE1 old's but i had fun anyways, That @TIME1 they were not home @CAPS14 god but with them not there is was peace and quiet so we played @CAPS15 and @LOCATION3, @CAPS16 was so much fun we had a blast. The next morning wasn't all that fun because we had another @CAPS17, @CAPS18 us. I swear i was so irritated I wanted to pounce on them like and angry tiger getting ready to catch her prey. So i tried to stay away as much as possible, witch was kind of hard because they all love me but i just decided to lock myself in my room for the day to avoid them, @CAPS16 kind of sucked but @CAPS16 was a lot better than having them yell in my ear every five seconds. The day after we cleaned and started getting ready to leave, @CAPS16 was not fun at all but my @CAPS17 made sure i was cleaning and we ate three meals and after every meal we cleaned again but that @TIME1 we went to bed and you didn't hear a peep out of anybody because we were so tired but the next morning we left at seven o'clock and started driving back to @LOCATION2 @CAPS16 was so fun being at @LOCATION1 we have made @CAPS16 a tradition but we weren't able to @CAPS9 this @DATE1 because of winter formal but we are definitely going back this @DATE1 and we will have twice as much fun as we did two ears ago!"	15	17		32				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3						
21618	8	" A while back my mom had decided to send me to @DATE3 camp. When I heard this I was pretty upset, @CAPS1 I wouldn't know anyone there. Before camp started I did all I could to let my mom not let me go. After a while of that I knew I wouldn't get my way, and before I knew it I was off to camp. When I got to the place that was taking us to camp, there wasn't a lot of people there.  When I got to the camp I was wrong, there was a lot of people that I didn't know. It was extremely scary, but it was to late to go home now. Walking to my cabin was nerve racking, @CAPS1 I didn't know who would be in my cabin. Meeting the girls in my cabin was awkward, mainly @CAPS1 we didn't know each other and secondly our counselor was so weird. Right after meeting each other our counselor made all of us play a game of @CAPS2. Playing @CAPS2 at first with strangers was strange, but after a while we started laughing. We played and laughed for hours and hours, until it was time for lunch. Lunch with the girls was not so scary since we had so muh fun playing @CAPS2, but we still didn't really know each other.  When lunch was over the first thing we did was play @CAPS2, the more we laughed and had fun the more and more we started to get to know each other. All @DATE1 we played the silly little game of @CAPS2, and just giggled and laughed. @DATE2 came along the second @DATE1 of camp and all of us had almost become friend by just laughing and playing @CAPS2. We played it so much the first @DATE1 that we just called it ""@CAPS6 @CAPS2"" instead of @CAPS2. Like other things we got tired of @CAPS2 and went our separate ways for free time. Everyone agreed that free time that @DATE1 was so boring so we played @CAPS2 again. Laughing and laughing till our stomachs hurt from laughing so hard, that I think was the @DATE1 all of us really became friends.  We had become thick as thieves in just a couple of days, we did everything together. We talked,we swam, we played tennis, and most importantly we laughed together. Camp was not what I expected it to be, it was way better. All the girls in my cabin had become friends so fast that it was strange to other people,not realy but it was kind of weird to become best friends in just a couple of days. Camp was flying by for us and before we all knew it it was almost the @DATE1. Things were so good, until one of us got sick. I was the one who ended up sick, it was horrible I stayed in bed all @DATE1 missing everything that was going on. Even worse I had almost lost my voice, laying in bed without laughing with my friends and having fun was just torture. @DATE4 the @DATE1 of camp was fastly approaching, and all I could do was stay in bed. @DATE4 was there, but it was a relief when I could talk again. The rest of the @DATE1 @DATE1 of camp I could be out of bed and enjoying camp.  When @DATE1 time was ending and evening was arriving, we had our cabin party. Our party was so much fun, even though we had to stay inside our cabin. We ate all of our treats we saved from the concession stand, and all of the treats our counselor brought. It was almost @TIME1 so we had to go to bed soon, @CAPS1 we where leaving in the @TIME2. There was one @DATE1 thing we had to do, and it was one @DATE1 game of @CAPS2. We played for about in hour, @CAPS1 another counselor had to come tell us to be quiet.  Looking back at my first year of camp, I always remember how all of us became friends. We still talk about it every year at camp, and we do still play @CAPS2. That year at camp I think is one at my favorite memories, @CAPS1 we all became friends by just playing @CAPS2 and laughing together."	20	19	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
21629	8	"When you laugh, is @CAPS5 out of habit, or is @CAPS1 cause? What are the causes for laughing? Is @CAPS1 even such a thing as a ""cause"" for laughter? I'm sure that if you were to get a scientist's opinion, you would be given an in-depth, technical explanation for the cause of laughter; but does that mean that laughing is simply a message sent from the brain to the required muscles? Certainly not! The true cause is what was said or done to cause the brain to send the message to the required muscles to physically make a person laugh. So what makes people laugh? A funny joke, a senseless action, a misunderstanding? @CAPS5 can be anything! Without a doubt, one thing that makes people laugh is having a delightful time with a friend or two. @DATE1, @CAPS3 older sister @PERSON4 and I unknowingly went out on an adventure. We were headed to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 to visit our very best friends, @PERSON2 and @PERSON3, who happened to be almost completely identical to @CAPS3 sister and I in personality; @PERSON2 being like @PERSON4 and @PERSON3 being like me. Now, whenever the four of us got together, @CAPS1 was no telling what kind of humorous and insane memories we would all go home with; all we knew was that hanging out together @CAPS8 failed to brighten up our days and put a smile on our faces. This particular day, both @PERSON3 and I were in desperate need of each other's full attention and up-lifting spirits. She and I had both been going through a rough patch with some friends at our schools (oddly enough, we were both having friendship issues with someone named @PERSON1, and we didn't even go to the same school), so after some discussion between both of our sets of parents, they agreed to have @PERSON2 pick up @LOCATION3, @PERSON4 pick me up, and well all meet somewhere to take our minds off the antagonizing situations were were both suffering through. We decided to meet in @LOCATION2, at @PERSON2 and @PERSON3's house. When we pulled into their drive way, I could feel @CAPS3 body being filled with excitement, as if the emotion was trapped inside some kind of storage container inside of me that was too small to hold all the contents that were being held inside. Before the car engine was completely turned off, @CAPS3 seat belt was off and I was half-way out of the car door. I slammed @CAPS5 shut once @CAPS3 body had slithered its way free and ran for the door. To @CAPS3 surprise, @CAPS5 was unlocked! I pushed @CAPS5 open obnoxiously yelling, ""I'm heeeeeeeereeeeeeee!"" @CAPS1 was a cry of laughter that filled the room. I hugged both of them in one tight squeeze, and almost as if @PERSON3 and I had our very next move planned out, we immediately began chattering about the incidents that had occured that day as we took a seat on the couch. All that could be heard was, ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4! I have to tell you what happened today!"" and "" I can't believe she said that!"" or ""...and she said...and then I was like...so then she says...""@CAPS5 was just as if we had taken up the life of a drama-ridden teen straight out of the movies. Things were going as they normally would have; @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 dwelling close to @PERSON3 and I in the dining room locatated at the far end of the couch where she and I sat, still completely involved in our similar freshman-year-of-high school worlds. They were completely immersed in their own conversations of old memories we'd had together. All of a sudden @PERSON2 shouts, ""@CAPS2! @PERSON3 and I baked you brownies!"" @CAPS7 off guard by his intejection, we all once again fell into laughter, although this time, making our way toward the kitchen in search of said brownies. When we arrived, @CAPS1 sat a pan of brownies on the middle counter. @PERSON3 uncovered @CAPS5 and gave us each a napkin with which a brownie sat on top. We stood together, leaning against the tile counters, enjoying our brownies and the company of one another. Suddenly, @CAPS1 was a dull moment; no one was saying anything. As if to fill the silence before a timer ran out, @PERSON2 blurted out, ""@PERSON4, do you wear a wig?"" @CAPS8 in our lives have any of us laughed as hard as we did at that moment. @PERSON3 fell to the ground, @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 were leaning upon each other for support to keep from falling, and I was completely doubled over, trying desperately to keep the sip of milk I had just taken inside of @CAPS3 mouth. Minutes creeped by, and we were still laughing at the off-key remark. To this day, @PERSON4 and I remenise upon that afternoon and the laughter that was shared upon us and our very, very best friends. "	20	26	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	6	5	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4
