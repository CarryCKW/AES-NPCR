16	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The computer blinked to life and an image of a blonde haired girl filled the screen. It was easy to find out how life was in @LOCATION2, thanks to the actual @CAPS1 girl explaining it. Going to the library wouldn't have filled one with this priceless information and human interection. Computers are a nessessity of life if soceity wishes to grow and expand. They should be supported because they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and allow people to talk to others online. Firstly, computers help teach hand eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is a useful ability that is usod to excel in sports. In a recent survey, @PERCENT1 of kids felt their hand eye coordination improves after computer use. Even a simple thing like tying can build up this skill. Famous neurologist @CAPS2 @PERSON1 stated in an article last week that, ""@CAPS3 and computer strength the @CAPS2. When on the computer, you automatically process what the eyes see into a command for your hands."" @CAPS4 hand eye coordination can improve people in sports such as baseball and basketball. If someone wan't to become better in these sports, all they'd need to do was turn on the computer. Once people become better at sports, they're more likely to play them and become more healthy. In reality, computers can help with exercising instead of decreasing it. Additionaly, computers allow people to access information about faraway places and people. If someone wanted to reasearch @LOCATION1, all they'd need to do was type in a search would be presented to them in it would link forever to search through countless things. Also, having the ability to learn about cultures can make peole peole and their cultures, they understand others something. Increase tolerance people are. Computers are a resourceful tool that they can help people in every different aspect of life. Lastly, computer and in technology can allow people to chat. Computer chat and video chat can help the all different nations. Bring on good terms places other than can help us understand story comes out about something that happend in @LOCATION3, people can just go on their computer and ask an actual @LOCATION3 citizen their take on the matter. Also, video chat and online conversation can cut down on expensive phone bills. No one wants to pay more than they have to in this economy. Another good point is that you can acess family members you scaresly visit. It can help you connect within your own family more. Oviously, computers are a useful aid in todays era. their advancements push the world foreward to a better place. Computers can help people because they help teach handeye coordination, give people the bility to learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with others. Think of a world with no computers or technologicall advancements. The world would be sectored and unified, contact between people scare, and information even. The internet is like thousands or librarys put together. Nobody would know much about other nations and news would travel slower. Is that the kind of palce you want people to live in?"	6	6		12																					
21	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 daily, I am writing you to address the issue of computers in our society today. Each day new discoverys are made from the people that use computers in our society, however many people say that computers are harmful to are communtiy. Today I am going to convince you and society that computers are not as much as on issue as some people say they are. To begin with discoverys in our nation have been advancing rapidly. Each day new discoverys are benefiting our society however they are only being made possible by the help of computers. Without computers some for dieseases would have never been discovered and more people. Would have died. Secondly, computers have also increased medical care and have been the cave between life or death. Finnaly, computers help speed up production rates of cars household neccessitys, and many more objects. Have you ever been bored at home and looking for something to do on that dark, rainy, chilly night? Yes, exactly what I thought well the new technology advances in social-networking can even help the most bored and lonelyest people and give them something to do. Even if your just looking to talk to someone you can easily do that on the internet. So you people out there looking for that special someone will always be able to look somewhere. With all the social networks like twitter, myspace, facebook, and youtube you will always have something to do. During this economic recestion it seems that finding a job is so hard, however the internet comes to the rescue yet again. The internet can help you find a job twice if not three times as fast. Many people also speed up their word by using the computer. With microsoft things are lot easier to do work that you need to make up I hope that everyone can understand how much the computer help you, rather then hurt you. @CAPS1 of the newspaper, I hope you and the rest of the community can see that computer help you more that they hurt you. Thank you very much for your time and effort that you put in to listen to me."	4	4		8																					
22	1	Dear local Newspaper @CAPS1 a take all your computer and given to the people around the world for the can stay in their houses chating with their family and friend. Computers help people around the world to connect with other people computer help kids do their homework and look up staff that happen around the world.	2	1		3																					
25	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 off, I beileve that computers are very helpfull to many people by looking up information, or talking to friends. Although many kids should be spending their time outside, the computer is a well-occupied environment that helps kids learn and interact with others. I believe kids should have the right to stay on the computer as long as they desire. Although, they should always make time go outside, hang out with friends, ect. The computer @MONTH1 be fun but its always important to get outside and enjoy nature. Another reason why students should not spend all their time on the computer is because of their health. If a child gets addicted to the computer it will affect how he interacts with other and @MONTH1 do serious damage to their brain. Although, I believe children should have the right on the computer, it's always important to spend time outside enjoying nature. Another reason why I think children should have the right to the computer is because of the information they learn and discover. Many kids grow up to have a career in computer makings or program designing. Some kids @MONTH1 have their education online or to teach others. The computer is a non-stop generation of intelligence based to help people learn, play and discover. Many people have dream to one day build a computer or make new programs. All students should have the right to spend time on the computer but also to save time to spend outside and with friends. Everyone has their own perspective on how they think and if staying on the computer all day is a good thing. I do not think kids should do this because it might affect their health and how other think of them."	4	4		8																					
26	1	"Do you think that computers are useless? Or do you think they could be useful in many ways? I remember @CAPS4 my older sister had to do some research on @CAPS1, the computer gave her all of the information she needed. The issue to grapple with is, more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I strongly think that @CAPS2 does benifit society in many ways! Heres why, the computer allows you to get in touch with friends, research people, places or things, and relax and enjoy playing on a fun, entertaining website! My first reason is that @CAPS2 allows you to talk to family or friends so you all get back in touch if a friend of yours moved to a diffrent state, then you can easily get back in touch straight from the computer. ""@CAPS2's nice to send emails or pictures to friends, but if you do @CAPS2 from the computer then @CAPS2 gets done so much faster!"" @CAPS3 @PERSON1, one of my neighbors. My next reason is that you can research anything you want like people, places or things and all refferances will come up. @CAPS2 is good to research for any projects, or school assignments you @MONTH1 have. I remember @CAPS4 my brother was working on his project. Everything he had trouble with, he found directly on the computer! My final reason is that there are alot of fun and exciting websites that you can relax and play on! These websites can keep you busy, and you wont be bored while playing! ""@CAPS4 im bored I go on the computer and play games, that I find on @CAPS5.com,"" @CAPS3 my younger cousin, @PERSON2. Computers @MONTH1 make people become adicted to them. Yes but, you will be learning some interesting things on how the internet works. More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I strongly beleive that they do benefit society, heres why you can get in touch with people, you can research, and play fun games! @CAPS2's now or never to decide what you think! Call me and we will talk this through."	5	4		9																					
44	1	"People are spending too much time on computers. People that spend to much time on the computer do not have time to interact with family or friends. People spened to much time on the computer. The kids that spend time on the computer get bad grades. They also get tired every easy. First of all people spend to much time on the computer. @PERCENT1 of kids spend @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours on the computer. I once spent @NUM3 hours on my computer on @CAPS1. A lot of kids go on @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and iTunes. My friend spent @NUM4 hours on those websites. People spend way to long on the computer. Another reason, kids that spend time on the computer get bad grades. @PERCENT2 of kids that spend a lot of time on the computer forget to study for test. Once I spent all night on the computer and the next day I failed a test. Kids forget to do homework to. My friend was having so much fun on the computer he forget to do his homework. Kids should get off the computer and worry about school. My final reason, kids get tired from being on the computer for so long. @PERCENT3 of kids get so tired they can't do anything once they get off the computer. I got so tired from being on the computer for so long I took a nap. @PERCENT4 of kids forget they made plans after school. One kid was so tired he blow the plans off that he made with his friends. Kids need to get away from the computer. In conclusion, kids spend to much time on computers. People spend to much time on computer. Kid end up getting bad grade because they spend time on the computer. Aslo, kids get tired very quickly from being on the computer. Something has to be done about this."	4	4		8																					
45	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 you think the computers don't help you with research? Well, if you really think about it computers @CAPS1 help you. You can't always gain wait by just looking or staying on a computer. And you can defenetly still talk with kids, friends, and family members on computer. @CAPS1 you no if books have all the information you need for school project, or your own family history. Maybe books have our history of wars and of our heros. Try and see if you can find the first ancestor of your family. The computer are the reasons why we no our history and know about actors, slaves, sergents, and much more. Have you gain weight just from staying on the computer for too long. I haven't gain a pound or an ounce since I've been on computer. Not only can you gain weight or lose weight just by being on the computer. How @CAPS1 you know if the person on the computer is not looking for diet foods or fat free things? Or if the person is eating while being on the computer. @CAPS1 you get large phone bills just for a two minute long distance call? Why @CAPS1 you think we have enternet websites such as myspace, facebook, twitter, msn and lots more. Most of my family members life in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4, and @LOCATION2 and just for a call its like ten dollars for a minute. While you can be on the internet for about day to night and still pay the same price. So what @CAPS1 you choose pay over thirty dollars just for a long distance call or stay on the computer. Or get bad grades for doing the bad research. Its you chooce, choose now if either talk with family and friends on phone and pay over your bill money or stay on web chat for how long you want and still get the same bill price."	4	4		8																					
56	1	"Over the past decade, the percentage of people using computers has increased by approximately @PERCENT1. All of a sudden the world and its people have become dependent on information that computers provide. The variety of data bases and resources the increased communication and the skills computers allow you to portray and prove that they are essential for this generation. Communication over computers benefit now society can interact between one another. Personally I have been able to talk and see my family who live overseas through the advanced technology on computers. Different communication programs include @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and e-mail, the most commonly used cite. Without having access to a computer and its contents residents have a difficult time embarking themselves within the rest of society. For school events, sport schedules, and keeping in touch with far away family and friends. Computers allow all of these essentials to be part of society, and the way this generation has decided to start our lives. Paretns and teenagers these days have become very lazy in comparison to the way they used to behave. They are nit interested in going to the library in order to research information on people, places, and family heritage. Computers have been a huge convenience in a persons life by allowing all the information that was once in books to be contained throughout the internet. For example if you are doing a project for school. the internet will provide you with any information you need. It is truely astonishing how much one electronic instrument can impact and influence a life. Being a student, I am commonly curious about what references teachers are making and additional information that is not provided. The internet allows any person in possesion of a computer to research what they have wondered about and to give a response on the subject almost immediately the benefits of computers can practically cover the few negative effects as it is a way to let a person discover various information on any desired subject. Besides searching for information, computers can be used to document data of your own. Microsoft has invented several applications of which allow you to graph information design presentations, and neatly record drafts of writing. No person is flawless and is incapable of mistakes. Microsoft helps take your exentuated imperfections and hide them by doing things as little as making a neater copy of your essay, or putting your lists of data into graph form to make it more eye-friendly to viewers. Society has become reliant to sources scattered throughout the date bases on computers and by directly looking at the negative effects that a computer can have on aperson and therefore putting restrictions on this information source will enable society to have to positive donations that computers these days have on our way of life."	5	5		10																					
64	1	Dear news paper I think computers good for you because you can use the internet and myspace and videos and some school work like math and essays so yes I do think that computers are good for you because you can do all kind of things on computers. And computers can help you with school a lot and you can print out lots of things and why computers can help you is with your math writing spelling and most defyntly is science and ant also literature. The reason why I chose those @NUM1 things is because you can look those @NUM1 things up on. Computer and get the answer to math and spelling right like read @NUM3 helps you write and spell thats one at the reasons why I like computers because I can get on read @NUM3 and I love doing read @NUM3 a lot and I like the read @NUM3 class also because the computers sometimes I like reading on the computers but not all the time but I have to read that's how I'll first learn how to read by forsing my self forward to read. That's how I'll first learned how to read by computers and putting forse to my self. That's why computers is more important to me and look words up.	4	3		7																					
78	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion for using ""too much"" computer time is an outrage. I think people should have more ideas. Such as as exercise, socialize with family and friends, and lastly, ""you time"" which means to do whatever you would like to do indoors BUT @CAPS2 computers. For excersice you can do any sport that you like outside. For @CAPS3 and spending time with family and friends you can have a nice family reunion at their house @CAPS5 just ""hangout with your friends. Four ""you time you can draw, @CAPS5 read a book. Their is a lot of ideas instead of ""computer time @CAPS6 the time!"" With exercising can go outside and play sport such as basketball, soccer @CAPS5 baseball, etc. You could even play hide and seek with your friends @CAPS5 even tag. Anything that keeps you moving out of the house ins tead of using computers! If you exercise everyday such as ""workout"" to get fit you will definatelly manage that instead of using ""computer time"". Exercising is a good idea ins tead of using ""computer time!"" @CAPS3 with family and friends is a good use instead of ""computer time because you can finally have the time to spend time with then like talk to them, play games @CAPS5 eat dinner together. That's called ""@CAPS3"" Your family @CAPS5 friends will love to spend time together by eating dinner together and have a nice conversation. You could also play any board games such as ""monopoly"" too. With your friends you ran go to the movies, have a sleepover @CAPS5 play outside. Many good little ideas to do with family and friends instead of using ""computer time."" The last idea for ins tead of using ""computer time"" lis doing ""you time indoors. WARNING! But @CAPS2 computer time! You could do something quite like draw a nice picture. That's something nice and quite to do instead of using ""computer time."" @CAPS5 you could even read a book too. Maybe you have to catch up on your nightly reading for language arts and you want start reading your goal book. If you choose to do ""you time, you will definately manage to undo that useless ""computer time!"" @CAPS6 of these ""ideas"" for not using the computer is very easy. It's not healthey to sit around the computer @CAPS6 day! Instead you can exercise. You could also socialize with family and friends. Lastly, do ""you time. but don't use a computer!!! If you want to achieve a goal you can mange that!!!"	5	5		10																					
80	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I do not believe that computers are very beneficial to our society. Computers donot benefit us because they are stoping many people @CAPS3 exercising and healthy life, playing sports, and enjoying the outdoors. Computers are stoping many people, particular the younger generations, @CAPS3 exercising. Now a days instead of bitting the gym many people are home on the computer talking to friends or playing computer games. As a result many people are not as healthy as they should be. It's also recorded that any person who is on the computer for large amounts of times are hurting thier eyes, resulting in an increase of people wearing glasses. If people were to go and start doing things besides the computer they will live a happier, healthier, and better life. Unfortunatly, many young people are not getting in to play sports. During this decade many sports games have come out for the computer. Now instead of pushing themselves to work hard for aspact, kids ethier play with no heart or dont play at all. The reason for this is because they can instead work extremly hard on thier custom @CAPS4 or @ORGANIZATION1 teams in @PERSON2 or @NUM1. Also the computer is not the only electronic stoping kids @CAPS3 playing sports, xbox, playstation, xbox @NUM2, psp, @NUM3, gamecube and gameboy are some of the few console systems that play games that distract kids. I myself, had been caught thinking more about on xbox game then @CAPS2 own hackey game! not olny are these electronics pulling kids in like magnets but the parents are they are alarming thier kids to play video games or stay on the computer for hours on end. Many of us dont know what its truly like to go outside and camp. do not to spend time with thier family. I came @CAPS3 on @CAPS5 family and many @CAPS5 families are very close, so its natural to be doing things with @CAPS2 father or brother or whole or cousin. However not to many families are as close as so they do not do something togther. If some fathers took thier sons fishing or camping, it would get them away @CAPS3 computers and the father/son band will become stronger. These are @CAPS2 reason sir and they should be thought over far quite sometime. Just remember that many people need to exercise, many play sports, and many families got to exprience the outdoors."	4	4		8																					
87	1	"Computers. One of the much enjoyed pieces of technology. But it is also one of the many distractions. Many people ponder if computers are really beneficial. I am one of those thinkers. I think that computers don't always benefit society. They have many, many distractions such as facebook, online games, and even inappropriate images and videos. If you really think of it, are computers as beneficial as we think? My friend, @PERSON2 was just told about facebook, and got a membership. It just started out as a 'na big deal' kind of thing. She went online often, just to check on her status and if she had any messages in her inbox, and that's @CAPS2. But then, she was full-blown addicted. She applied for @CAPS2 the clubs and groups, and she started getting behind in school. She was obtaining a plethora of @CAPS1's on most of her tests after not studying because she was on for almost six hours everyday. @PERSON2 would come home and not even bother to do homework, but would just immediately go online. After one month of being a member, she was failing @CAPS2 of her classes, and her mom took her computer priveleges away. See, she was distracted by one, little thing, and her whole life was almost destroyed. ""But, mom, i'm in the middle of a game! And I'm winning!"" @PERSON1 says vistoriously. @PERSON1 loves online games, and he wins almost @PERCENT1 of the time. But, that's not the point. He plays games @CAPS2 the TIME. @PERSON1's game playing gets in the way with the interaction of him and his family. He @CAPS3't played eith his four year old sister, @PERSON3 since she was two years old. his mother also often eats dinner alone. Sometimes, he even views inappropriate pictures when his mom is out shopping. When he's playing a game, a girl @CAPS4 him, ""@CAPS5 at my pic. They're hot! and he looks at them. He thinks they're harmless but that's not what his mother thinks. his gaming has gotten in the way of his family and social life. most people think that computers are beneficial because you can find cool information. But, you can get @CAPS2 kinds of information from books. Instead of typing '@ORGANIZATION1', you could just @CAPS5 for it in a library. It takes less time, and you won't get carpal tunnel as easily. See? Computers aren't as beneficial as most think. There are @CAPS2 kinds of distraction, and these are only a few."	5	5		10																					
97	1	"Dear Local @CAPS1, I think computers benefit society greaty. Most of what we do today could not happen without computers. The biggest use of computers is comunication. If you're in @LOCATION1 on a buisnoss trip but need to send a letter to your company, you can send an emil which is much less expensive than paying for as piece of @CAPS1. The experts concerns that people aren't spending enough time with family and friends is a point. Many people cominucate with family and friends through computers. I would hardely yet to talk to my cousin if I couldn't go on facebook. I would have had to wait another month to find out my other cousin was engaged if I didn't follow her on @CAPS2. If the concern is face to face contact, the computer has a cure for that, too, a video messaging site called ooVoo. Another way computers allow comunication is through the shareing of information. Many facts needed for school are spread out in hundreds of books. Over the @CAPS3, I've done research for a project and have been able to get facts from the @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 about crime stats. Many times researching an animal will take you online because more modern books note good website to travel to for more information. Without the @CAPS3, a simple reasearch project could take for months. Some scientists think people are spending too much time on the computer. This both right and wrong. Sitting at a computer watching youtube for hours is not nessasarily the best thing. However, the @CAPS4 is also for computer. The @CAPS4 has designed a game so that you can have fun while getting excersize. Computers are like chocolate. They can be good, but too much is a bad thing."	4	4		8																					
101	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever gone somewhere, taken pictures, and posted them on the computer? If you have you will remember where you visited. But atleast you went to @ORGANIZATION1, or @LOCATION1 or somewhere. There are some people who are on the computer all day. Instead of experiencing nature and taken on @CAPS1 life brings to them, they are on facebook or youtube all day. This disgusts me because there are many fun, beautiful, and entertainings things to do. In @CAPS2 opinion I think computers have negative effects on people. People miss out on enjoying nature or interacting with friends and family. Some people do not get exercise anymore and it hurts to see obese people just sit ther and do nothing about there lives. First I'd like to talk about obesity. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of children are obese at young a young age? Computers take the place of exercising for a young boy or girl. They should go outside and play sports like basketball or soccer. Another thing is those game websites. Children get so caught up in a computer game, everything around them just disappears. All they worry about is winning the game. While playing this game they might eating doritos. Sooner or later five pounds is gained. Then they will regret not exercising and not be able to move. Later in life, when things are bad for them, they will realized on how many fantastic things they missed. Then they will say ""@CAPS1 did I do with @CAPS2 life?"" @CAPS2 next point shows that people are not enjoying nature. Have you ever taken a nice walk in the park? I know I have. Well people sit inside all day just taking a peek out the window, but don't think about going outside. Nature is beautiful, smells nice, even refreshing at times. But no. People sit on there butt all day. On the computer accomplishing absolutely nothing. Why can't they go outsite for a walk or a jog? People can see animals like squirrels climbing up a tree. How cute. But instead they play a virtual game where you shoot squirrels with a paint ball gun. So much is missed because of computers. As much as not enjoying nature upsets me, some people blow off their own family just to watch a re-run of family guy on youtube. @CAPS1 have we come to? Some children hit their parents because the parents shut the computer off. I'd rather enjoy a meal with @CAPS2 family and then just sit down, relax, and talk. Also some people don't get sleep becuse they are ""doing something important"" and miss a family trip or even school. In conclusion I believe that computers are bad because of obesity, missing nature, and not enjoying company of family & friends."	5	5		10																					
110	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers are good to society, because you can read the news paper online, email your friends and family, and can play games and watch videos or movies. Knowing the latest news is very important, news paper are okay but you have to pay for them with the news paper online you can get the latest news for free! This way you can save money and trees. Heres another way of saving trees. E-mailing is a good to talk so some one far away and it's a lot faster than just regular old mailing. E-mail is also good for e-mailing links to cool websites, on e-mail can send a funny picture or a video or an important notice. So, Computers can be your news paper and a good and fast way of communication. It also can be useful for entertainment. Computers are one of the most popular entertainment sources. Computers allow you to go on game sites, watch videos or movies or play on online game on just a regular @CAPS1 game. I know whenever I'm bore I go on my computer and I can always find something to don on line or find a movie to watch. So, computers are very popular, in many areas computers are helpful in news, communication, and entertainment. People just need to look at the positive aspects of computers, then they will see how great they are"	3	3		6																					
124	1	"I think that the computers are good to be used because anybody can use them at anytime or go on it whenever they want to. The reason why I think it is good is because you can contact someone that you know and talk to them whenever you want. Another reason is because you can play games or look for something or even make a research on stuff that you want to know or about something that you were always curious about. A computer is also usefull for better things like using it for when going to work or when a kid in school needs to do a report of project and needs to do it in typing and also to save stuff that you don't want nobody to use. Computers can sometimes be helpfull to people that really need it and that actually need to use it, but it can also be a fun activity to do if anybody doesnt have nothing to do. I think that the computer is awsome because anybody enough can open up their own website and create something what. A lot of people can go on the internet and open an account on a website; for example a @CAPS1 or a @CAPS2 or a @CAPS3 for that what to have an account. These are a lot of people that use the computer in a good way and use it for things that it can actually be used for. So I think that the computers are avery helpfull to people that like seaching for stuff that there curious about or to have to use it for good needs."	4	3		7																					
130	1	"Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society."	5	5		10																					
131	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are beginning to be a problem in many households. I feel that too many people are becoming addicted to computers. People like this are more likely to gain weight, have little social time, and spend too much time inside. In @CAPS6 article I have recently read in the @ORGANIZATION1, it was about @CAPS6 experiment on computer use. Dr. @PERSON1, a @CAPS3 professor stated that his findings showed that people who are addicted to computers only leave their homes to run errands. When this happens, it interferes with their lives as well as their bodies, because our bodies need sunlight. Furthermore, his study also showed that people who go outside more and not on the computer as much tend to be happier. @PERCENT1 of the study's patients started to be more joyful once they stopped going on the computer as often. I like when the people around me are happy, not grouchy, don't you? I have been noticing some kids in my school that are gaining weight. These are kids who have recently started going on the computer for a couple hours at a time everyday. This is very bad for your health and body. If someone sits at their computer all day eating the food is not being worked off, so it all turn to fat. Moreover, statistics show that @PERCENT2 of all obese people in a weight loss class had gained their extra weight from sitting at the computer all day. If people treat their bodies this way, they could end up with some type of condition. Last week, @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @NUM1 intervied @NUM2 year old @PERSON2. @PERSON2's best friend has been ignoring @PERSON2 because he got a @ORGANIZATION1 computer. Now, @PERSON2's friend doesn't want to hang out with @PERSON2, or any of his other friends. In addition, when people become addicted to computers, they become less social with friends and other people like parents, teachers, and more. When people push aside their social time for computer games, chat rooms, or movie websites, they lose a large portion of their life. This can be stopped if parents put their foot down, set limits, and make kids spend more time outside. As you can clearly see, computers @MONTH1 have some benefits, but they have many disadvantages. Addicted compuer users become less social, they don't go outside and start to ""pack on the pounds."" @CAPS6 effect of this is a world full of people who sit on the computer all day eating food and gaining weight."	5	5		10																					
139	1	"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers do have a positive affect on people but I don't think because of computers is the reason people don't exercise or enjoy nature. People make their own choices in life. The computer is just there. If somebody chooses to be on the computer instead of spending time with their family well thats their choice and problem not the computers. Me for example I love working and playing on the computer. Even though I'm on the computer I still do things like talk to my family, I play basketball, and I chill with my homies. Now thats my choice to do all of that. I can easily just sit up in my room and be on the computer all the time. It's nothing wrong with doing that because that is my choice in life. Nobody should be able to tell you to get off the computer because that is your choice in life. If you want to be on the computer instead of going outside thats your choice. Only you know what is best for you."	3	4		7																					
142	1	"As more and more people are becoming accustomed to using computers, I believe that this is having a negative effect on society. Because of computers people are not exercising as much as they should, which is of crucial importance. In addition, people are becoming unable to envoy and appreciate nature while they still can. Finally, people are slowly being their ability to communicate with family and friends. As every day people are getting in touch with technology they are losing touch with the world around them. Therefore, the advances in technology are having a negative affect on society. When the average, person uses, the computers, be it for business, homework, chatting, or just for fun, they are easily occupied for long periods of time. They consider themselves ""too busy"" for a thing called exercise which is becoming more and more curcial to our health and well-being. With music, walk, cool friends right in front of us, who has live. Time to go for a walk, jog, or bike ride? with computers, people are the will exercise. In this day and age, when is becoming a we need our exercise more. Every day rainforests indicated on the one, polluted, and clouded. We need and because of the realize ever a @ORGANIZATION1 screen. We need to write up and appreciate with the @ORGANIZATION1. As time goes by communication technology through the internet this issue of helping @CAPS1, healthy relationships is becoming a progressively worse issue. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" is something that doesn't completely exist on the internet. This means that while you @MONTH1 find someone you can call a ""friend"" online, you never know exactly who they are until you've actually, met them...which could be potentially dangerous. Additionally, the very @CAPS1 emotions and human need for interaction that comes with relationships is something their can never be simulated or programmed, no matter how ""advanced"" your technology is. As you can see, the dependancy on and average of computers is having a negative affect in our society. We are not taking the time for exercise, and human interacting, all of which are to our health. And in a world where it's more important than ever to do. healthy, grateful, and diplomatic, we are slowly losing important. Therefore, @ORGANIZATION1, are having a negative affect on society."	5	5		10																					
144	1	"Dear local Newspaper, In my opinion computers are a help to our plant. The new technology makes life easier to handle. The computer are a help because it teaches hand-eye coordination. You can talk to people, and it is a new way to be entertained. Computers can teache hand-eye coordination because of typing. Whether someone knows it or not when you are typing fast it is help you hands. Also the fact you that if your typing without making is also helping because it makes your hand easier to move. The typing is giving your hand lots of exersise because your hands are moving all over the place. The more you move them the more excersise you can get. Computers can really help hand-eye coordination alot. Computers can also help by talking to people. To talk to people far away is better to talk to on the computer because if you have a webcam you can see each other. You are able to talk to people from different countries. Also computers are able to be used in business meetings when a business has to talk with another from different locations. Like if part of the business is doing a project in hong kong, then the boss can set up a meeting to see how it is going. Another way to use computers to talk to people is to speak with a person you are not able to see in person. Like if a oerson is in the hospital but you're not able to go, then you can talk while seeing each other throw the computer. Computers are a great way to use in communication. Computer are also a new way to get entertained. They can entertain you because there is games that you can play. There are games that come with the computers and a lot of games on the internet. Other they being bored all the time you can play thousands of game with just a click on a mouse. Also to not be bored you can watch videos like youtube. You can listen te musicor watch comedy videos. Video also show a way do express what you feel and sat it in comedy, horror, or sad videos. Also for teenagers there is ways to talk to their friends like facebook. On the website you can talk with anyone on your friends list. In the end computer can help kids, adults, or teenagers. With just a clicking your mouse you can find a new powerful way of technology. And be able to got better hand-eye coordination talk to people and get entertained. So go get yourself a computer and amazed!"	4	5		9																					
145	1	"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1 are you adminitrating your loacl newapaper to society? You are probably using a computer to type the documents. If the government, businesses, schools, students and local newspaper are using computers for a variety of different tasks then @CAPS1 are thet not helpful? Primarily, computers are used for typing, editing and presenting as stated before, local newpaper are required to use computers to present their work. As a member of society, I knew I would not want to read something not typed anyway. The govermnet must announce laws to the people and use typed documents to communicate with different countries & states. Without computers signs, flyers, bussinesses, and even newspapers would not be possible. You are running late to work able to traffic on the hignway. @CAPS1 are you supposed to explain to your boss in time? You can simply email him the situation and arrive stress-free to work. Prctically the entire world uses computers as a source of communication, so why be indifferent? Computers make life easier for people through communication like email, social network websites such as facebook and aol, and even video chat. Computers supply an excellent source of communication that is even used throughout schools. Teachers and administrater interact with each other with important message using computers. if computers are important to them, the @CAPS1 could they be destructive to society? As a western middle school students, I know the amount of projects and research we are required to do per class. Without the internet this would almost be impossible. The internet allows research to happen. After reseach is finished, the paper or homework assignment must be typed and printed. Without the assitance from computers, ahving naetly-written and well-researched assignments would not be possible. To conclusion, I feel that computers are an excellent advance in technology and should be used as frequently as possiblr. Without them, newspaper could not print, teachers could not communiacte, and students couldn't complete tasks for school. As a student I know they help me with school and communicating with my friends and relatives. If computer are such a helpful source to society, why would people consider them as a concern?"	5	5		10																					
146	1	Dear local newspaper I think that usieng computers help people becuse if we did not have computers we would not now ehey thing about eneyone or eneything like all of the @CAPS1 I would not now eneything about them but with computers I know alot about them and there lives like @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 got shot in the back of the head and. @CAPS4 got shot to and I know alot about the @ORGANIZATION1 there white people that to fear in to black people and the same with the wars like world @NUM1 and world @NUM2 and the @CAPS5 and @PERSON1 and the @CAPS6 war there was like plain spy palin flying across @LOCATION1 and they shot him down becuse we were trying to see if thay had eney nuculer bombs offer there.

150	1	"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 computers does have some cons but they also have a lot of pros. Some pros are they show magnificant pictures of nature and it would pictures until you want to send them by email. You can even order tickets for planes, trains and movies. Let's not forget shopping and internet. If you go on the internet you can find many pictures of any thing you want. Such as pictures of nature, celebrities. About @PERCENT1 of all picture on the internet are true. A computer can also hold pictures that you take on a digital camera. It can even take a project on a flash drive and then download it. The computer can even email the pictures to any email that exsist. If you want to go to the movies or on vacation you can get the movie tickets online. You can get them at any ticket sales website. If you want to go on vacation you can get your hotel tickets even your plane train, or boat ticket online. Buying tickets isn't the only thing you can do on the internet you can buy stuff to. You can order @CAPS2, @CAPS2 @NUM1, @CAPS2 @NUM2, game cube, x-box, x-box @NUM3, wii, you even computer games. You can even buy the game systems. You can buy house hold appliances. Also you can put clothes and other store products an hold. The internet you can watch videos an almost any website you go on. Some @MONTH1 be grass, some @MONTH1 be funny others @MONTH1 even be wierd. @PERCENT2 of all teenagers like watching music videos. Some are just the artist sing and dancing in a background other times people make fun of other artists. Even though computers do have pros and cons they have more pros. Like the examples in the passage above."	4	4		8																					
151	1	"Dear local newspaper I don’t agree with the people who say people spend to much time on their computers. Because people can lean mostly anything they want all of a computer also there are lots of resomes why people should use advances technology they can teach kids how to find out answers to there homework the fastway instead of reading a book or taken a class and still get the full understeading. The people that say others spend's to much time on there computers are also right about that but they still can interact with friends and family they can play games, speak to each other, even learn new things together, all through a computer. One thing they were right about was to go out and enjoy the nature you cant do that on a computer but you can help the nature on a computer like try to put up a blog. Something that people make so others can see and spred the word and on that blog it can stay stop cuting down trees for stores or stop killing animales for there far or anythin you wont to write. So the people that do read this you should agree with me because you can do lots of things on a computer and learn lot more then you ever thought you could. So go out and find you a computer and find somethine you need to do or learn or just to have some fun."	4	4		8																					
153	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 are many people in this world that think always being on the computer is good because they can talk with people online and learn more about the world. But, then @CAPS1 are people who disagree with them. I am one of those people. Spending too much time on the computer can really affect your life. People stop exercising, don't enjoy the beauty of nature or life, and they aren't spending enough time with their family and friends. So, I hope that while you read through this letter, you take some of this information into consideration. First of all, when people spend a lot of time on the computer they aren't getting all of the exercise that their body needs. They become lazy and don't want to do anything. This is very bad because it will affect your health and the rest of your life. People @MONTH1 become overweight and since they got lazy from always being on the computer, they won't go out and get the exercise that their body needs. People need to enjoy their life! By always being on the computer, they won't be able to. @CAPS1 are so many fun and healthy things you can do for your body. You can go play sports and have fun while getting exercise. Many people do this and try to encourage their family and friends to do it with them. But, some of their family and friends are to lazy to do anything because they are always on the computer. Instead, they stay inside the house all cooped up and don't get enough fresh air. This is a horrible thing to do to yourself. Your body needs fresh air, so start enjoying your life a little more people! Finally, people @MONTH1 lose contact with family members of their friends because they are to busy on the computer playing games. I know I wouldn't want to lose a friend to the internet ever again and I don't think anyone else would want to either. I once lost a friend or two because I didn't talk to them as much as I used to because I had been too busy on the computer on @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and games. I felt horrible because I didn't realize that I had been doing that. I really wouldn't want anyone else to lose contact with a family member or lose a friend because of the internet. Its horrible and you don't feel like yourself anymore. Once again I would like to tell you that always being on the internet is not good. You can become lazy, not want to do anything etc., people aren't enjoying their life to the fullest and you can and @MONTH1 lose contact with a family member or lose a friend because you spend to much time on the computer. I hope that after reading this, you realize that being on the computer is not always good for you."	5	4		9																					
156	1	"Dear Local newspaper, I just read about your article regarding the computer usage. In my opinion I think that computers are a good thing. Yet, I believe that it could have a negative influence as well. I believe that computers are one of mankind's best technologies. You can type, learn about historical happenings, different places, and different cultures as well. You can talk to people from far away by using chat or the webcam. That's what I use to speak to my @CAPS1's who live in @LOCATION2. Computers are one of the best things that has happened to me and my life. However, although computer can be such a good thing, it can be bad as well. A lot of people over used it too. I infact know a person and she's a very nice person. She's sweet, caring, loves kids, and has a kind heart. The only thing is, is that she's a @CAPS2 addict. She loves @CAPS2. Sometime when she comes over, I'll be using my laptop and she'll ask to check her @CAPS2 status. My point is, is that she allows @CAPS2 to take over her. not cool. I read an article the other day about computer usage in @LOCATION1. Dr. @PERSON1 covered this article on the topic of computer usage. She said ""The average american spends four hours or more on the computer. Although there are other people who spend their time outside when it's nice. I congradulate them on that"". See, now you heard it from the expert as well. In cocnclusion, I would like to state that computers can have either a positive influence or a negative one as well. So it all depends on how you use it and how much time you spend on it. So my point that I would to come across @LOCATION1 is that use you computer wisely. Don't spend all of your time on it. Life's too short for that. So spend time with family and friends and go outside too!"	4	4		8																					
167	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 are beinging questioned if the are good for our society or not. I would have to say that they are good and bad you really can't pick a side. These good because children and teens can get the information they need to teach in school, it allows people to chat with others in different places, and it helps hand-eye cordanation. Those were the good here are some bad things about compters. People spend to much time on the computer instead of exercising, they dont' get to enjoy nature, and people stop interacting with friends and family. Anyone can pick a side. I just can't, because i can relate to both sides. For example. one of the good reasons about computers was that you can chat's with other people around the world. I can relate to that because when i live here in @CAPS2 @CAPS3 my mom and stepdad live in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 so i don't see them much but thanks to computer i can chat. With them when ever i want to. Honestly i wouldn't know how my life would be like if i didn't have a computer and i wasn't able I @CAPS4 now. Although, can also to one or the bad things about computers, which is that people spent to much time on the them. I can relate to that and so could of the other well, because when i around @NUM1 because go to a after school, go straight on my laptop and around @NUM2. When my grandma @NUM3 pm. She always comes in and ""Your on that thing to much you your hands!"" in her. So in my opinion I believe that coumpters can be good for our socity and bad; for me there is no side to take. Others might feel the same way, and others @MONTH1 not. It's up to them to make a choice, so ask your self,"" @CAPS4 you believe that computers are good or bad for our society?"	4	4		8																					
171	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects of computers is that some people are spending to much time on computers they are good to be on for a while but not all day. So @CAPS1 first reason why I think spending to much time on computers is not a good thing because it's better to be outside doing other activities with other people all day instead you could hang out with friends and do some sports or something else and if your on the computer all day you will start to lose some friends. @CAPS1 second reason why I dont think it is good to be on the computer all day is because if your not exercising you will start to gain weight cause your sitting all day just on the computer so its good to go outside and go for a walk or you could go to a gym so you could do exercise is good for you it will keep you healthy cause I know someone who is on the computer all day and he really does not go outside because he says that computers teach you alot and they do but it is not good to be on it all day. @CAPS1 last reason on some bad effects of computers is that some people could use these computers for bad things they could be going on some bad websites and that will just make you to be on the compute even longer you could even become addicted to being on computers because your doing nothing else ans some people have cameras on their computers and some people use them for same bad things so thats why it is better not to be on a computera ll day long. So these were @CAPS1 reasons or some bad effects computers could have on people if your not go outside to do some activities or to hang out with some friends."	4	4		8																					
172	1	Dear @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 I do agree that people should stop spending most of thier day on the computer and start to exercise more or spend time with friends and family. The computer has the ability to let you learn about faraway places but instead of sitting behind a desk and learning about somewhere faraway you should go outside and see it for yourself. Also our country is one of the top @NUM1 that has fat people and I believe that the computer has something to do with this because most of the kids in our school have a facebook and about @PERCENT1 of those kids are on facebook for at least an hour. This is why people should stop using the internet for most of their day because they are not getting the exercise they need that is why our country is one of the top @NUM1 in the world that has most fast people. The internet does allow you to chat with family and friends but you still need to hand out with your friends outside so you can exercise by playing sports or just going for a walk down the block if you don't you will not have a healthy relationship because someitmes they @MONTH1 not even be on the computer so you can chat with them online. Also if you don't go outside and enjoy nature and play with friends then you will become very lazy just by sitting in a chair all day and you would'nt care to do anything anymore.	4	4		8																					
175	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers are a sought after item in this day in age, and we are making advances in technology every single day. Social networking sites like @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 are all over the internet. Computers are good to some exstent, but some kids find the computer essential to their life. Using computers too much will have a bad effect on society. Oreos, @LOCATION1, @CAPS6 are all common sparks for people to be eating while on the computer. Now when you're sitting on the computer daily and for hours eating these sparks. You are begging to become overweight. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS7 kids are overweight and that is unhealthy. A collassal piece of this @PERCENT1 use the computer daily. There is no doubt obesity is a problem, and computers are making it worse. The people that love to use the computer definetly have some sort of social network account, @MONTH1 it be @CAPS5, or @CAPS4. Kids think they are immune to getting in trouble while posting messages or putting up picture of themselves. In one case a girl actually killed because of nasty messages posted about her. Three have been other cases in which girls have sent a nude pictures of themselves to their boyfriends and other people soul it. There lives will never be the same because they were using the computer too much. Soon we will become the leader of @LOCATION2 and we will get to the decisions around. If we are getting to know our outside world and we are not learning how to to be social without the internet, don't know how we will end up. will be the ones and all that important stuff. Instead of typing away we should explore the world and learn important things. Hopefully, as @CAPS10, we will become independent on computers and we will fit this problem by sending less time on a. Computers are great thing but they should not for going outside with friends and playing baseball."	4	4		8																					
177	1	"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I strongly believe that computers are a big benefit to society these days. There is so much to learn on a computer. And it is a lot more fun to learn of off a computer than a book. For intinst, let's say a student had to do a report, but he couldn't get his hands on any book at all. All the student would have to do is type in a few words on the internet and hundreds of websites pop about any topic he wants to learn. Another reason that a computer benefits society is ways to keep in contact with family and friends if they live to far away. Like me for instints, I live far from my friends. And the only I could talk to them outside of school was on a computer. We would be able to talk in a chat room or on a game. The same goes with Family. Lets, say your childre go on vacation and wants to keep in touch. All you would have to do is type as much as you want and click send and its at the other computer instintly. But, if you was to write a letter through the mail, it would take maybe a week or two to reach your child or the other way around. But, most of all, there are so many cool things you can do on a computer. There are a bunch of games, to play, or videos to watch. You can make music and make money off of it. My favorite would have to be the computer programs. Flash macromedia is the best though. You get to make your own animation clips or even a movie. Computers are really fun to play on. a computer has so many advanrages in today society. Which i'm very thank full for computers and all of the great stuff you do. That is why I believe computers benefit society."	4	4		8																					
183	1	"Dear local newspaper, I overheard some people talking about how much time their families spend on the computer. My opinion is that they should not be on the computer staring at a screen for long periods of time. I think this because it takes away time from important tasks, there is something healthier than enclosing yourself with a computer monitor, that would be going outside or being active. Another reason is that you can have more time being around family and friends. First, you shouldn't be spending so much time on the computer. You could be getting other tasks done. Such @CAPS2 working, or for most teens, doing homework. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 teens get easily distracted by social networking websites such @CAPS2 ""@CAPS1"". ""twitter"", and ""aol"". People in the workplace are distracted two. Sometimes the job can get boring, so workers just go on the computer instead of getting things done. Children could be doing chores or just helping around the house a little, but they go on the computer instead. Teens regular routine consists of waking up, getting ready, soing on the computer, school, coming home, snack, and then going back to the computer. We need to break those habits of going back to the computer. Staring at a computer screen for long periods of time is not healthy. Instead, you could be active in a sport, or just going outside and playing."" @CAPS2 technology goes up seizure rates have also gone up."" @CAPS3 to a doctor at @ORGANIZATION1. Being involved in a sport would be healthier and more fun that talking to people online. Also, your not exercising while on the computer, being active keeps your shape along with being fun. The most important reason you shouldn't be on the computer for a long time is because your using valuable time you could have used to spend with family and friends. Most people barely see their family when their at home because their consumed in the computer. Laptops have made it easier to block people out. Bringing it into your room and shutting the door, is the most common way. Hang out with the friends your already talking to online, wouldn't it be better in person? In conclusion, we should limit our computer time to do other tasks, be active, and spend time with friends and family."	4	4		8																					
184	1	"Dear people that read the news paper and that have @CAPS1 that like to play the computer all day more. Than a hour. I think you should take your time and read my article in this wonderful newspaper. I am writing this article about @CAPS1 using the computer more than an hour. My first reason about this computers issue is it makes than not pay attention in the school. To support that reason so you dont think i am making this up is that they play the computer alot and it makes the @CAPS1 just think about the computer and not think about school. They play it so much and it can mess up the @CAPS1 and they can not focus in school. My second main reason is it makes them allways want to talk about the computer. So if they play it mare than a hour like i said it can cause them to be addicted like drug's it is just like that if you dont want your @CAPS1 to be addicted to drugs i hope you woudnt want your own @CAPS1 to be addicted to the computer. To continue about your @CAPS1 can allways @CAPS2 about the computer it can make your @CAPS1 sound like they have no life because they play it all day everday and I would hope you woudnt want your @CAPS1 to be like this. Most importantly my final reason why you shoudnt let your child play the computer for more than a hour a day. Because they can get over weight. Your @CAPS1 well only get up and go to the bathroom, and eat, they will only do stuff that is in the house. Your @CAPS1 will not go out side and play and they wont get no exerse at all. I hope you will understand where I am coming from I have a brother that is offering in the hospital right computer too much and it messed and the doctor said he make it not so I am praying that he well make it out alive so I hope you woudnt let you @CAPS1 do this it will mess up their life forever.

Computers are used for many things like school work, planning that trip you always wanted to go to, and reading the latest news. Read the following to know just how important computers really are. You know now when you have that project due for science class about protoplasms. You want to do as you can so you have that at. When you realize that the one book you find on it wont help you with the score you want you realize that the nextplace to look is the computer. The computer gives you an unlimited amount of information that will help you in any report. When a teacher gives you a book to do a biography on, for example, ""The life and times: @PERSON1"" You want to go beyond what they give you and search, for instances, his neighborhood, his inspiration, and the influences he had. You will find all this in the computer. When you see a sale on a ""five nights and four days"" trip to @ORGANIZATION1, you want to know what better sale they have. When you start to notice that your family needs a vacation what is the only place to look. You can'@CAPS3 look for that trip of a lifetime in a book. Sure you can find out that @CAPS1 is having that big blowout sale, but you cant search up the best deal. I've done a research with seven of my friends and that six of those seven parents have deal on a trip to @ORGANIZATION1 on their accounts. If you're a great fan of road trips you'll find a deal or @CAPS2's for the lowest only find out by computer. If you live in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4 and you want to have a trip to the @LOCATION1 this deal is really good. If you live in the @LOCATION2 and you know the hottest day in the @DATE1 is coming you will be ready to get those beach balls and that blanket ready, but if you think computers are a waste of time then you wont know that all the beaches open and will be sending free drinks all day. You will be at home eating a @CAPS3.V. watching old reruns of The @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Not only will it tell you news in your erea, but will tell you about that devastating earthquake in @LOCATION5. You'll also be informed about what people are doing to help them and what you can do to help. So not only is the computer good for going on @CAPS6 and @CAPS7, you can help get your grade to an A+ on that history report. It also works well for giving your children a memory they will always remember. They also help you to get ready and not be stock in your house on that nice day in @DATE1. Maybe if you find that great deal or help your kid get a better grade then you will realize how good the computer is."	5	5		10																					
200	1	"Dear Readers of @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 has been borught to my attention that there is dilema on the effect of computers on people. Well I believe that having computers around are good because. Computers help students do there school work better. They also give the ability to learn about far away places. Lastly, computers allow people to talk to othe people online or webcam. My first reason I believe computers are good to have around is. They help students do there school work. Sometimes teachers give assignments out and you have to write an essay. @CAPS2 the student does @CAPS1 on a computer they might get a higher grade because @CAPS1 looks neater and more proffestional. Computers especially help out college students. A college university took poll one time. @PERCENT1 of student wouldn't know what to do @CAPS2 they didn't have there computer or laptop. One student even said ""@CAPS2 I didn't have my laptop I would probably fail most of my classes."" Computers can be very helpful when @CAPS1 comes to student school work. My second reason that I believe computers are good to have around is. They give the ability to learn about far away places or other coutries. I took a poll one time of how many people use a computer to find out whats going on in other countries, @PERCENT2 of them said they go on the computer to find out what's going on in another countries. Computers can be very handy when you want to know whats going on in other countries. My last reason why computers are good to have around is. Say you married and you are pregnant unless your guy of course, but your spouse is in @LOCATION2 and you couldn't them. Well computers these days have webcams. So now @CAPS2 you really need to talk to him or her you can by using webcam. So readers of the @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. Can you see now why I believe that having computers around is good. @CAPS1 helps students do there school work. @CAPS1 gives the ability to learn about far away places and countries. @CAPS1 also gives the change to talk to people with webcams."	4	4		8																					
207	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 a computer isn't harmful in any way. It helps people learn about things they didn't know. Also it lets people interact with people around the world. Another is that it lets people stay in touch with family and friends around the globe. Computers don't harm, they help. Computers are a learning tool. Schools like mine have over a hundred computers but they are only used for education. Anyway even if we try to go on different sites we get redirected to a blocked website. Cars and other machines were built by computers which supplied the blueprints. There is one thing computers are mostly used for, and thats to learn. Are you thinking about going on vacation somewhere but don't know how things work around there? Well a computer can help you with those promblems. It lets you see how people are and what the place looks like with a virtual tour. Even with some assistance if you don't know about traditions or beliefs. Computers are a great way to explore. Computers are a great way to communicate with others. Family members that live on the otherside of the world can use computers to talk and see how your doing. How about old friends that moved away. You can still talk and communicate with each other. Getting in touch with friends and family isn't all that bad is it? And these are reason to show how computers aren't harmful in anyway. It gives people a good education. It lets people learn about cultures of places around the world. And talking to friends is something thats good, not bad. This is why computers don't harm people, they help."	4	4		8																					
210	1	"Dear Newspaper, The question is whether or not people are spending too much time on the computer or not. In my opinion people aren’t, and there are many benefits from being on the computer. Typing in the computer teacher hand-eye coordination. It is easy to learn while on computer too, and you all communicate with people also! Handeye coordination is very important. We use it everyday during sports taking notes, even playing video games! Being on the computer is good because it develops hand-eye coordination. Whatever you do on the computer typing, playing online game, or surfing the web develop hand-eye coordination. It is good to learn hand-eye coordination because most teachers these days neat children to type and print their papers, so they are neater.If kids can learn hand-eye coordination, they can type faster turn then into their when go on there computer hand-eye coordination. My world cultures teacher lets us use an online textbook if we dont finished our homework in class, instead of logging around textbook. Any student would rather go online than have to bring a giant textbook to and from school. Have you ever thought about how much easier it is college course online. Then having to go to college especially for working parents? Everything happens online in you portable laptop, instead of having to go to and from a college. Using computer to learn about different places is easy. There are websites full of pictures of beautiful foreign places that hot deserts, and troppical rainfall of monkeys and tigers. It is fun and easy to learn on a computer. Since cell phones have become so a lot of people have gotten rid of thier home phone to save money. Sometimes, though cellphones lose signal. That is why it is good to have a computer. It is eat to talk to other people forums, chats websites and email. You can have intelligent,and its easy and free! It is east to communicate using a computer. Surely you've heard my reasons its okay for people to spend time on the computer you see my point. Yes people shall spend time outside or with family, in small does the computer good for you. It is easy to learn hand coordination and communicate on a computer."	4	5		9																					
211	1	"Not everyone thinks computers are good for you but they are a very good resorce to find information. It's not good to be on the compoler @NUM1 seven but to be on sometimes is not bad. A person who is on the computer all day and does nothing else except that, then that is not healthy at all. People just have to limit their time on how much they stay on the computer. Dont over due it! Computers are also very good for information as I said earlier. If you have a computer or a laptop and you need to find information on something the internet is there. For kids that need to do homework or a project and they need to look up some facts or information on something they could go on the computer for that. It is so much easier to do that then look for books that has all the facts you need. So computers have very good qulities and resources. They arnt bad or unhealthy unless if that is your life and that is the only thing you do. That is my opinion on computers."	3	3		6																					
220	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 being at home with nothing to do. You cant play basketball with @PERSON1 you friends because you have did hand eye cordenation. You want to learn about @LOCATION1, but there arnt any books. And you want to talk to your friends. That’s what would have happend if we dident have advances in technology. No handeye cordenation, we wouldent be able to learn about far way places and we coudent online. Ccomputers benifit our lives in so many ways. To begin with, hand eye cordenation is very important. Without @CAPS5 we woudent be able to ware or even hold a pensil. @PERCENT1 of peoples hand eye cordenation has emproved when using a computer. That was proven in a @DATE1 say a @CAPS2 by @PERSON2, head of human reactions. “@CAPS3 knows that your hands are the most oversized part of you body, the computer help down the movements to hone hand eye cordenation.” – @PERSON1 said that in a @DATE2 interview with sience magaziene. When you are clumsy you break things. Importan things sumtimes, like @PERSON3 in @LOCATION2 broke her mothers glass vase. @CAPS5 could have been helped if she had used a computer. In addition, computers give us the power to learn about faraway places. No books! @PERCENT2 of people prefer looking up information on a computer than in a book. @CAPS5’s a fact. Some people wouldent have heard about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 if @CAPS5 wasent for the websights that brodcasted updates on @CAPS5. Campers weudent have heard. In @ORGANIZATION2 had a front page spread to promote the use of computers instead of books. Books could be outdated but the computer will always have uptodate answers. Also, people need to be able to talk online. Bisness meetings, governments plans, to just chatting with a friend. People need to be able to stay in tuch. If the presedent couldent vidio conference he would be flying everyware. Emale is the only way @PERSON5 from @CAPS4 talks to her coworkers. “ I just am located so far away, its so much easier.” @CAPS5 makes bissnesses and major incoperations flow.”@CAPS6 is now the only way kids talk @CAPS5 seems.” @PERSON4 says. @CAPS5 lets them feel like there a part of somthing biger then they are. Now, @CAPS1 happy, healthy, and educated young and old amaricans. They can do and research whatever they want. Its amazing what technology does. @CAPS5 alows you to talk online research faraway places, and practice your handeye cordenation. That sounds like a good thing to me! So @ORGANIZATION1, computeristic fist are only good. So agree with me @ORGANIZATION1!"	5	5		10																					
223	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, I think the way how more and more people use computers are bad because, @NUM1 int's not good for people's health, @NUM2 people who use computers lots of times, refuse to spend time with family and friends and @NUM3 you can find more about something that's on a computer by going and studying it yourself. My first reason why computers have bad effects on people who use computers, is the health issue. Health in very important but sitting in front of a computer for hours makes matters worst. By the way you hunch your back in order to see something small on the computer creen, or when you hold on the mouse, waiting to click onm something for long period of time, can cause arthrities. My second reason why computers have bad effects on people who use them. Are that people who are on computers & end to sometimes refuse to spend time with family or friends like for example: @CAPS1 say a week ago you made a promise to have a family get together with the family, and they all count on you to come, @CAPS2 you get a computers, you go on all these neat websites that you never heard off it's amazing right! WRONG! before you know if, it's the day for the family get together and your line an hour @CAPS4 you amke excuse not to come. And that breaks you family's heat....My last reason why, to me computers are a bad idea is you can learn about another the computer by going on to a But its ore fun traveling or meeting people from that place @CAPS2 setting in a for and having your neck, back and sore @CAPS3 I right, I think I @CAPS3. Also idsfun to and ear foods from the culture that you fing cool off that lame computers.(To me that sounds like a good time to invite family and friends!) @CAPS4 therefore in conclusion, in my personal opinion computers have bad effects of people health, it can cause later bacj and neck problems maybe even activities. People who use computers a lot or love to spend time on computers refuse to spend time with family and friends, and @NUM3 You can find more about something like a culture or land, if you go and study its yourself instead of going on a computers for hours. I hope my opinion convinces others, hoe computers have bad effects on people who use it a lott, and take action into their own hands and do what is right."	4	4		8																					
230	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 would you want to do in your spare time? Would you go outside and maybe @CAPS3 the soccer ball around with your kids, or grab a bag of chips and log onto facebook or your email? The question is, do computers have a negative or positive effect on people. I believe that computers have a negative effect. Talking to friends on the computer doesn't let you learn social skills. Going on the computer can also be very addicting. Finally, it take's away from all the exercise you need. I @CAPS4 that after careful consideration you will agree with me that computers have a negative effect on people. Facebook, ichat and email are all fun and easy ways to talk to your friends and family online. However, are you really gaining any social skills by doing this? Talking to friends and family online doesn't help you have good social skills. When you first meet someone in person, you most likely want to @CAPS4 @CAPS2 to say and how to act. Typing on a keyboard doesn't really let you interact with people. @CAPS6 not invite someone over, or go out to lunch with your family istead? Computers also are very addicting. I can say for myself that once I log onto the computer, I might not be off for the next hours. This is the case for many other people too. Going on the computer is addicting. Il @CAPS4 that not everyone is using a computer on a daily basis the vast majority of people are. When I'm on facebook and I see the number of people online is one hundred or even two hundred, as time goes by, the number increases. The computer being addicting leads to getting enough exercise. Doctors say that adults and kids should get atleast an hour of exercise a day. Going on the computer takes away from this time. Instead of sitting on the computer for an hour, you could be getting your hour of exercise. instead A lot of times when someone @CAPS5 down at the computer, a snack goes with them. This just adds onto the fact @CAPS6 getting the exercise is important to stay healthy. I @CAPS4 that I would feel a lot better if I went for a run instead of going on the computer. You are probably saying that you have time to manage both, but some people would rather exercise. When these people see you on the computer, @CAPS2 kind of example does it set? If everyone limited their time on the computer we would all feel a lot better and be more social. I trust that you will agree with me that computers have a negative effect on people."	5	4		9

When you call you dont know if your them there phones bissy, or they a bad @CAPS2 takes long and you @CAPS2 better to stay and send on and know you didn't @CAPS2 helps in advertisment and sales. Sometimes maybe unrealible because anybody can change anything on the site. Not all things online are like that though.

244	1	"Dear @CITY1 current I am writing to you on the issue about people spending to much time on computers and not able to spend time with other people like family, friends and others. Also people are getting information off of the computer which is a good thing for important paper that you might have to do or collage essay to get in to that collage. Another reason is that people are truning a bit lazy and not getting to enjoy exerising and getting to get some freish air. To more on I will explain what I mean about being with family and friends. For example let's say that your friends are planing on going to yhis huge beach party that every one is going to. So you tell your friends to pick you up but beofre they come you go on the computer talk to some you know and your friends come to your house to pick you up but you are not  for them they pass on by you don't go go to school next day there talking about you miss the party. SO that is any story , it might seen long so, I'm shorting the next part which is the information on computer. Foe example lets say that you  doing on  paper you  . Just need youre more . You find a place you go on find good write come down yet of of the computer finish paper get grade that is good feel happy the end. So that is the only good end of the reason why computres are good. For some  reason some people went to stay inside on the computer but other go outside on a good warm day. So what is your reason myspace, facebook other its good if you talk to other people bad if all you worried about if your pics are good, what matters is there you need to be haapy. I think  done all I could. So thoses are my reason why computer are good and bad  for reasch bad because of nooding to exericis and need to be with friends "	4	3		7

My first reason is because computer's are not safe. My second reason is computer's could get you in a lot of troble. My @CAPS3 reason is you never know what could happen on the computer. Read on and see why I disagree. First @CAPS4 gonna tell you why I disagree. The reason why I disagree is because computer's are not safe because you could have someone trace where you live at then what? Second - computer's could get you into a lot of trobe such as posting things online or saying mean thing's to people. Next computer's are bad because if someone like's you and you say I dont like you they could post mean and hurt full thing's and then if you friend's see it you will probably get mad. Finally - in concusion thease are all my reason's why I think computer's are not good. You never know what coud happen on a computer there's website's there and some could start a virus on your computer. Also I think computer's are not good because computer's lead to no good so keep your child away from computers. Also be careful what chu @CAPS2."	3	3		6																					
254	1	"I walked into my living room. I saw my brother on the computer talking to his friends on facebook. I thought to my self he's always on the computer never for any school reason. People always says we don't need computers I personaly agree with the statement. In the town @ORGANIZATION1 everybody mostly has computers. Without a computer to look up for content things, you have to go to the library and check out a bank. Just the other @DATE1 my friend @PERSON1 went to the library and checked out a book about the @CAPS1 culter. He loved that book he read it @DATE1 in and @DATE1 out, he read it for a book report on different culters. When he handed it into the teacher the @DATE1, when he reached the classroom the teacher looked @CAPS2 happy when she gave him back his test he had an @NUM1. He didn't use the internet your computers not mobile like a book if you wanted to learn about something while your traveling in you car you can't plug your computer in and use it unlike a book. Also books are usually funnier to read. Not haveing a computer can conclude to a lot more things like exercising. While my brother is inside all @DATE1 me and my friends are outside playing football, basketball, baseball, soccer, kirkball, and dogeball. We are very thin because @CAPS3 what we do almost every @DATE1. Unlike my brother were he is obeast because @CAPS3 all he done were before he had the computer he was as thin as us. It is also unhealth to be on the computer all @DATE1 because that can lead to staying update at night, don lead to missing the bus, and also lead to bad grades.

We also make the right choses in food to eat to have more energy such as fruit and vegitibales. Were my brother eats all the junk food which helped lead to obesity. Not having a computer can help you spend more time with your family. When we go out to eat my brother is always in a push to get back on to the computer dosen't let us enjoy our food. He usually is @CAPS2 much in a rush he picks off of other people's @CAPS2 they would be finished faster, when every one wants to enjoy then food. When we want to go out to the movies my brother stays home on the computer. Even if we buy a movie and whatch it at home he won't whatch it with us he's on the computer. It really makes my mom, dad, brothers, and sisters mad that he won't do any thing but play on the computer. Even when are whole family gose out side to play a sport he won't come out and play. It's like he's not part of the familiy anymore. Its like he forgot we were even @CAPS3 the reason why I think computes should be in the state of @LOCATION1.

264	1	"Dear editor, @CAPS1 do you do all day? The answer to that would probably be sit down in front @ORGANIZATION1 a computer all day. My friends say that this is very unhealthy, research as proven it and my mom has had experience with the computers. This just isn't healthy for our envierment and people. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 my friends say that computers are a waste @ORGANIZATION1 time. Most people who interact on the computer all day don't have a stable diet or even a good excersice ruinte.

Computers make this a reality for us, but that isn't the only benefit they offer. Computers help society by providing us with search engines and educational resources allowing us to connect easily with friends and family, helping us communicate importances and plan things and a lot more. First, computers have become a vital part of education and research a like. Students at schools, elementary through college, are able to connect with much more information than without computers. You can even earn a college degree on the computer! That's right online universities are beginning to form. This is great for moms who want to get a degree but have to stay home with their children. Also, computer technology has been applied to research in science and hospitals. New discoveries have advanced with the help of computers that will actually help people's lives! Computers are used to search for a cure to cancer disasters such as earthquakes, and even help see a disease someone has before its symptoms even begin to occur! Computers have helped save lives and benefit lives in ways people never could have imagined sixty years ago. Secondly, computers allow people to connect and reconnect with other people around the @CAPS2. I recently got a facebook account, and within a few days I had found and to three friends of mine that had moved away a distant cousin who had moved to @LOCATION1 that i haven't seen since we was little and even my great grandmother!

Lastly, computers help the @CAPS2 communicate with one another. the internet is filled with websites made to benefit our @CAPS2, one being @ORGANIZATION2; @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.

When i am bored i sometimes go on, and so for i have filled over thirty bowls of @ORGANIZATION1, while learning at the same time! To conlude, computers have proven to benefit the @CAPS2 and all in @CAPS5, not only people but the environment, too.

270	1	"Dear @CAPS1 sun, I find that computers are very useful. They help people in many ways. They let people learn about what is going on in the world, teach hand eye cordination, and let you meet people online. First, people can learn about what is going on around the world. I can find out what is happening where I live by looking up your newspaper. Other people can find out about places they might go. They can find out what the weather is like so they know how to puck when going places. Also, if one of your employees is going camping they can look up a good place to camp and they can look up what kind of dangers there is when you camp so they can avoid them, because if they get sick they can't work. As you can see computers are important. Next, computers teach hand eye ncordination. Many jobs need you to be able to work well with your hands. Lets say one of your printers break down so you call someone to come fix it. They must be able to work well with their hands to fix it. Now lets say the wiring in your lights get messed up. So you call an electrician has to be good with his hands to be able to work with small wires. Both of these people are good with their hands and they could of become that way by using computers. As you can see, computers are important in today's life. Lastly, computers let you meet new people online. Lets say you are all alone after a hard day of making newpapers. You could go online and meet new people in chat rooms and online games. Now lets say that one of your employess just broke up with his girlfriend and he is sad and lonely, so she isn't working as well. He could go on an online dating site and meet the perfect girl. Now when he comes to work he is happier and making more papers and if he makes more papers you make more money. As you can see computers are very important. In conclusion, computers are wonderful machines. They can let people learn about what is going on in the world, teach people good hand eye cordination and let people neet new people online."	4	4		8

Computers teach hand-eye coordination and allow people to learn information from all over the world. Lastly, computers allow people to communicate through internet. Advances in technology improve society and the over all way of life around the globe. Advances in technology are amazing. Computers show these advances greatly. With the simple use of a computer, one can learn great hand-eye coordination skills. Typing skills are a great example. Typing skills are needed by almost everyone in the world. Without computers, no one would have these skills. A young child can go on the computer, play a game, and learn basic typing and hand-eye coordination skills to jump start their coordination skills for the rest of their life. Advances in technology are great. These advances in computers can also allow people to learn worldwide information. Many times in school, students are asked to do a report on a different country. It would be very hard to do that report without a computer. The student would need to go through all different books to find specific information needed. With the internet, that project can get done a lot faster just by typing whatever you need to know. How about that family vacation you've always wanted to go on? Need an idea of where to go? Use the internet! All you need to do is type in vacation spots and click enter. Instantly, you will have hundreds of choices right in front of you. This makes life a lot simpler. Do you remember the last time your mom or dad went on a business trip and you couldn't talk to the because they were busy? there is a fix to this with internet. You can communicate with them through @CAPS1, @CAPS2 or both. Just hookup your @CAPS2 to the computer and instantly say good @TIME1, or hows it going.

In conclusion, computers and advances in technology are great and can benefit everyone in the world computers tech hand-eye coordination, allow one to learn information from around the world, and allow communication through internet happen instantly. Writers and editors of the newspaper, please agree with me on this topic. Advances in technology can only add posotive effects to the way of life.

They even allow people to talk online. Computers are a very usefull piece of machinery. Computers teach hand-eye coordination. When your in school, you need to type lots of @CAPS1 prompts, @CAPS2 labs, and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 vocab. Computers help us do that. Typing fast and correctly takes practice. Typing without looking at the keyboard is hand-eye coordination. This will help us later on in life also. Whether it's typing term papers in high school or your application essay for college, you will need the help of computers. Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places. @NUM1 years ago I look a trip to @LOCATION3 for the first time. I didn't know a lot about the history of @LOCATION3 so I sat down at my desk and turned on my computer. Suddenly, it was like I was in @LOCATION3! I read about the delicious food and rich culture. I took a virtual tour of the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and the great @CAPS7. I heard @CAPS8 music and learned some @CAPS8. In just @NUM2 hour I visited @LOCATION3 right from my very own house! Computers can take you on a magical journey to a far away country. Computers allow people to talk to online with other people. This is a very good thing. I have cousins who live in @LOCATION2 and because of the @NUM3 hour time difference, its not always easy to talk on the phone so we use the computer. My family will send e-mails back and forth with them. Sometimes we will even video chat! @CAPS3 networking sights accesible by computer such as @CAPS10 or @CAPS11 allow us to talk to people who we don't regularly see. On @CAPS11 you can even talk to your favorite stars or musicians. Computers let us keep in touch with others. Computers have a positive effect on people. Some experts @MONTH1 say that people spend too much time on the computer and while that @MONTH1 be true to some people, its not true to everyone. We still exersise, and spend time outside. We still interact with family and friends but know we are also able to do so on the computer. More and more people using computer is a good thing."	5	5		10																					
291	1	"Have you ever thought about all the amazing things that computers have done for us? Now, we can learn about anything we want, talk with people on the other side of the world, and even advance in other areas of technology. Computers have, without a doubt, had a positive effect on people. Just imagine this...one second you can be in the blazing deserts of @LOCATION3, the next in a losh, steamy, jungle thriving with animals...All without leaving your room! Using computers, people can learn about new places and things whenever they want. The millions of resources on the internet make it possible to learn about t other places and times. Although this information @MONTH1 be in a local library. Going on the computer is MUCH easier. Who want to go through the trouble of loaning books from the library, when the internet is there for your use any time? No registration to get a library card. No late fees and no waiting lists. It is quite clear that using your computer to do research is a very valuable thing. @NUM1 out of ten people said that they would rather email a person than talk on the phone with them. Now, with computers, people can instant message, or email anyone, anywhere in the world. Making a call from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 can be very expensive but with email, I can talk to my @CAPS1 friend, @PERSON1, free of charge. I remember when she moved to @LOCATION2. It was sad, but we promised to stay in touch. With e-mail and instant messaging, it was easy to talk, and exchange the latest news! Having the ability to communicate with soemone easily is an unbeliveable privalige, that would be none existant without computers to help us. Lastly, computers have helped people make advances in othe areas of technology. Where would we be in science and medicine without computers? These machines have helped scientists to do experiments. With a simulated expiriment they can be positive that no other variables will affect your results. Now, experiments can be extremely acurate. Computers have helped advance medicine as well. They have been the key to unlocking all sorts of cures for dangerous diseases. Who knows, maybe in @NUM2 years therew ill be a cure for cancer. All of these amazing accomplishments have been positivly effected by computers. ALthough some people @MONTH1 think that computers have a negative impact on our day-to-day life, I @PERCENT1 disagree. People have learning, talking, and advances in technology with one click of a mouse. Computers have effected people positivley in many ways, so, click away! Computers have none of that."	5	6		11																					
315	1	"Newspaper and Readers, Computers are a very large part of our lives and society. However, there are still people who think that computers do harm. Actually there are many positive effects that computers have on people. Among those effects are ease of communication, ease of gathering information, and ease of find entertainment. Computers have far more positive than negative effects. Computers have made communication easy for people. There are so many different means of communication using the computer, which are all free. For example, instant messaging, @CAPS1-mail video chat, chat rooms, @CAPS2 (and other social networking sites), are all there and help you communicate with friends and family. The positive effect that this has on people is that it allows them to stay in touch with people whom they might not otherwise due to financial or convienency issues. Being social is heathy for people and therefore communication is a positive effect of computers. Information is far easier to aquire when a computer is used. For example, if a kid needed to know about the climate of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4.S for his social studies project, instead of having to get in his moms, drive all the way to the town library, spent time looking for the book, he could just log on to @ORGANIZATION1 and go from there. This is a positive effect on him because it saves him some time and effort. Furthermore much more useful information can be found on the internet as well, such as: flight times, prices, restaraunts, stocks, weather, news, and basically any fact that you need to know. All at these things make having a computer a very positive thing in somebodys life. Computers are a great source of entertainment. In this economy, I know we all could benefit from not having to pay rental fees for movies and big prices for your exams or playstation games. Internet gaming is very amusing and you can find many good games for free. In addition to that, there are websites who offer free movies and television shows to be streamed right to your computer. These things are a great solution to the rising lost of entertainment. Saving money and enjoying good entertainment are both positive effects on people, and both offered by computers. I hope now that readers of this newspaper will now understand how good computers are next time you are for king for a late fee on a libary book or movie, remember that the internet and your computer have offered an alternative."	5	5		10																					
318	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2’t you think computers help society? I do I strongly belive computers help society and are being used for very good purposes. They help people of all ages. Its easyer for kids to look up information for @CAPS3, gives kids some good facts to help build knowlege and not only would it help kids but it will help adults too. Its easy to see why adults think kids dont read enough however kids get more than enough reading done on the computer. some parent think that just because kids arent going to the library to take a book out for their report they arent gaining knowlege but they are gaining knowlege because all of the things they could look up in a library they have availible to them on the computer. Computers help kids around the world find thing quickly and easily. Not only does the computer give them knowlege of things that happen in the past but also things happening in current times. It can also give kid information like weather updates that help to keep then safe. Over @PERCENT1 of the things you can find at the library you can finf on the computer. Some parents think that kids arent getting enough exencise but never the less they are also skiping out on a lot of knowlege and important facts also. On the computer you pick up a lot of facts such as wether updates natural desasters how to help others in need and other very important facts. If it was't for computers kids would not make up for all the knowlege they miss in school. on make up for what they miss when they are dosent. Computers help people everywhere gain knowlege. Not only have computers helped kid but they also help adults. They can do work over the computer look at houses, cars and lots of other important things. Certenly @CAPS1 you would not want to take away all of things knowlege and help being given to hot kids and adult on the computer. It helps aldults especialy keep thing going in there baissy lives. It also helps than make changes such as how they eat or act @CAPS4 are some reasons penale should not disaprove of computers because they help kids with @CAPS3, give kid important facts and, help people of all ages. sarely some of @CAPS4 facts could helpchange,"	4	4		8

So, they contain many inspirational articles which can convince kids to strive for surless. Lastly, when all else fails, the computer can be a great way to relax and clear your mind. Computers help organize your thoughts, which helps reduce stress. Imagine you working on a project in school. Everybody can add to it, and you can selectively choose which additions you want. In addition, you @MONTH1 also block the programs that you don't want. This device is called the computer, and it's changed @LOCATION1's society for the better. On average, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS1 suffer from stress. Now if you organize your thoughts on the computer, and are able to look through them again at why a huge alleviated. Instead of worrying thoughts you @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not remember, you now have confidence that you can look back and find your thoughts right on your @CAPS2. Reduced stress trading to confidence effect on society. Also, the computer contains articles that @MONTH1 insure our children to strive for their goals.

By games, I observe how into @CAPS3 since I started seeing @PERSON1 as role model to me, high making a stride for a @CAPS4.O @CAPS5. Where did this inspiration come from? Researching @PERSON1 on the internet. The internet, in this instance, obviously had a positive impact on @CAPS6 society. Lastly, when all else fails, you can rely on the computer to make stressful situations seem less overwhelming. If you have the ability to solve a problem, then why can't you solve it? Often times, the answer to this question is that the situation is too overwhelming. If you take a break go on you @MONTH1 relax simple games put out a variety of websites. Now say you came back and attack the problem again. You continually chip away at it, and it seems overwhelming. Thank you computer gods!

321	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I will be talking about the wonderful impact computer technology has had on man kind. So many great discoveries and great topics have been found on the compture, studees have shown <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of famous in the united states has at least one computer in there house holds. There a great way look up important information withoout going to the and searching for hours, to contract others, and lets face it they make our a life a whole lot easier. Imagine this! your stressed and on edge you have just @NUM2 hours searching for a topic on your upcoming history essay. You have a pounding head ache and just want to quit, your probably in the libary reading through hundreds of books. Now imagine you being at home sprawled across your lap, all it takes is a few taps on your keyboard and bam! Instant information. Now how easy was that, thats one of the great impacts computer have made on us, humanity. Computers are terrific to learn things with a fast pase to it. I personally have used computers to @CAPS2 advantage you logon go to google type the subject of knowledge and its just like you have a personal teacher in your own home. A local study has been underway the have a groups, @CAPS6 A which has a libary full of books and @CAPS6 @CAPS3 a @CAPS6 with a @CAPS4 @CAPS5, The scientist gave them all the same essays, @CAPS6 @CAPS3 <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of student have passed with flying colars while @CAPS6 A <@PERCENT1@NUM4> passed with a @CAPS9 or higher. Thats important because higher grades, means higher test scores. higher test scores equal fundimg. I think computers are the best invention and is not imparing humans its evolving them. Imagine this! your sitting at home crying because your special other has moved far away from you well computers are a great way to reconect with that person. Computers have software were you can instant message, send emails, or even video chat with that person. For even some business man its an way to have meetings without flying @NUM5 miles. I have @NUM2 aunts that I cannot live without who are @CAPS2 strong base who I cant live without talking to for a day. Without computers I dont know what I would do. Scientist tool surveys that @PERCENT1 to the @CAPS10.S.A has family in other states, countries, or even contents, hey have to have some way to be in contact. @CAPS2 last reason is I know we have to admit it computers have made me and your life easier. Some jobs that have opened up giving unwadged citizens a sorce of income on computers. <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of jobs relay on computers. Imagine a chasier counting all the money, a banker having to take time counting one by one other peoples cash, a telemarketer calling with no way of information. All these ways and more that computers have impacted us. Now lets see how has computers not needed our learning ability, contracting others, and last but NOT least made me and yours life better. Computers are a terrific way for human to adap to the fast life."	6	6		12																					
326	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are one of the most useful things that we can have. First, computers are good for communicating. Students @MONTH1 contact teachers through email if they have a question about an assignment. Computers also are useful for teaching. People use the @CAPS2 everyday to get information on their favorite sports teams or on a new recipe they saw on television. Finally, computers help us get work done easier. Student and employees use @ORGANIZATION1 for everything from writing a paper to creating a presentation. Futhermore, computers are extremely essential to our everyday life because they help us communicate, learn and finish work. Every year, thousands of students go to college, and thousands of families move away from each other. Computers are one way of communicating to @CAPS8 loved ones in far away places. Parents send messages via email to their children at college. Families speak with each other through @CAPS3. Computers are what makes all this possible. Not only can we use computers to make contact with our families,but we can also use them to speak with our teachers. Whenever a student is sick, but wants to get their homework finished, they look on their teacher's website. Here, all the homework for the class is listed. Also, if a student has a paper due the @DATE1, but their printer is broken, they @MONTH1 email the paper to the teacher. This allows the student to get full credit for their work. Email is not onlyuseful for handing in projects, but also for asking questions about the assignments. If a student has a question about an assignment, he or she can ask a friend or the teacher. Then, the student will be able to successfully complete the project. Computers are one of the most useful ways of making contact today, but communication is not the computer's only purpose. The average person goes on the @CAPS2 ten times a @DATE1 just to get information. Computers provide a pletvera of knowledge for people's use. Search engines like @ORGANIZATION3 or yahoo provide answers in less than one second. This is much faster than going in the library and spending an hour looking it up. Website text is not the anything that provides information far eager learners @CAPS5 also provide pictures to further the persons understanding about a topic. For example, if a person is living in the @LOCATION1, and has lived there all their life, but is reading an article on a website about an animal native to @LOCATION2, they would not know how to picture it in their head. Articles and books @MONTH1 provide a description, nut nothing really gives the person a solid picture. The person could go online and search for a picture, which they will surely find. Finally, computers keep the brain active. While searching on a website, a person could piece together information from different sites to create a better picture, and, therefore, have a more complete and thorough understanding. In order to do this, however, a person's brain must constantly working. This helps develop skills later on such as problem solving. Overall, computers are one of the most useful and common of the learning devices. Many people say that computers are useful. They agree this by saying that work gets done so much easier and faster on a computer. on average, computers complete work fifty times more efficiently than people do by hand. This is because of programs such as @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS8 programs allow people to cerrect spelling and grammatical mistakes while at the same time creating a neat looking presentation. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people with bad spelling or grammatical habits corrected @CAPS8 mistakes quickly through @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS6. If people constantly make grammatical or spelling errors, then having them underlined in @CAPS6 will show them that this is not the correct way to punctuate or spell something in a sentence."	4	6		10																					
329	1	"Dear town @CAPS1 paper, I would have to pick being for computers. There are a couple reasons why I'm for computers and they are being able to talk to friends online, being able to learn stuff, and you can also play video games. One reason that I would be for computers is so you can talk to freinds online. So if you have a facebook or myspace you can talk to your friends all day if you wanted to. What I mean is simply by typing in what you want to say to your friend they will receive those exacte words then they'll reply. For example if you wanted to just say hi then your friend would look at his/hers messages then just reply. So being able to talk to friends online is one example why I for computers. Another reason that I would be all for computers is being able to learn things. So if you wanted to learn a language then you would go to google or something and try to find a fast easy site. What I mean is if you goto google a whole bunch of site's will come up, so what you want to do is find the fastest easyest site for you. So being abe to learn important things like a language is another reason I'm for computers. The last reason for me picking computers is because you can play video games. What I mean is if you were borde and noone to talk to then you can get on your computer and play a mind numbing game or an educational game for class. For example in science class we played a game on the computer and it had to do with gravity and that was what we were learning about so it was an educatinola game. So that is the last reason why I'm for computers. I'm for computer because you can play games. So now you know why I'm all for computers. I am for computers because you can talk to friends online, learn stuff and play video games."	4	4		8																					
340	1	"Computers, More and more people are using them. They are used to talk, for lesieure and many other things. But are computers a good thing? Computers can be a very good thing to have around. Besides practically unlimited information, you can stay in touch with your family using @ORGANIZATION1. You can use @ORGANIZATION2 word to make documents and powerpoint presentations that organize your ideas. Also you can use @ORGANIZATION2 excel to manage your finances! Windows movie maker allow you to contruct your own movies ifl you own a camera. Besides the obvious most helpful features, you can play computer games, watch mores and listen to music on a computer. Like anything, computers have downsides too. Some are small and some can be very big. computers are expensive. You can't see who's really talking to you on a computer. Also, many people have important information on a computer. Peoples computers have been infected and information has been stolen leaving people helpless. Bugs can also seriously damage your computer rendering it imposible to use. Many people can be smeared on the internet as well. Hate sites that encourage terrorism, racial violence and drug use are all over the web. You have to be careful where you go when using the internet. Also, sometimes computers can take over peoples lives. People spend too much time on facebook and not enough time reading or keepng in touch with family. Computers can be great things. Between their great features allowing you to be informed all the time and programs that or be great for managing buisness, it's no wonder almost every @CAPS1 household has one. Many people don't like computers. They say that the cons outweigh the pros. I disagree. Yes, the cons can be annoying & sometimes serious. But if your smart enough to stay away from @CAPS2-@CAPS3, install anti-virus software, and never give away your information to an unamed surce, the pros outweigh the cons. So overall, if your smart enough, a computer can be a fun, convienent edition to your life allowing you to do more than you ever imagined."	4	5		9

Exercising, great way to stay in shape but is you sit on the @ORGANIZATION1 all day you don’t have a chance to stay in shape. So while everyone is fit you eventually will be fat. Whik you sit there playing the some @ORGANIZATION1 game everyon is out side playing at the park, swimming in the pool or fishing at the lake. Sitling on a @ORGANIZATION1 destroys your life bot physically and socially. Lastly, @ORGANIZATION1 will stop you from spending time with friends and family.

Lastly, I you sit on the @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1 you will miss out on the awesome @CAPS2 life you were waiting for since you can remember.

With facebook you can take a picture of yourself and place it on your web page. It is relly quite easy. Also, with @ORGANIZATION1 you can chat with your best friends and can actually see what they are doing. But if you want to do this you are going to need a webcam. I have @ORGANIZATION1 and I think that it is a wonderful resource. I have relatives in @LOCATION1 that I only get to see once a year. But with the help of my computer I can interact with them all year round. Computers can make people from faraway places learn about the culture and ways of another person's lifestyle. Have you ever seen the commercial where a little boy is talking to his father on the computer. Well, in this commercial is laying down on and is eating an @CAPS1 cookie. While he is doing this he is talking on the computer with his dad who is doing the same. At the same time both father and son dip their cokie into a glass of milk, eat it and laugh. I felt at that time that it was a wonderful moment because even though they are both in opposite directions the two are still having a great time. Just to think that it was all because of one computer. Exploring the internet is what a computer can do. When doing this you can play some really fun games on a rainy day when you are bored. You can look up what happened during one of your favorite basketball games. Such as how many points @PERSON1 got for your fantasy team. Also, at my school you can check your grades to see what you got on your last math test or quiz.

387	1	"Dear, editor @CAPS1 you know, @PERCENT1 of children who spend most of their time on the computer that do not exercize can develop weight problems and blood disorders? That is just one way that advances in computer technology have affected people so far. If advances continue that number will increase and other problems @MONTH1 arise from it. Some other problems that we have @DATE1 that could get worse are, developing a weak immune system, and emotionally seperating yourself from your family. First, lets talk about obesity. Obesity is a terrible sight to see someone go through because of something as silly as being, basically, addicted to the computer. Not only can obesity constrict vital organs but it can lead to blood disorders. Blood disorders, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, can cause you to have a heart attack. Which cuts off oxygen to vital areas of the body. Which leads to, eventually, promote death. Dealing with obesity is bad enough, but seeing them suffer because they have developed a weak immune system is horrable. In my experience I find that people who are on the computer often generally don't have very good immune systems. For example, a friend of mine is on the computer quite often, and has developed a weak immune system. Because of it he misses at least @NUM1 day of school a week. And because he misses so many days a school year he usually keep bad grades. Which is yet another reason why advances in computer technology are a bad idea. So isn't it relatively obvious that advances in technology are a bad idea? Especially being that, children are steadily becoming obese, and developing a weak immune system can affect your life in ways that are totally controllable? So I urge you to write an article about this to stop the growing sickness known as health problems due to technology."	4	4		8

When your on the computer your not talking to people and becoming social and you could loose connections with you friend and your family. When you loose your connections and become you will use your computer more and then @CAPS1 will become worse. My last reason is that @CAPS1 effects education because when you could be doing your homework and studing for an important lest on your on the computer learning nothing, then you will school and possably mess for ever! This is really bad because you were on the computer. A couple times I pushed homework aside to use the computer and my grades drops alot. So this is why @CAPS1 effects education.

Three reasons to support @CAPS2 decision are many jobs use computers, instead of using a dictionary or thesaurus, you can just search it and it is a big help at home/around the house. @CAPS2 first reason is, that many jobs in the state, or nation use a computer. Statistically saying @NUM1 out of @NUM2 jobs in the state use a computer or technology relating to a computer hardware. If you honestly think about it, if you were a teacher, a factory employee, etc, you practicly wouldn't even be able to do your job without it.

If we have learned anything in the past @NUM3 years, it would be the ""@CAPS1 the time you spend on the computer, but go on because you will learn some things you never know before."" @CAPS2 second reason is we have alot more useful search engines than @NUM3 years ago. In/around the @NUM5's, if you wanted to find information, the only resort was...books. Yes, I mean reading is great, but now having the computer is faster and easier. All you do is go to @ORGANIZATION2 and type in what you want to find. Then it comes up in about @NUM6 seconds with around @NUM7 links to websites to help you out. Just think, now theres no table of contents, just a link and a click! @CAPS2 third reason is it is a big help around the house/at home. In the state of @LOCATION1, about @PERCENT1 of people have a laptop or a computer in their home. But, this isn't a bad thing, because it can help with so many things.

You would probley get all fat through the course of the year. You would be like a couch potato. My next opinion is we won't be able to get out of the house to see the beautiful nature. Like all the trees, flowers, wild life animals too. If you don't go outside there will be no fresh air for you. My last opinion is if we have computer. We won't be able to hang out with friends and family. You wont be able to see how big your family is. Or how small they are still small. Well these are my opinion's for having computers."	3	3		6																					
419	1	"The local newspaper wants to know my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Computers do have effect on people. People can meet new people, learn about new places, and talk to friends. Read on so you can learn how computers effect people lifes. My first reason is people can meet new people. You can meet new people from all around the world. You can keep touch with them through @CAPS1 or e-mail. Its a quicker and new way to meet new people. My second reason is you can learn about new places. You can learn new places by just clicking on an webpage. Computers are a faster way to learn. I gives you everything you need to know about the ne places you want to learn about. My third reason is we can talk to friends. Computers have many diffrent social websites that you can talk to people. You wont have to wait for school the next day you can talk to them through the computer. With all this new / quicker stuff you can talk to friend when ever you want. Finally, you know how computers affect people. We can meet new people, learn new places, and talk to friends. Computers can do all these days. Hope you enjoyed reading all about how they affect people."	3	3		6																					
420	1	"Dear @CAPS1 people, Your have been told that using a @CAPS1 can give no knolege, but I agree that it gives you hand-eye cordanation, A @CAPS1 is the most helpful thing in the world. For my first reason, computers have so many technology things inside that help people everyday. I want to talk about interacting with family and friends. You can go on facebook, myspace and even twitter to talk to your friends. Its the most common thing to go on the @CAPS1. About @PERCENT1 teens and adults use myspace and facebook. Litter kids would be like @PERCENT2 use @CAPS2 to interact with some friends. This technology is the most best thing you could ever use. The second reason is, that people need to learn how to use a @CAPS1 and the hand-eye cordination. For learning, you could learn how to type, write stories, using @ORGANIZATION1 word, and even learning whats to use on the internet, for hand-eye cordination, you can learn all the keys an the keyboard and what they do to get better skills. My thirdly reason is, how to search on google or the @LOCATION1. Google is the most common thing that everyone uses. To look up pictures for projects, labs basiclly for anything. And for the dictionary, you can see what words mean and the dictionay is for learning and doing homework. For my conclusion all these reasons are true and computers are the greatest sources on the planet, everyone do you want education or not? computers help everyone. You gotta love it!?!"	4	4		8																					
423	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people in our community use computers for positive ideas. Such as if gives you hadn and eye coordination, gives people the ability to research on far away places and allows you to talk to far away family. This is why I think computers have a positive effect on people. To begin with computers give a positive efect on people because it gives you hand and eye cordination. For example that can help you to have ability to do more. Like work somewhere such as a restraunt. This needs lots of cordination for holding heavy trays. My mom is a waitress and she needs a lot of cordination she tells me. Another reason would be you would have more hand cordination driving because you can react fast. Some people say that computers make you not be able to see while. Which than you would need glasses. But thats there desision this can give you one reason that computers are a positive effect on people today. Secondly why computers are a positive effect because it gives people the ability to search far away places. Why this can be a good thing is because you can get a good idea of what its like and might want to take a trip there. Another reason would be that students usually have projects which call for research in other countries. Computers make kids smarter that way but some people say that kids could get on a website where it can be bad, which also they arn't getting exersize if all there doing is researching when they can do that in the own town. But about @PERCENT1 of kids can stil be on the computer than go and get exersize. This is another reason computers are an impact. Lastly, why computers are positive is kids and adults can talk to there friends or family quicker. For exmaple if a family member lives far away instead of mail you can send it on the computer in a @NUM1 minute send. Its quicker and easier. Another reason is your kids will be able to talk to there friends faster than mail as well. About @PERCENT2 of kids use computers to talk to there friends But some people say kids can think there talking to there friends but could be someone bad. But to make sure all your friends should have one question to make sure its there friend. This is why to computers are a positive impact on young adults, and children, parents. To conclude, I would like to say that computers are a positive impact for a couple reasons one it gives you more hand and eye coordination gives people the ability to search other countries and beable to talk to friends. Others disagree because it can ruin your eyes, not get exersize and lastly give your child unsafe. But that can be changed easily by limiting kids, see who they talk to and get them in a sport. This is why I think computers are a postive impact."	4	5		9																					
426	1	"Dear, @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 has come to my concern that many people are debating on whether computers benefit our society or not. Some people think computers are the lives of many people, but I have to disagree with those who say that. I think that computers benefits our society in there ways, they bring people together, they offer many websites to research a topic, and they let people shop at home. One way that computers help us is that they bring people together by using the internet. Many families do not live close to other relatives, making hard to see them. But with the internet, people can use social networking sites such as facebook or myspace to keep in touch with one another. Distant relatives can talk and share picture with one another to keep in touch. Also, the internet can help bring couple together and potentially lead to marriages. How @MONTH1 times have you seen those @CAPS3 harmony commercial that claim to have brought two singles together to make a happy couple? Another way that computers help today's society is that they offer many places to conduct research on a certain topic. There are so many search engines on the internet that lead you to numerous websites to help you find out what you need to know. Also, researching a topic on the computer is so much easier compared to going to the library and reading books. When using books, to research a topic, you need to find the right book, read the whole thing or at least most of @CAPS2, and find what you're looking for. But with the internet, you just type in what you're looking for, click, and go. Lastly, computers let you shop online and lead to a better shopping experience. By shopping online, you skip the long lines at retail stores which means less time walking to get your product. For example, many people rush to stores early in the @TIME1 for huge sales on ""@CAPS4 @DATE1."" A person could be left waiting in line for hours to get a product. Why wait outside for so long when you could just buy the product in the comfort of your own home and get the product delivered right to your house? Also, many websites offer special deals for shopping online so you can even money. In conclusion, I think that computers benefit our society in three ways, they bring people together, they offer many websites to research a topic, and they let people shop at home. A world without computers would be so much different than the world we live in today."	5	4		9																					
434	1	"I think we need our computers. If we dont have competer's we wont be able to connect to our family that could live in anther state or country. I no how there is texting now but some people dont even have phones or nothing how can you connect to them you cant call it might not be free with the phone palan you have. If a family member coms and visits you they would probuly email you about it but if there is no computers they can't tell when there coming. Are they gong do show unispectly they might not even be home and if they show up without them knowing there out of luck. And we exersize on our overtime we pick what time and we do it and if we play a sport were enjoying nature some people might have job's that take place outside of if. There are nerd's that are on computers all day long but in sure they enjoy nature I dont know about exersizing but they have a car and every thing they drive and things. Also, about the exersizing every on has to exersize to stay in shape im pretty sure people dont want to be fat there whole life they want to look good and feel good about there self. If it is a holiday or something and people want to send them something to wish then of whetever holiday it is. There not gonna be able to see them in person if they live so far away inless they plan to meet each other but even if they do that there gonna want to email then not call were it costs money and texting only comes with sertain plan's of phones so all there is left is emailing. Sometimes, people will more fron of you that your ollways on the computer if your not dont worry at least you get to email your family that you dont ever seen. These reasons are my opinion that dont get rid of computers and other things."	4	3		7																					
441	1	"Dear Local Newspaper: Computers have become a major part of peoples lives. The effects computers have on people are only negative. Nothinggood comes out of using a computer. This is because computers are time consuming from in other activities, computers are not always working which leads to people getting angry, and using computers is bad for your health. I know you have a difficult decision to make but after reading what I have to say, their will be no doubt that you will agree. Using computers is very time consuming. People don't realize how long they have been using the computer. Once you start using it, your hooked and it's hard to stop. A poll was taken and out of @NUM1 kids, @NUM2 of them said they felt groggy and had headaches, after using a computer for two hours. The way computers make you feel is not enjoyable. But while your using the computer it's entertaining, for example, your on @CAPS1 and your talking to your friend and your laughing at them & enjoying yourself, but it's not the computer that's making you happy, it's the person, you might as well see them in person. There for, computers are time consuming & should not be used. Copmputers are not reliable, they have minds of their own. Many people do always rely on their computer and when it doesn't work it causes the person to get angry or frustated. Computers have a vast impact on people, but they shouldn't have to. Dr. @PERSON2 at @ORGANIZATION1 says that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2's frustration & anger is caused by non-working computers. If the use of computers was lowered anger that people have would lower and would lead to other positive things as well. Furthermore, computers are not realiable and cause people to get angry. My final reason is that, computers cause health issues and cause people to be lazy. The obesity rate is higher than ever and people sitting on the computer all day is not helping. @PERCENT2 of obesity is caused by the use of computers. @PERSON1 at @ORGANIZATION2 says that @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people who don't use computers are much healthier because instead of using computers they exercise. There for, computers cause health issues. In conclusion, computers effect people because they are time consuming, you can't rely on then and it's bad for your health. There for, computers have negative effects on people. "	4	4		8																					
443	1	"Dear @CAPS1 I support that computers have a positive effect on people because they have so many things to do and learn on the computer, because on the computer you can look up many things like sports, animal world history and lot more. The reason I support this is because I like to look up history about @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 pioneer who have changed humanity. The @CAPS4 reason why I say computer effect people is because it teaches you how to type faster and know now to get certain places on the computer for example say you mom was asked you do you know how to get to a certain website to buy new furniture. @CAPS6 third reason of how computers effect people is if say one day you had to do a project, on what happen during @CAPS2 revolution and you were one of those people that spend all their time looking up @CAPS2 revolution on the computer. That means that project should be real easy. The @CAPS4 reason why I say computers affect people is because they teache better communicating skills on things like facebook and @CAPS5, because when I'm in school kids tell each other to go on there facebook when they get home. I also think computer affect people because say you have a idol and wan't to look up that person for example I like football, basketball @CAPS6 idols are @PERSON1 peterson and @PERSON2 iverson, so everytime I go on the computer I look up both of @CAPS6 idols. @CAPS6 last reason why I say computers effect people are because they teach how to read because everytime on the computer haves something to read about no matter what it is."	4	4		8																					
447	1	"Dear newspaper, In my opinion, computers definetely have a negative effect on people. People who use computers often spend less time exercising. I mean, who would give up their chatrooms and games to get in shape? I remember when i was a little girl - about @NUM1 years old, and i always wanted to be on the computer. I soon got chubby and gained about @NUM2 lbs! I quickly realized the computer is a tool used only when necessary. because it shortens activity time. A survey done by the @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS1) showed that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS4 between ages @NUM3 are overweight because of their computer use. Famous singer @PERSON2 says. ""I keep going and losing weight because of computers! I will gain weight and then run it off and ignore the computer for a week."" I know you might be thinking that computers dont make you obese if you use it sparingly, but research has proven that more than @NUM4 mins a day can make you gain fat. Clearly, computers are to blame for our society's weight problem. Have you ever really seen nature's beauty? People who use computers don't! I mean, people are too busy looking up things on the web that nobody can truly appreciate. the outside world. I remember when i watched the movie @CAPS2 last week, I thought to myself, ""@CAPS3, nature is amazing, why didn't I notice before?"" I already know the answer. Computer, A survey conducted by @NUM5 grade @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1 showed that @NUM6 out of @NUM7 @CAPS4 have never noticed the blooming flowers or the smell of fresh rain. Famous physician, @PERSON4, ""@CAPS4 that dont see nature for its true beauty often can't grow up normally. People were supposed to be naked to nature, but over the years, technology has diminished that connection."" I know you @MONTH1 that that @CAPS4 see enough of nature even with computers but more than often., @CAPS4 dont pay attention to nature. They are too busy with computers. Obviously, nature is ignored by society because of computers. Familes grow more and more detached every time a child or even adult uses a computer. I mean, every time you hit that on switch, you and the computer become attached. You can't focus on the people around you. I remember when my sister @PERSON5 was in @NUM5 grade, she never took her eyes off the computer. She would play solitore and instant message her friends all the time and she then completely disconnected with the family. A test done by @ORGANIZATION3 showed that teens will rebel @NUM9 times more than usual with the aid of a computer. Famous talk-show host, @PERSON3 says, ""@CAPS4 shouldn't use computer, they will get detached from friends and family."" I know you're thinking @CAPS4 dont get detached, but they di. Clearly @CAPS4 seperate from their friends and family because of computers. In conclusion, any far minded person can tell that computers have a negative effect on people because they consume exercise time, make @CAPS4 forget about nature, and seperate family and friends. Therefore, I urge you to not use computers!"	6	5		11																					
453	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that computers have positive and negative effects on people. In the past their have been more negative effects on people. In a survey taken in @CAPS2 magazines @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT1 of people, have negative effects with computers. Inmy opinion, I think comuters have a negative effect on people. First, people are not interacting with family and friends. @CAPS1 is very important to have interactions with people. When on the computer your not really interacting with. You just sit there staring at a screen. In a survey taken at @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT2 of people are on computer and not interacting with the people around them. Parents don't se etheir kids as much because they are always on the computer. Parents would love to see their kids move. Interacting with their family and friends will be healthy to them. Computers take the away fromhanging out with family and friend. Secondly, people don't get to enjoy nature. People on computer might go outside because they are involved with the computer. Stay in one room doing the thing for books for a @CAPS5 in a while people need fresh air. too but learning about nature is more nature. If you dont enjoy nature you dont know what is going on.NAture is all around us and why would you miss out on. in a survey taken in a local magazine @CAPS1 should that @PERCENT2 of people are on computer and. While people enjoy computer, nature. Lastly, people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising. Exercise is important for the mind and body. Our bodies need to stay healthy and fit. The lack of exercise is increasing fast. The more people get computers the people exercise. America is over weight already to join the People on computers most just long to become over weight. People rather play on computer that got exercise for a healthy body. Dr. @DR1 a local doctor, has seen more people become over weight and not exercise as much as they used to. He says computers do not provide exercise. He recommends that people use their computers less computers are doing more. In conclusion, I think computer negative effect on. My three reasons are that people are not interacting with friends and family, not enjoying nature and getting less exercise. I you to be in of negative effects on people. @CAPS1's important decision is up to you. "	4	5		9																					
454	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, To start off I would like to give my opinion on using compuers too much. Although I use a computer a lot I still have fun with friends and play sports. But to much time on the computer can cause you noth wanting to get exercise or maybe getting sick easier. Spending so much time on the computer can cause a kid to be shy in the outside life. Exerasing is very healthy for kids and adulst. there are way to many people on computers doing anything you can think of for hours. Staring at a computer screen for a long amount of time will not keep you fit or in shape. People should have a minimal amount of time of @NUM1 minutes each day and then get some exercise. this way you would get time for being on the internet and still doing what's good for you, I shouldn't feel bad about the people who waste all their time on the computer but I do. To see them getting gross and gaining weight from lack of exercise makes we want to help htem @CAPS4 one should put themselves into that kind of situation. What I've noticed about people who stay online a lot is that they get sick more often. From sitting there like lazy bums they don't get fresh-air. Not getting enough fresh-air can cause a cold or for some people with problems to get very sick. They need to think twice about what they're getting themselves into. I would rather be having fun and getting nice fresh-air then sitting on the computer about to be sick. It can be a different story if you went home sick from work/school and went on the computer. but being sick from the computer is gross. Even though to say, people who are on the computer often are shy in person. If someone gets in a fight on the internet that can cause them so much pain to not even talk. Interacting with people is very nice and touching. But being shy and lonely because of a fight on the computer or from being on it too much, is something to be ashamed of you shouldn't have to be that way because of one thing. Get out in the world and don't let things like that get to you. To this off, it would be nice for people to take care of themselves and not stay on the internet for so long. Remind yourself to have atleast @NUM1 minutes to yourself and to do waht you want but get some exercise also. Don't forget about staying healthy and going for a jog once in a while. You shouldn't focus your life on your computer. Thank you and have a great day."	4	4		8																					
459	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion computers are wonderfull to the society in many ways. They can keep memories we cant keep forever like @CAPS3, @CAPS1's, and type letters. Computers also can give you dieting tips and advice from live locals. But, important of all of it, family that you miss can talk to you for hours without a phone bill. To begin, computer can give you @CAPS2 tips on things you didn't know, so it can also be a learning center. For example: your extremely stresed out because you have a huge paper to do but have no facts, there are a millions websites you could go to find your answers on. The next day you get your paper back and theres a A stamped right across it. Another @CAPS2 thing about computers is that you can talk to your family members all the way in a different city, town, state, or even content! you @MONTH1 miss them alot but you can always see them to them or type to them to let that sad feelings melt away for a little bit. Every @NUM1 in @NUM2 americans say missing or not seeing a family member is like letting a little piece of your heart fall off. Everybody knows what its like to have a memory that you could never forget:  but what about those little memories that @CAPS3, websites, and written work seems to slip away from the brain. Computers save all of that so the ""I know its to its like to loose its like a little part of life that you have lived walks always"" exclaims @PERSON1 who could This is exactly why computer in many ways. I hope you are @CAPS2 for the mind, tips and family."	4	4		8																					
461	1	"Dear The Local Newspaper, I do @CAPS1 computers effect people. But in many different ways. Also, depending on how long you are on the computer for. In my opinion @CAPS1 computers are good, for many reasons. I will tell you some of the reasons why I @CAPS1 this. Hopefully, after you read this you'll @CAPS1 about it more. One reason computers are good, is the communication. @CAPS2 are many different web sites to go on and talk to friends and family. If you had a family member far away, this could be a good way to talk to them. This also is a way to see your friends with the latest technology you can videchat. Videochat is a way to see and hear your friends by a little camera. It is a very good way to keep intouch with people you know. Another reason is that you can get a lot of information from the computer @CAPS2 are so many websites that provide answers to all your questions. Websites like @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 recommend other sites to go resaerch. You can learn a lot from computers. The information provided on the computer can really teach everyone something. Lastly, a computer can help you with many things. Such as online classes, matchmakeing, jobs, and so much more. You can find things to do, by just typing it into the computer. The economy is very bad, but you can look for jobs. Then once they find one your interested in they'll tell you. It's a very good and helpful way for you, and it's so simple. Computers are an amazing, and new technology. They keep coming up with more and more. So why not use it? It can teach you something and help you. Also, to stay in touch with family and friends. Don't take it for advantage, but use it well. It's only a click of a button. I hope I made you all realize what a computer is really @CAPS2 for. Maybe, even changed your minds or gave you a different way of thinking about computers."	4	4		8																					
464	1	"Dr. @DR1, The effects computers have on people and why people dont agrees that this benefits society and some people us it to be online to talk to friend and family. Whey people dont agrees to use the computer. First the computer we could use at for every thing like go to other place you want to visit. Then @CAPS1 you want to work or go to another school some you need to do it by computer. Why not try to use the computer. I know computer is a lot of money but sometime @NUM1 good to have it. @CAPS1 people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. For example some family and friends are not in the same place and they cant see each other the could write to each other online @CAPS1 they dont have cell phone of house phone. Then @CAPS1 people want to enjoy other nature that they dont know the could use the computer and look for the place. The three reson is that people could do exercising trough computer. It dont mather @CAPS1 the spend a lot of time in the computer being people could be doing a lot of thing in the computer. Like student we do a lot of projet in the computer we search for any can or thing. So people think that compute is fun for them. Finally other people that don't agrees they should try it.

468	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I've heard reports from both the news on @CAPS2.V. and your paper that more and more people are turned in to nothing but their computers. I'm not saying it's a bad thing I mean the computer has the internet which allows you to go to anything like websites and online chatting. I just think that people should get outside more often and do some outdoor things like football, basketball, baseball or if you're an adult you could get a job that doesn'@CAPS2 require a computer like for example building houses for homless people, shelters for animals, or have a job as a maitnence man, pool lifeguard, or any other job at a hotel that doesn'@CAPS2 involve a computer. You could work at a restaurant that has regular food or fast food service. Something that does'ent involve a computer. But if you can'@CAPS2 get out of the house you could do something a little different from computers video games. They maybe similar to the computer but they are something you can do on the @CAPS2.v. and it beats playing on the computer all the time."	4	4		8																					
471	1	I believe that computers benefit society. They make life easier. Computers allow now of communication between friends. They also teach you new things. Computers make our lives easier. They let us look things up by easier means than a person or book. It has made it simpler to type reports. Now you don't have to worry about making mistakes on a typewriters and having to type it again. A computer saves the report and shows you some mistakes to take case of your children. It allows you to from your home. Computers allow new means of communication. You can talk online with friends. Social networks such as @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 allow that. Computers allow you to converse with friends you don't normally get to see or talk to. They also make it easier and more fun to make new friends. Computers teach us new things. They teach you about places you haven't seen before. Any question you can be asked on the internet and you will get an answer. It gives you answer you don't know who to ask for. Computers also teach hand-eye coordination. You can play games online or with @CAPS3's. You need to have good hand-eye coordination in order to play these games. Computers have a positive effect on people of all ages. They make our lives easier with their technology. They allow us to communicate with our friends through social networks. Computers also teach us new things such as hand-eye coordination. All these reasons and more are why I believe that computers benefit our society.	4	4		8																					
472	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 technology majors support that the use of computers have a positive effect on people and I agree with them. I believe the use of computers are a necesity for social interaction, homework, research, and are a great source of entertainment on a rainy day. After a long day at school @CAPS1 teens go from the bus, to the front door, to their computer chair. In fact, @PERCENT1 of must teens do so. Odds are they're logging into facebook, myspace, formspring, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, and other socially interactive websites. With good time management I actually find these websites important. I think facebook and e-mail and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ( @CAPS5) are a great way to be socially interactive. It's also a great way to keep in touch with long distance family or friends. I go to @DATE1 camp and have made friends I call my family. Some of them being across the ocean in @LOCATION2. Seeing as how I can't make long distance calls which would cost way too much money, facebook is a geat alternative to keep in touch. @CAPS1 of my family also live far away. For example, my aunt, uncle and cousin in @LOCATION1. My aunt just had a baby, meaning I have a new cousin which I'm not able to see in person yet so seeing pictures on facebook instead of spending money on envolopes, stamps and picture prints is really awesome @CAPS1 homework given out in school requires a computer. Three out of five homework assignments are on the computer. Whether it be taking a twenty question test to defining a word the computer is a schoolwork necesity. In school now many projects are assigned meaning we need the computer and internet. We use powerpoint and other microsoft documents whether it be typing an essay or creating a powerpoint slideshow. We need the internet for research to get the information we need, to suceed. Aside from interacting with other humans and researching and typing the computer holds many more wonders. Many people believe people are spending way too much time on the computer. While this @MONTH1 be true for some people it is not true for @CAPS1. Many people are concerned children are becoming lazy but in a recent vote @NUM1 out of @NUM2 mothers said they'd radther see their children playing and interacting on the computer then being a couch patato and watching @CAPS6. On a rainy day the computer can be a great alternative. You can slide in a @CAPS7 and watch a movie or play a game or even research something new and learn about it. @NUM3 out of @NUM2 @CAPS8 have at least two computers in the house for a reason. They're important to @CAPS1 people everyday lives. The computer is a great way to keep in touch with family and friends. You also need to computer for school almost all the time and on a rainy day its a great alternative then being lazy a watching @CAPS6 while your eyes fall asleep. I do believe computers have a positive effect on people."	6	6		12																					
473	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 i think it it good and bad. The good is it teaches people about @CAPS1 places and how other people live in there soicty what they do to get food or how they raise there kids. It also help people like cops. Because the have a person there looking for they have the computer to look on. It also help cops as in a speeder they can see it her or she have done it befor. It helps teaches to get a lesson or line to teach or they will put you on line to help you with your typeing. Yes it dose have a positive effect on some people. So people think they do a lot better around the computer or they do there best work online. Like say a high school paper. Yes you can talk to other people online get @CAPS1 friends. On the other hand computers can be bad as in you meet people online you don't know who that person is or where they come from. They might have a long crimal. They might be some on want to get you in troble because of his or her family problems. Some people spend to much time on the computer because they meet some one they rally like and don't worry about what the family want to do. So people use to work out every day but now they can talk to they friend all night and all day they stop and forget about it and never start agine. Some people just stay in the and stay on the computer got playing baceball or football or going to family reunions.	3	4		7																					
478	1	"Computers are used everywhere, for thousands of different things. Many of @LOCATION1 spend hours glued to our computer screen everyday. Being very reliant on your computer is not always good for you. @DATE1 too many people spend countless hours on their computers, rather than doing other activities. Therefore, computers are not the best way to spend your time because you get less excersize, your school grades can lower, and your communication skills will weaken. First, when spending days on your keyboard you will have less time to run or play with your friends. In the @LOCATION1 @DATE1, many more people are becoming obese, creating unhealthy genes to be passed on. Perhaps a reason for this is that too many people can just sit on their laptops to shop, see movies, and even to get a college education. Less and less people go for walks because they would rather be on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1. Without the constant use of computers there would be more free time for people to get outside, or play sports. Secondly, many kids and teens are attached to their laptop, and bring it everywhere with them. So, rather than studying for their tests, they could be on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1. Must chose to go on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1 rather than opening their books. Plus, spending so many hours on a computer. less time to do their homework, so they just begin to not do any of it. Computers take away their time that could be used towards getting a college education, why waste them? Lastly, why talk on the phone or in person when you can just send them an e-mail or chat online with them? Many people @DATE1 are staying inside on their laptops to talk to a person rather than doing it face to face. This can cause a lack of communication skills, something that might sound good online, could sound absolutely terrible in the ""real"" world. This loss of skill, could lead to a generation of more cyber talk rather than @CAPS3. In conclusion, why spend so many hours on the computer when you could be outside, or hanging out with friends? Personally I'd prefer to go and do something rather than being stuck inside on a computer."	4	4		8																					
480	1	"Do you really think computers have a positive affect? Don't you think way to many people are on their computer to long? You want me to write an to my local newspaper about what I think on the effects they give people. I think they have a horrible effect on people. @CAPS2 people are on the computer doing something it can give them headachs, eye sales but if they were outside they would be exerssing. One of the reasons f think computers have a bad effect on people is addictions. Their are many things people @MONTH1 get addicted to life facebook, myspace, formspring. another example, @CAPS2 my sister gets home first thing. She does is go on facebook, forming and youtube. My second reason who f think computers have terrible effect is because eye damage. @CAPS2 your staring at a computer screen for so long you don't notice but your eyes are getting damage. @CAPS2 f was in sixth grade I needed glasses because I was addicted to computer for so long and my eyes got damaged. My first reason @CAPS1 I think computers have terrible effect on people is because its a waste of time. @CAPS2 your at home on the computer and it's sum out you should be outside with friends, family, or even just a talking a walk, and it's also a waste of time because @CAPS2 your on computer you could also be instead. You might think they have positive effect yes, but they damage your body. these are the reason @CAPS1 I think computers have a bad effect on people. Instead of being on the computer join a sports club. Now is the time to take action but making more clubs or activities to people. the issue is people was to much time on computer. these are my reasons @CAPS1 computers have terrible effect on people."	4	4		8																					
488	1	"Computers have little to no effect on people. In fact computers help us out a lot. They help us in find @CAPS1, medical, research and to tell weather or not you have cancer. The computers that people think of are machines that sit in a room and is used often but not for its purpose. People use it sometimes for entertainment not research. There aren't just those kind of computers. There are bigger more advanced computers that scientist use every day. @CAPS2 computers do have an effect on us, but in a good way. Most of the time those people playing games or music are kids who are bopard. They use it a little too often. I anly play with it on rainy days when I can't go outside and play. Humans use computers mainly because it makes life simpler, easier. @CAPS2, it does make life simpler, like for example instead of handwriting a report, you can type it or intead of searching everywhere in a book, you can go straight to the information. One last example is; when you want to stay updated on your favorite sport team, you don't have to go to their game you just have to go to their web site. In my opinion I say that @CAPS2, computers do have and effect on us but a good reason. I'm a sports fan so I play a lot of sports. I use the computer offer for fun and research. It dosen't have an effect on me. It dosen't effect at all because I still exercise a play with my friends very often, like everyday. There is no reason to why people can't use computers quite often. Computers don't have a positive effect sometime, but it doesn't have a negitive effect sometime either. I exercise, enjoy nature and interact with friends and family too. I also use the computer often. Experts shouldn't be concerned with people using computers too much."	4	4		8																					
492	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I heard what you were saying about if computers are a good or bad thing. I personally think that compueters are a bad thing. Three reason for this are, kids don't get any exercise people are doing innapropirate things on them, and they could lead to giving out too much info, which could lead to injury or death. The first reason is that for the amount of time that someone uses a computer, they could be outside enjoying the nice weather well, if it is a nice day of course! I mean you have to agree with me on this one, the main reasons why people are becoming obese because of some kind of technology computers. The second reason why computers are a bad thing is because some people are doing innapropriate thing on them. If people are doing such innapropriate things on them why don't the makers of the computers block them? I don't know, I mean what kind of sicko would put those sites up even? From what I have learned in computer class, they can be used for more innapropriate things than I ever even knew of! The @CAPS1 and final reason why computer technology could be a bad thing is because some people have given too much info away on them and have gotten injured by internet world @MONTH1 look like fun and games untill someone gets hurts, well thats what my mom says! In conclusion, as you can probally see I am really not a fan of the computer. The reasons why I don't like it are kids don't get enough exercise, kids are doing innapropriate things in it, and it has been used for injury and sometimes death. These are the reasons why the computers is a bad thing, so remember these tips, take this article into consideration."	3	4		7																					
500	1	"Dear local news paper, I agree that technology has a positive effect on people. Just like other electronic devices, computers can help you with hand eye coordination. Plus, some people like teachers, want to get staff off the internate for their students to learn about people and places. Others just want to talk to other family or friend member in other towns, states, countries, or continents. Once you read this letter, then you will understand my reasoning. Firstly, these technology enhanced dictionaries help you with hand-eye coordination. Before the computer, people had lose success in writing quickly. They had to make short notes or short handed notation like w/ or. Nowadays people write quicker and can write full words and sentences. They never understood what they wrote they put it in full sentences. When you play computer games, it gives you even more hand-eye coordination, That was only the first three reasons. Secondly, teachers use computers to get alot of school work and get information about history and geography. like an online school book, it can get information on just about anything. It can look up when @PERSON1 was born. When the dinosaurs went extinct. Fun what the government is doing now. A computer can store what you learn too. It also has search engines that help you locate the information like @ORGANIZATION1 or @ORGANIZATION2. Statistics show that more than @PERCENT1 of people on earth use search engine to find something on the computer. On search engines they have websites, pictures, movies, maps and more. That is why people use computer for research. Have you ever fell like you don't want to travel across the @LOCATION2 just to see your relative. Well I have a solution to your problem. Computers have all sorts of stuff to can fanicate to other people. The computer mostly uses e-mail. E-mail is like a letter, but put electronically. It also has @CAPS1. It is also like a letter. If you buy a special camera that connects to your computer you can talk to them personaly. You don't even have to travel to see your relatives in @LOCATION1. That is the last reason why computers have positive effects on people. Most people use computers effectively. They get hand eye coordination. Also, the learn important facts about places and people. Plus they can talk to other people. See what I mean, computers are some and also a positive part of society."	5	5		10																					
508	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 since electricity was invented technology has developed at a rapid rate. Computers have gone from the size of a room to twelve inch flat screen monitors. In our modern day society computers are crucial tools that help organize files, do reasearch, and pleasurable online networking. Computers teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and allow people to socialize online. Without computers wouldn't life be difficult? While routinely doing our everyday computer tasks seldom do we realize that we are writing which frequently over works nerves in the hand causing tendonitis or arthritis; typing on computers is quicker and less harmful to the hands. ""Hand eye coordination helps improve balance and athleticisniry."" said @PERSON1 the chief othopedic sergeon of @ORGANIZATION1. Some people beg to differ and believe spending not less time on the computer can contribute to lack of physical activity. There are several portible computer devices that can be brought outside to use while walking like a @CAPS3. Every since I was, ten years old I dreamed of going to @LOCATION1. Although I couldn't afford a plane ticket to @LOCATION1, I was able to use the internet to take virtual tours of the vibrant landscapes and ancient historic venues throughout the country. With the help of internet I was able to see a far away place and experience the country as if I was there. @PERSON2, the creator of an online webcom called @ORGANIZATION2. @PERSON2 created this computer system in order to allow people to connect all over the world by giving them the opportunity to see and speak to anyone they chosse to. I frequently use this program to talk to my sister at college. Through this program we can't socialize with as if she's at home and learn about her college experience."	5	4		9																					
511	1	"Dear Newspaper, I think a computer is not something bad for you. A computer can help you do many things @CAPS1 could help you learn, chat with friends, and @CAPS1 can entertain you. A computer can get you sucessful in life @CAPS1 helps you learn a lot of things such as computer engineering. Computer engineering is a job that pays you good money to fix computers. @CAPS1 is very challenging at first, but when you look @CAPS1 up on search websites you'll find all your answers. Chatting is the number one thing kids, adults , and teenagers do. @CAPS1 is good and bad in a way, @CAPS1 is good because because your phone bill wont be that high up so you save minutes. @CAPS1 is bad because @CAPS1 can also ruin your eyes just remeber dont get to close to the screen. The computer is all about fun, you have millions of websites you can go on. To have fun for example @CAPS2.com, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS3.com those are the three main ones I go on they are so fun. They have tons of games for kids and for adults too. I Have proven my point that computers are not bad for you because they can help you learn, they lower your phone bill, and its also very fun. Yes I know they might take exercise time away, or hurt your eyes but who cares just make up a time limit so you have time to exercise. Do not get to close to the screen because @CAPS1 can hurt your eyes."	4	4		8																					
516	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have recently heard about the debate on whether or not computers are used too often. Computers can be unhealthy, I think that generally they're helpful. They give us many oportunities that wouldn't exist without them. I'll describe more of what I mean in the following letter. First, I'll explain one of the advantages of computers. Studying and school work. Computers can provide people with ways to research things. For students, it @MONTH1 be something like research for a project of essay. For adults it could be information on starting a business. In both of those cases, computers were used to get information in a simpler way then perhaps visiting a library, I, personally, know of a website called @LOCATION1, where teachers can set up online tests for students. This would not be possible without computers. Computer online courses can even taken, where a student can be taugh through the internet, rather than in person. This can be an advantage to someone that can't always get to classes. I would also like to mention that computers provide a popular form of communication. E-mail and I @CAPS3. These methods of communication have become extreamly popular recently, and I myself use both. I think for some people it can be bad because it prevents them from interacting with the real world. But in general I think it's helpful. It also gives parents and teachers another way to communicate. These are just some of the many ways computers are helpful. Lastly, I'd just like to talk about how computers can benefit adults specifically. I know that many people pay their bills online. This is becaus if you think about it, isn't it a hassle to have to mail your bills every month? Computers greatly reduce that hassle. They can also make it easier to buy things you need, look for jobs, and many other things. Without computers, things like looking for jobs would require a lot more work than they do with them. These, again, are only some of the hundreds, if not thousands of ways which computers are helpful. In conclusion, I think I've made my point very clear. Any thing in moderation is okay. People that argue that computers are unhealthy speak of those who use computers too much. Generally this is not the case. Usually computers can do much more good than bad, and can make a persons life much easier. They help very much with education, and even that alone I think should be enough to convince you that computers are helpful. But as I said, I hope I made my point clear, and I hope you agree with me."	4	4		8																					
518	1	"Dear local newspaper, More and more people are using computers there days. Some people think computers are an improvements to society. Others are concerned that people spent too much time on computers and not enough time exercising and spending time with friends and family. I believe that computers can be a bad thing. I think this because some people spend to much time on them,, it's one of the leading causes of obesity, and it interfers with people social lifes. According to recent studys, about @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people spend most of their time on their computers. Many ot these people spend their time on online games and socializing websites such as facebook and myspace. Others spend it shopping or learning. Some of the online games include world of warcraft, rune scope, and many @CAPS1's @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 games. Many people who spend most of their time on the computer are or @MONTH1 became obese. According to @PERSON1, spending alot of time on computer is one of the main reasons for obesity. Many experts agree that computers are the learning cause of obesity. between @DATE1 and @DATE2 more people have been using their computers more often. The obesity rate has increased between then too. Most of the people who spend alot of time on the computer don't interact with their friend and family much. This can lead to ruined relationships, loss of friends and the chance of losing your love with family. Many experts, such as @PERSON2, say that a person can become depressed from not interacting with friends and family. He also says some of the people who became depressed start thinking of suicide. Spending too much time on the computer is a bad thing would you want to spend too much time on the computer even ater hearing the cons of it? I believe spending too much time on the computer is bad for everyone."	4	4		8																					
527	1	"@DATE1 @CAPS1 The @CAPS2, I believe that computers in today's society have a possitve affect on people. I believe this because if people use it for education purposes to chat, email, or to reasearch it does make a difference in peoples lives. If you use the computer for educational purposes like games, you could really learn a lot. For example, I help my sister with her multiplication on a math game we have. Also, I learned to type with type to learn @CAPS3. on my desktop computer at home. Many other people use it for these reasons too. They also might use it for typing a project or making a presentation. Others might only use it for chat and e-mail. These things can still benefit our society though. Using the computer for chat, such as, facebook, myspace, and twitter can also benefit our society today. These websites benefit us because we can meet new people, catch up with old friends, or even talk with carrent friends. also on @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION1, or @ORGANIZATION3 we can e-mail people instead of instant messaging them. For example, if you have something really big to say to someone you might want to write on email. If you just want to say hello you could use facebook, myspace, or twitter if you have an account. Computers do benefit our society today. All of the reasons in my letter support my position on wether or not computers benefit our society."	4	4		8																					
529	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I agree that the effects computers have on people can be very negative to people, but they should realize what they are doing to themselfs and what they can get themselves into. Starting with people are on the computers more then they are using the phone, this takes effects on people sitting around on their computers and not cleaning their homes and taking care of their homes; but instead they are on the laptops or desktops. Secondly parents and childrens spend most of they time on websites to talk with their friends for example webcam and aim, this takes affect people because they can go on the phone or meet them up some place. In conclusion, people, but mostly teenagers and a little bit of adults up to ages @NUM1 to @NUM2 like to go on different websites sum as myspace.com, facebook.com, formspring.com, and more this constart rumors and can end up in bad or goods situations this can be a horrified effection on these people that do this very often. Some people and mostly teens, and that can be caused it will always be a he say she say, this is why people should log off immediantly. Most importantly people should become aware of themselves or people they might know or might know, knowing this putting into negative situations @MONTH1 at them in harm."	3	4		7																					
535	1	"In my opinion having computer is good to have. Therefore I think having computers are a good thing because nowadays computers are very useful. Also a lot of people are using the for there businesses. My there reasons are to look up information, home work, and to talk to friends and family online. My first reason is to look up information on the computer. If you have thred reports to do it will best to use a computer to look up the information because it will be easier and faster to do. For an example using the internent will be faster then looking for it in a book. For that it will take at least @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes for the interenant if you were to lookingit in a book it can take at least @NUM3 to @NUM4 minutes. My second reason is to you could talk to your friends and family online like if one of your relatives live long distance like in @LOCATION2 then you can talk to them on your telephone or cellphone because the bill will outragouse. Or if you talk to your friends online so can ask them a question on homework or whats the homework? Like if you have a that to like @LOCATION1 you can to online and you can talk to them. My third reason is that you can even do your homework on the computer. If you have history you can go on a website for an online book instead of bringing a book to school and back to home. Also it will be easier for that you would not have to worry about bringing your history book with to home. For the example it will take less time using the interneat the using a book it will take like @NUM5 to @NUM2 minutes using the computer then using the book for @NUM5 to @NUM8 minutes. In my conclusion using a computer is very useful and very important nowadays. My three reasons are to look up information, homework and talking online to friends and family. Even though people don't like computers or don't like to use them."	4	4		8																					
542	1	"Let's go back around @NUM1 years ago. Those were days when it could take weeks to communicate with out of state family. Days when knowledge was only found in books, and ofen found slowly. Those were days where everything was done with a lack of speed and precision. Computers change all that. With nothing but the tap of a finger, we can communicate with people worldwide, or sea the web for some knew information. @PERCENT1 of people's relatives live out of their state. I can relate, with @NUM2 cousins in @LOCATION2 and @NUM2 in @LOCATION1. Without these instant messages and emails, we would more than likely talk to them once, maybe twice a year! Some people say that computers make people spend less time interacting with family and friends. For me personally, and I know many others, interaction would be impossible without these modern manuals. With all the @LOCATION1 technology out there. Nothing has me as amazed as the webcam. You, with this tool, can talk face to face with someone on the other side of the world! The world is a better place when we can have a true connection to other cultures, and what better way than to talk to them. What people @NUM4 years ago would never think possible, we can use at a moments notice, and yet still, many people don't appreciate it. My @CAPS1 and my @CAPS2 have both used internet to reunite with old college buddies, or see how far away friends are. These are grown ups, using the tools available to improve their lives. Internet goes beyond teenagers on @CAPS3 and @CAPS4. What you can find online still amazes me. The information you could get out of @NUM2 non-function books, you could find in turn minutes on the internet. Any question, including personal, anything, can be answered. Years ago people would have killed for this power, for the common man to be able to access all he ever needed to. I see the point people make about needing excersize and they're right. But in five minutes on the web you could have an exersize routine planned out, with modern techniques and styles. The computer has anything for anyone. Looking for some place to enjoy nature & @ORGANIZATION1 it. In seconds there will be thousands thousands of results. Missing a dictionary? There are literaly hundreds of sites to find a definition online. People take these machines for granted and assume we could live without them, but I doubt they ever realize how much we really need them. The technology is there. Why not use it? I could never turn down an opportunity to talk to a distant cousin, or another kid from a different country. I couldn't pass up a chance to check up on some old buddies that moved away. Thanks to computers, I have that opportunity. I have that chance. I've been shown an open door to find out everything I could want. Man can't know everything. But these days, he can find out anything. I'm not sure if the omputer has changed the direction of advancing technology, but I can tell you, it has definitly offered the course."	5	5		10

548	1	"Dear Newspaper, Computers are not something to be afraid of. They help many people in different ways, like the @CAPS1, teachers, students, scientists, and locals dealing with their jobs and daily life. Hasn't a computer already helped you today? Because of that, computers help us learn, keep in contact with people, and are our future. Who has said that by using computers you dont interact with your family as much? Well, I can tell you that I'm staying in contact with my grandma, cousins, and aunts through my e-mail. With e-mail you can check up on news or simply write to friends and family! Also, if you are planning a trip to visit your loving family members, dont bother with a map that gets in your face all the time and you just ""happen"" to get lost, try going on @ORGANIZATION1 maps and plan the shortest route to your destination without getting lost along the way. Computers can do more than creating a simple map, it can give you precious information! Many schools across the country use computers to help teach kids. The kids can look up @LOCATION1 and in @NUM1 seconds they have all the information they need! In most school paper you have to type and provide what websites you used to achieve finishing the paper. What is also nice is that you dont need to go through huge books for one small piece of information. It is much easier, looking it up on the computer. Speaking of not using big books for imformation computers don't use paper and will lead us to a healthier tomorrow! Millions of toms of paper land in landfills each day! By using computers we could read online and conserve paper! Another fantastic fact is that computers will grow in the future. people have already created touch-screen computers and computers will grow even more! Many people think that using computers is a bad thing, but look at the facts! Doesnt the newspaper write the newspaper on computers? If they didnt, they would be having hand cramps all the time! And what about docters dont they have your medical history on the computer, if not all these papers would get lost! Like in the beginning, computers help us learn, keep in contact with people, and are our future."	4	4		8																					
565	1	"Dear Newspaper, The world that we live in today is full of technology. Everything from check out isles at the grocery store to coffee makers at home are being upgraded all the time. The technology has many great things about it, but theres also a huge down fall. The most common technolgy device is the computer, its a great thing to have but its also very bad. The computer can be used to bully, it can take time from exercising and it even takes from your social and grammer skills. We all know the websites such as facebook, myspace and @CAPS1. They sseem harmless but its really just a place for harassment. Their said to keep friends in touch, butkids use them to say hurtful things about each other. Half the kids in my eighth grede class have admitted to either getting bullied or bulling over the computer. If so many kids are getting hurt by the then why do we all keep using computers? Many kids @MONTH1 say they don't spend to much time on their computers but @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids in my school admit that they do. Checking the computer is the first thing they do when they get home from school and the last thing hey do before going to sleep at night. All the time these kids spend on the computer is taking away from exercising and enjoying life as a child. I've seen many kids gain exessive amount of weight because they don't eat proper food they don't exercise and they shut down from reality all because they are obsessed with their computers. kids are even getting portable computers, thats how addicted they are. Do you want your kids like that? However, all these programs and websites that are on computers have a way to inneract with friends, and socialize. But all of this is taking away from your social skills, even grammer. Most kids and teenagers would rather talk over the internet thant face to face, and half the time they don't even spell word correct or use proper grammer. In the long run all this talking over computers is going to hurt them when it comes to school and getting a job. I know that computers are good for school because you can research stuff for projects and e-mail your job. But the time spent, kids getting bullied, and the now lack of social skills is not worth it. We need to cutback on our societys use of computers because it will help us all when it really counts. Just ask yourself do you want your kids getting bullied? Do you want to gain weight? Do you want to loose your social and grammer skill? Just ask yourself these questions and you just might change your mind."	5	4		9																					
567	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think that computers can be a good thing and a bed thing for many resons. First i think it's good because it can help school work like to do a research and for other things that you might have to do for school. A secound reson on why computers are helpful is because it teaches hand-eye coordination. It also can have people talk to their family member from a other country through a web-cam. All their computers can be realy helpful they can also be bad for your health and family. I agree that it can give less time exercising, instead of being on the computer you can go to the park or walk your and many other things then just bring on the comuter all day. It can also distroy your interacting with family and and friend if you stay in the house all the time useing the computers and your family and friends want to spend some time with you and your just on the camper. @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 newspaper wher the reasons why i think computers can be a good thing and a bed thing. I mostly think that computers are a good thing because if we didn't have computers we wouldnt have most of the things we now have in the world if it wasn't for computers. That's why i think computers can be more helpful just depending on the way you use it and how much you use it. Those were the opinions i had on computers."	4	4		8																					
569	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Local newspaper do you think that the computer is a good technology in our generation today? Well I do not believe it is a good technology in our generation. Do not get me wrong. I do not like to go on the computer bat their are so many reasons why computers affect alot of children and some adults in this generation. Like one reason is when people are on the computer all day long they do not get enough exercise. That is why kids these days are so over wheight there are more than @NUM1 million children over wheight because of the computer . Like for me I use to love goin on the computer and I still do bat I see that the computer is dostroying my heatlh. A second reason why I believe is bad for the generation because there are alot of inapropreate sites on the internet, where kids that are @NUM2 and younger could be logging on to. I think that people all over the world should start enjoying nature, go travle the world. Start doing things that people cant do on the computer. I think that more kids should start interesting with family and friend more often. of talking to your friend all the time. My last and finally reason that is a big thing is going on in the computer is people bullying other people the internet, local newspaper have would you if you have any daughters, sons, grand and. If they was getting bullyed over that internet or concern them to kill them or hurty them. I think you would horribly and you would want that person to go to jail. For now on I am going to think when I spend all mu time on the computer how it affect my life and my family, friends. I belive other people in the world should do the same thing."	4	4		8																					
572	1	"Dear leader of the local newspaper, I have heard the strange misconception that computers are ruining our society. I for one, think that this is a terribly made thought. To begin, the internet (provided with most home desktop computers) can teach us a lot about the world around us. Additionally, the whole fact of contacting others around the globe, as well as having a whole fun world to explore, makes computers more enjoyable. Finally, thousands of jobs around the world are either based on or work with computers. Due to this, computers are , without a doubt, beneficial to society. The first reason I need to clearly point out is that the computer holds tons of information that can't be found anywhere else. While books have to be republished as updates occur in the world, anything on the internet can be updated almost instantly, beneficial to students with school projects for subjects like @CAPS1, subsequently, people could actually go to school via online schools and colleges. Whilst regular colleges could cost around thousands of dollars in order to get in, online colleges are much rather cheap, affordable to anyone. Also, due to the high amounts of information online, schools seem to be growing obsolete as computers typically hold all information obtained in a regular school year. Because of this, computers are definately beneficial to society. To build up, the internet provided with computers can bring loads of pleasure to those who use it wisely. Because of the growing population of those who use computers, companies tend to make computer shoes, which usually attracts viewers by the thousands each day. This makes television seem obsolete as well. Another major thing is that software comes out for the computer almost everyday, allowing many things to be done by users. Software typically includes games, movies, and music. Finally, since staying in touch with others is a good thing, chatting with others across the globe is very easy and durable, allowing distant relatives to come in contact with you via various chat programs. Due to this, computers can bring loads of fun to users, and are thus beneficial to society. Lastly, due to the rising demand of computers, companies typically rely on computers for jobs. Since the internet population is growing, companies allow people to fill out applications and send in resumes in order to apply for a job in said company. Also, some jobs can only be done while online or using a computer. Many jobs these days, typically banks, rely on using the internet most of the time, and some actually are based in the internet. Because of this, workers can finish the job easily in one place, instead of having to around and going to a boring looking building to do a boring job. With this reason, why doesn't anyone else see why computers are beneficial to society? With all of these reasons, I hope you see why computers are beneficial to society. Education just become a whole lot easier thanks to the internet. If education is not what you seek, you can then use the internet to have fun when you are bored. Finally, jobs can be completed even easier, and makes workers more responsible. So, leader of the paper, do you really, along with everyone else, think that computers are a waste of time in life?"	6	5		11																					
583	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I agree with the experts in people staying on the computer to much. The reason why is family and friends are distant, mood swings can occur and also being overweight, finally computers can do a lot of things @CAPS1 far. To be on the computer too much, your family will start to worry about you. If you were to stay on a computer for a whole day, taht causes people to think otherwise of how you are. Also if you were to stay inside on a @DATE1 and your friends come over but you say, ""I don't wanna go out"", there just drifting away slowly. Since I am a teen I stay up texting and talking and going outside and I hate to see on of my friend's on the computer when I wanna hang out. When I was @NUM1 or @NUM2, I used to always be on the computer for like days to weeks, until my friend's and family said don't let this get to you. I had a friend who was a good athlete and very funny and nice, but when his mom got him a computer, I didn't want to be his friend. When I was @NUM2 I use to get mad at everything if I couldn't use the computer, it was like I was a brat. Also I used to be big, (as in overweight) because I never went outside to exercise or in my own room. The reason being on why I stopped being his friend was he to get mad if I come over there to ask if he can come outside. Also when he did come outside he used to never do nothing or run because he was always @CAPS1 tired, @CAPS1 what I am trying to say is the computer can really change people in a lot of bad way's. The last thing which makes everyone change is what computer's can do now. For example, a game called @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 can get you addicted @CAPS1 fast, you barely do anything elese. Another bad thing is @CAPS4, sure you keep in touch with friends but if you stay on too long, it's basically hooked you into it. Lastly online chatting room's or games when you can create a person to look like you makes you think that's gonna be your life from now on. Also people think that computer's can do anything it really can't, everything a computer can do is like a drug it's addicting. Well I just gave you a little thing of a lot of thing's a computer can do but to refresh your memory I'll say it again. A reason why I agree is family and friends seem distant to you at times you get mood swing's and less exercising, lastly what a computer could do now. Since you know now of the danger's that can happen I suggest you rethink about computers."	4	5		9																					
586	1	"Dear newspaper editor, In my opion computers have a positive effect on people. The @CAPS1 allows people to communicat. People can learn bout things, places, even their own family. I also think that with a appropiate dosage it could help your body. If the @CAPS1 was never invented how would you talk to people from around the world. Mr. editor what if you were fourteen and had no friends. Well you could always go on myspace.com, facebook.com, or any other online community and make friends. Another thing that could happen is a family member or friend goes to another country for a vacaition and can't have long distance calls, you can talk to them on @CAPS2 or something like that. If your not really into using the @CAPS1 for communication you could learn. With the @CAPS1 you could learn a lot. You can even go to school online, but as I was saying you can learn about anything. One time when I had a project at school on fredrick douglas I used the @CAPS1 for help. I learned bout his family, his childhood, were he's from, and lots of other important facts. The @CAPS1 can be a good search enging but don't stay for to long your body needs you too. I think think the @CAPS1 better can your health. People always say if stay on the computer you get fat and unhealthy, but I don't think that. First being on a computer using the mouse is helping your hand-eye coordination. you can also look at diet plans, find medicine for your health, or find new ways to exercise your body. So thats why I think the @CAPS1 can help your body. All of these reason is why I think the @CAPS1 has good effects on people."	4	4		8																					
589	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that going on the computer has a positive effect on people. It is also true that some people are not getting enough exercise. To prevent not getting enough exercise we should play sports or have family activities to atleast get out of our house. Everybody needs to stop being lazy and get active. I think that an excerise day should be mode and turned into a tradition. It could be twice a year or more a month or whatever is picked as long as there is one day @LOCATION2 or even more than @LOCATION2 can exercise on."	2	3		5																					
594	1	"Dear local newspaper, I think spending to much time on a computer is bad. One of my reasons are Exercising. People should be outside jogging or working out and enjoying nature. Also should be socializing with friend. Now my second reason is spending time with your fromily. Being with your family is important because their fun go out with. Also they're good to socialize with at home or any other place. Sometimes socializing with people on a computer is not good as if with people because socialicing with friends and family is easier than sitting on a chair typing a bunch of works explaining about the convosation your having. And last my finall reason is being active. People should be active because it's fun and your socialicing with people and playing sports with or . It keeps you and healthy. Also being active can healthen your lungs and heart. For example football keeps your legs strong and built. And basketball keeps you quick and always running. It's good for you because being active gives you a healthier, stronger and in shape body. So their for I think spending a lot of time on a computer is bad."	3	4		7																					
598	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you ever just wanna go out side and play a game of football with the ones you love? Well I know I @CAPS2. I believe that almost @PERCENT1 of kid are on the computer @NUM1 because they have nothing to @CAPS2 or it is addicting. The reson that I belive in this strongly true stament. That people are consurnet about how much time people spend on the computer and not with ther familys. One important fact about kid being on the comuter is how dangours it can be. Now a days kids don't relize how dangours being online can be for example I rember a time when my cousin said that he went to the movies to meat up with some girl he meat on myspace but all he saw was a, balet hewdet, sex ofender. That told him he was the one talking to him online. That he wanted my cousin to go over his house and play x-box and my cousin screamed hell no and leaft to my house cause the movie theater wher closer to my house. Know being safe is important. Would you rater have your children safe with you or with some stranger? Computer can also be helpful at time when needed for school or you job. Only people would think its fun to home and go on the computer for no reason. Second of an dont you want to spend time with children before they go to college or some thing? Just the littlest thing like playing a game of football will affect them to create a better with you and you chiled. Some thing you can @CAPS2 to get them to go out side with you is take the computer away for a week and have fun with your child. Play some of his/her favorite sports. So with the computer computer. without a bond with you and you chiled. So the time has come to make a let your kid be lazy on the computer and get into or go have fun with them?"	4	4		8																					
604	1	"@ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 are many reasons why the computer technoligy benefits the society. For starters, the newspaper companies use computers to write the @ORGANIZATION2 paper. Personally, I believe that computers benefit the society for many reasons. Computers help with education, career building, and helps people connect with family. By readin this letter, I hope that this make computers appealing to you. One reason why people benefit from computers is how they help with education. In a poll taken at @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of the students say that computers hel htem with their academic career. Also, many adults use computers for an education too. In the student body in class of '@NUM1 at @CAPS2 high school, most of the students quit school before they could finish senior year. @PERCENT2 of those students finished their high school and college years through online classes. Another reason how computers benefit the society is by helping with careers. At @CAPS3 industries, @PERSON1, the @CAPS4, says, " I dont know where our business would be if we didn't use computers. " @CAPS5 to a poll taken by @CAPS4's of many high ranning industries, @PERCENT3 said that their business revolves around the internet. this could very well be the poll your @CAPS4 took. Finally, computers help families that are seperated, connect with each other. A marine said that he tries to contact his family as much as he can while he is at sea. If anyone deserves to contact their family that they haven't seen in two years, it should deffinately be the people in the army. In conclusion, the computer technoligy has benefited many people. A system that could regulate peoples computer use could be implamented but it would not make anybody happy. The changes could be made but, if anyone tried to take something important away, would you not do anything to stop it?"	5	4		9																					
609	1	"Dear Newspaper, I think Computers are a good effect in our lives. Some of the reasons why I say this is the good to use when researching has fun games and activities, and they keep you in touch with long distant reletives. First if you just been given a assignment for school or work you @MONTH1 have to type and research on what ever topic a computer is a great source of knowledge if researching something or even checking your bills, @CAPS1, Computers are fun they have lots of games and activities for you to play and do. Just think you sitting in the house on a rainy day bored out you mind and have no thing to do. Just go on your computer and play some game or just find some activities you whole family could do. Lastly, Computers are good to stay in contact with long distant family members these days all you have to do is get a web cam and hours it up to your computer and now its they our grandma, grandpa, cousin, and uncle, or who ever is right there you can talk to them like you were on the phone with no cost. In conclusion, as you can see after all I wrote computers, are good for researching, playing games or doing activities, and staying in touch with family I @CAPS2 in my house the computer is mostly used for the web cam to see my grandma in @LOCATION1. Well I hope this letter changed you oppinion on this great invention, the computer."	4	3		7																					
612	1	"In our socity computers have a big role. Some people think that this inhaces our socity and benefits the people in the @LOCATION1. Other people think computers are hurting the @CAPS1 citizens. I belive that computers can have our socity into the next and can inhance use to people. Comptores can benifit people by tracking hand-eye coordination give people the ability to learn about the world, and allow people to communicate to others. Computers can teach hand-eye coordination which helps people work with their hands. An arument on the of this is that computers take the place of exercise. For a lot of @CAPS2 a sport is their exercise and in every sport you need hand-eye coordination. Computers don't take the place of they inhance the persons ability to play for exsample to be a goaly in any sport you need fast mentions and good hand-eye coordination. A computer can help the save more goals by increasing their hand-eye coordination. Having good hand-eye coordination can also save you life. If a knife was you human nature world tell you to cover your head with your hands. This would you, if you had hand-eye coordination you away with your body to avoid the knife. Computers help you physically but they can help you mentally as well. Computers can take you around the world without leaving your room. Computers can teach go about culture and life that you didn't even know excisted. The cahan @CAPS1 can not aford the luexury of seeing the world first hand, computers let those people see the world from difient points of veiw. If a student needed to know all about one country they could go on the enternet and get a tour. A student could not go to the country so they went to the second base thing the computer. They can the wanted with one click. Family, friend and coligees are all people you need to talk to. Computers made communication easy for anyone. Now you can talk and see a person in video chat. This benifits socity because if you are talking to a buissness partner you can point to graphs and charts you made. You can also to see a love one that you miss. Their is a different type of comunication for every person. You can e-mail, @CAPS4, instant message, etc. Comunication connects people around the world it a small world after all. Computers have taken our socity in the next level. People can travel the world in a second, talk to anyone and have hand-eye coordination. Computers are growing @LOCATION2 keeping is on top. What would you choose?"	5	5		10																					
618	1	"Dear @CAPS1: People are spending far to much time on computers. This go for children and adults alike. Just think about it anything you can do on a computer you can do without a computer. That and pepole need to spend mor time outside expiriencing nature. Lastly some bad things can be shown and can happen while online. I chalenge you to name one thing you can do on the computer that you can't do without. You can't even name one. Think about it you can reserch and find pictures from books and magasigns. Insted of social networking sites you can actualy go and see the person or if they are far away you can call them or write them a letter. To find out about current events you can read the newspaper or watch the news. If you like using computer disign programs try drawing a real picture instead. Lastly if you download a lot of music you can just but a cd or better yet go to see the band live. Face it you can't do ehything on a computer that actualy requires the computer. Artificial simulations are no mach for the real outdoors. On a computer all you can do is watch and even that is nothing compared to the real thing it's just a snapshot of it. Outside you can the gentel breses the warm sun the cool grass, you can smell fresh pine and clean air. You can hear all the other cretures surounding you. Going outside is better for you to. Outside you get exersize and vitimin @CAPS2 while inside you get fat lazy and sick. Can't you see how great the outdoors are? Computers can do more harm than good. They can show children inapropriat pictures and talk about inapropriat topics. They are even now using computers to sell illegal drugs. Children allso often use the internet irrisponsibly and to things that can dissrupt frendships and get them into truble. The computer has also made it alot easyer for kidnappers to find children and kidnapp them. They do this by pretending to be the childs peer then using the information the child him he will make almost a garunteed kidnapping. This is happening more and more frequently. The computer isn't as helpful as you thought. Computers are not realy benificial to our socity. They have no rel use that isn't alredy taken care of. The can not replace the real outdoors. Lastly they can be eisily used for bad even ilegal purpuses. As you can see computers should be used as much as they are being used by the general public."	4	4		8																					
620	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 you think computer have a positive or negative affect on people? I think it has a Positive affect. There are a few reasons for this. First, computers are used for education around the world. Second, it helps us connect with and meet new friends. Lastly, You can use a computer for world news. As you can see, those are just a few reasons. First, Computers are used for education around the world. For example some people use it to go to college online. Others use it to find information on things like egypt, where we cant go. Second, it helps us connect with, and meet new friend. We can chat with our friends, which is very useful. If we need to know what a homework assignment was we can just chat with a friend. Lastly, You can use computer to find out about world news. We can go and find out if something serious happened, like the earthquake in haiti. As you can see, those are just a few reasons I think that computers have a positive affect on us. I hope you agree with me. "	3	4		7																					
624	1	"There are many great things about computers. If we were to loose them then our lives would change dramatily. You can use computers for exercise then it is also up to the @CAPS3 on limits. Last it can save lives Computers are great, if we were to loose them. There would be no more internet. you would't be able to talk to friends on @CAPS1 or e-mail. Cell phone prices would go through the roof. We would technacly be going back @NUM1 to @NUM2 years. Last with out computers there would be more diffeculty in large companies Computers can help exercise. One way is we can find closest gyms on the internet. We can find what is healthy to eat right away You can also get one of those @CAPS2 fits for a computer. Also you can find free work out videos. Next, it should be up to the @CAPS3. It is their discretion if they see that the child is spending to much time on the comuter and gaining weight they can easaly limit it. they can say for very hour your on the computer you have to do an hour of exercise. Lastly the computer can save lives. Before computers medicine like tylonal was used for everything. Stuffy nose, headache, cold etc. Now we can go on the computer to find weather the medication is at all dangerous. You can also find the nearest hospital. Finally, computers can do a lot of good, even though it can make less unhealthy if you spend to much time on it it can save your life. It can also destroy companies and our lives, @CAPS3 can give limits and computers can used to exercise. So reading this essay please don't take away our computer"	4	4		8																					
627	1	"Dear local newspaper @CAPS1, I do agree that exercising,. I think that people exercising more, and spend time with family and friends. The issue to with is should more people sometime on their less time, exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends should it be the other way around. The first reason why I think that people should spend more time exercising than on their computers is because I think that more to watch and watch the way they eat and keep that self fit because what responsible to see their kid eat and then out exercising and then then self. My second reason is I think that people should time enjoying nature then computer The reason I think this id because they would never would never know what going on computer. How can you never things do. My third reason is interacting with friends and family I think that people should friends and family then on the computer because interacting with friends and family you learn things that you never knew about then and you can places you never gonna be sure discover new things you never your life. For example over vacation I did things and things about my family and friends than I never know why because I people interacting I learned how fun they really are and intering and happy. Have fun where is the computer. Please don't your life live your life. It's now or never should 'people spend more time on or more time exercising. interacting with family and friends."	4	4		8

From riding horses to riding extraordinary fast sports cars and hwlet trains. The advances in technology have proven the sky have the limit the invention of planes. We have even reached the moon and left our ! Computers have only become faster and. Although more and more people are using one of our greatest technological advances, computers, believe it doesnt benefit socialy. I veherrertly believe that computers benefit. They have the ability in and teach us what seems like information, second, they have made the could a smaller place through communication. Last, they even have the ability to locate missing people. Computers are constanly helping society. They follow what technology to make life @CAPS3. First of all, computers are a benefit to society because they have the ability to and teach teach us what seems like infinite information.

Finally, computers benefit society have the ability to locate missing people. The record earthquale in @LOCATION3. cries of mothers children whom they from. It is to computers that these families were scuniled. On many sites on the internet, @LOCATION3 set up person locators. These locators allowed you to write down your name disaster should over happen. Not only this you family. All they had to do me! Computers have even made our society. What move could. In conclusion, I strongly believe that computers society is because computers contain much informations and programs they have proven the earth is a ""small world after all"" and they have made the world safer.

630	1	"Dear Newspaper, i am writing you this letter, about computers, in the hope that you will publish it. Over @NUM1 the people in @LOCATION1 has a computer, but are they really healthy? I don't believe computers are a good thing. People spend to much time on them & less time excirsing, enjoying nature & most of all, it's highly dangerous. I don't believe computers are a good thing because people don't excersise like they did. Some people spend @NUM2 out of @NUM3 hours in a daw on computers for others it's there whole life. People spend so much time on computers they lose touch with the outside world. Ever since computers came out, obestity has gone up. all people do is chat to other people & think ""they don't have to know what I look like.""They sit at the computer eating & eating. That's not healthy. I dont think computers are good also because they spend less time enjoying nature. It used to be when I had somoe free time, I could call up a friend & ask them to take a walk with me somewhere & they'd say ""sure! Now they say ""@CAPS1 get on the computers & we can take a virtual walk."" That's not the same as an actual walk with the wind in your face the fresh smell, & all the animals, at least not to be. Nature is a thing of beauty & if you don't enjoy appreciate it, it'll turn into something hideous. Nature used to be the most peaceful think now it the internet. I dont think computers are good because most importantly they're dangerous. Little kids, like myself, think they're grown up & go on computers & meet rapist, murderer, thiefs, all kids of criminals. Also people send hurtful & violent things to each otehr & it yo're on the computer alot of bad people can track you down. Also, the military & @ORGANIZATION1 keeps secrets on computers but if your smart enough you can hack it. Computers aren't safe for anyone or anything.

Computer can help you earn in many ways one way you could learn from computers is students can go online and got information for their school projects by finding this information it can help the students get better grades. Also the students can use the computer as a way to study. There are educational games on the computer that kids play and without knowing this they are learning and studying for school. Another way you could too a is from online classes. This could help people also because do not have enough many to pay to go to classes. As you can see there are many ways to learn from having computer. The computer can also help you talk to people from out of the state or country. This could help famlies stay connected when they live so far away from you. My cousin @PERSON4 and my aunt @CAPS1 math live in @LOCATION1 and i hadn't met then until the @DATE1, when they came down. @CAPS3 that i have met them i am able to stay them through the computer.

636	1	"Dear local newspaper, I feel that computers are very useful to society. For example, millions of people and companies and small buisnesses require the use of computers in order to optimally run their buisness. Everyone who uses computers on a daily basis can confirm that they are very useful. In fact, computers are so useful, some schools are starting to notice. I hightly reccomend that you get aquanted with such a useful and very recognized plece of technology. Did you know that many billion-dollar companies and small buisnesses require the uses that a computer has to offer? For example, my mother is s former-district manager of the fast-food company, @ORGANIZATION1. When she worked at the company, they gave her a laptop that she could use only for her work. This proves my point that companies and small buisnesses require the features of a computer to smoothly run the buisness of which they run or one employed at. The technology of computers has brought education to new. Some teachers (including my own, @PERSON1) have taken the initiative to incorporate the modern technology of computers into their teachings. Classes have even been created in schools because of the popularity of computers. For example, at my school, a computer education (or, comp, for short) class has been created for kids to understand the knowledge and skills using a computer can give to them in the real-world. In my opinion, I it is great that computers are incorporated in so many places. Computers are used by millions of people every day. Such buisnesses are corporate like @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 are starting to see the brilliance in using computers in their company. In fact, computers are so useful and helpful, teachers have taken up using computers in their classrooms.

640	1	"Dear, I strongly believe that computers are great. There are a-lot of great things you can do on the computers. A-lot of people are saying that computers have bad effects on people, like not getting enough exercise and spending time with your family. I do not agree with that because say you have family in a different town, city, or state. There is a website where you can webcam people from all over world with anybody, so that is a good opportunity and also it is free and you can do it at anytime and if you have a laptop, anywhere! My next reason is that you get to see places you have never seen before with direct pictures, like on commercials when our familly wants to go on vaction to a far place and you know nothing about it. You can go on the computer and look up the place and see what it is about and also see what other people said about. Like if it is really hot, or cold, is it a good experience for kids, anything you want, the computer has it. My last reason on why computers are good is because of studying, one thing that always happens is I leave my textbook home. I can go on the computer and see what we had to do. Also you can use the computer to study and learn easier ways to do something for any subject. Survey’s shows that @PERCENT1 of the kids who study on the computer pass there test and get a higher grade percentage +@NUM1. Also if a kid is studying and dosent know what a word is they can I look it up and figure out the definition and how to use it in a sentence. That is why I think computers are a great exercise for your well being and personality."	4	3		7

Their job. Please listen to my reason why the computer effect people lives! My first reason their they don't know what happening out ide because they are to much busy on the computer. Their friends could of won something important and they wanted you to be their but no they are just so busy on the computer. They are going to miss out of nature or hanging out with friends. Like if they are meeting one at a place and they said they if just means they were on the computer all day long. My second reason is theie family. I said their family because they could miss out on a lot of things. Such as a family reunion, a family vacation and many more. It like if one of their family members hurt and they are trying to call you but you dont picking up the phone because you to busy on the computer to pick it up. You can lose your wife cause the computer because you forgot her birthday, her and her because you are on the stupid computer. About their kids, what happens if they want to playing they have nothing also to do card their? Say no cause you computer. They family will get rewing. My third and last reason is their job. They can lose their job cause your missed work cause your on the computer for doing nothing work cause computer. If they lose their jobs they can pay for they can't use their computer. They are going to be in their house with no light and no computer cause they have on it to much and did not pay attention was happening. They akk to feel like they are going to cause they dont have their computer. Or the computer shot doen and he cant enough money to get a electriction.

Yesterday, I went to my local library and found @NUM1 computers in the library. All of the computers were filled with people and, a line with @NUM2 people ready to go on next. I ask those @NUM2 people "why were they there?" "for homework" said a teenager. Another, "just to come and paly". I also ask, "how do they stay fit?" "I don't like @CAPS1 fit" said beautiful lady. "@CAPS1 fit isn't esay if your always on the computer" said the teenager. The response I got from those people, were unbelievable. If we don't stay fit how are we going to survivie from all these dieases and cancer. This reason has pently to do witj not @CAPS1 fit. I don't know about you but I care about my family, I would never spend the rest of my life infront of a computer instead of my love ones. In the of , I was surprise to find out that projects, homework and research can take up half of your time, with your family. Do the computer, you can find some resort for you and your friends and fanily, you can't be doing for more than minutes. The great out doors should be one of the best places to be. because it quit, its amazing and its a large area. If you looking up the out doors on a computer, now thats a of time, that you could have been with a family member in the or where ever. My father says its great to buit its to live it. The days are getting shorter lets live it like."	4	4		8

Computers keep people intouch, all over the world. Computers also come in handy when something needs to be looked up right away. Computers are very helpful when it comes to learning. They can teach you things that most books cant, such as hand eye coordination also about the current populations of countrys and cities. Also, computers gives you the opportunity to see pictures of places and people that you couldn't find in books or photo albums or newspapers. They also help in schools when projects are asigned. Kids can use computers to find information they need quickly. Kids can also use computer to wright essays or print pictures for projects. Computers are definately a staple for learning & education. Computers are also great for comunication. People can chat with one another on networking sites such as @CAPS1, facebook, myspace, and twitter. On these sites people can send messages to their friends a leaking them of something or chat with their friends to see whats to keep in touch with family and friends, on the computer. Family members can e-mail each other to inform them of an event or news. I have actually had an experience with e-mail that was very helpful my family members and I had been speaking of traveling to block island and two days before we were going to leave we recived on email from the owner of the house we were going to stay at stating that all phone lines were down and part of the house was ruined due to a storm. If it werent for computers we would have been in a sick situation. Computers also come in handy in times of need or confusion. People can check their local weather forecasts to see of the weather will effect their plans. Also if someone doesn't know where a house or store is located they cab quickly look it up on the computer. Finaly if something is unavailable on a store people can shop for it online and can buy what they need, and have it shaped to their door step. Computers have helped this country grow and prosper. Why bother to go aginst them when they benafit society so much? Computers are helping the world become a better educated, connected, and informed world."	5	5		10																					
660	1	"The topic that is on many minds in our country is, ""Are computers beneficial, or harmful to our students?"" @CAPS1 have evolved from dosktop computers, and before that, type writers, but have they gone too far? While the blank screen of a computer @MONTH1 distract some, the benefits defin out weigh the bads in a situation like this. Being able to have faster research, easier communicating and computers in wartime are great capabilitys of the modern computer. Also, due to advancement in technology, computers are very helpful because they help @LOCATION4 with our daily lifes. Many doubts about the computer exist, but the computer can surpass all of them. In a time crunch situation like college or high school, speed is everything. Computers allow students to research faster, and with more accuracy by being able to search for key words. Before, students would have to do the painstaking process of searching in books. More times than not, they wouldn't find what they were looking for, but with the modern age, students can get the information they need fast. Also, having computers in the classroom helps so that teachers can get the info they need for an upcoming class. If speed is what you need, then you will look for a computer. Besides speed, computers also give you another great thing, communication. With emails, @CAPS2's, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and blogs, knowing what your friends are doing later is just a click away! This is much easier than calling the person. Also having this access to friends can help when one moves away. If you miss a long lost friend or cousin, just search their name, and you can talk to them! Having friends so close by you can really make every life great. Out in @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION1, solgiers rely on computers for valueable information; such as radar, or robots. Having computers do the ""dirty work"" can help in times of war, and can save valuable lives. Not having these computers would mean certain death for some people in the @LOCATION4 armed forces. Computers some times take the place of humans in things such as @ORGANIZATION1's, or unmaned airieal vehical and some many lifes too. Weather it be facebook or bombings, computers help in a vital way. It was @DATE1 and @PERSON1's communist regime was ruling new @LOCATION2. One man stood in front of a tank, resisting to move, showing courage and wanting a democracy. Fortuneatly, this was all caught on film. How was it broadcasted to the world? Using the computer, and internet. Today many people are able to learn about that due to computers. In many ways computers help @LOCATION4 with our daily lives and for most of @LOCATION4, without them, we would be lost."	6	5		11																					
669	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter to inform you about the Use of computers. Computers can be fun and interesting, But, people are spending to much time on the computer. @CAPS3 opinion is you should spend time interacting with people in your society, your family, and friends. I also think that @CAPS2 is easy to get addicted to the computer, I should @CAPS1 I was a person that spent @CAPS3 time @NUM1 on the computer and @CAPS2 wasn't good. You should be safe on the computer because now and days @CAPS2's dangerous @CAPS2 is appalling that people spend More time on the computer than with ther own Family. Don't you agree? Well you shoud, your society, family, and friend should be the most important thing to you. You shouldn't be spending your whole day on the computer, you should be interacting with the people around you. Now and days you will see plenty of people on the computer and not spending time with there family. That shouldn't be going on. Although the computer is fun and interesting you will have people around you the wisher to spend time with you. You should think about this because this is happening to much in the world. @PERCENT1 of the people in @CAPS3 school say their addicted to the computer, and @PERCENT2 of the people in @CAPS3 community say their addicted to the computer too. Those are very high numbers don't you think? This is terrible and should stop going on. The computer is like a drug, you can get on the computer one time, then your just going to want to stay on ti everyday all day. The first time you get on the computer you will be addicted to @CAPS2 right away. I'm not saying you should never get on the computer, but be sure you won't get too addicted to @CAPS2 because @CAPS2 can happen very easily. @CAPS3 mother always sayed "be safe on the computer". At first I didn't really @CAPS1 what she meant, but now I @CAPS1. What ever you do on the computer will stay their and be saved no matter how you try to delete @CAPS2. So, you should be safe and don't put any thing on the computer if you would want anyone else to see @CAPS2. Anyone can see what you put so you should be safe. Kids are meeting people they don't @CAPS1 and try to meet them. So you should watch out because the computer is the only place @CAPS7 you can lie. Now you should understand @CAPS7 im coming from. You should now agree with me and under stand that people should spend more time you don't get addicted and be safe."	4	4		8																					
671	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I felt shoeked to see that there are people that beileve that computers don't benefit society and after hearing that I felt compelled to share my opinions. They help socitey. They help us communicate, do important thing have fun. Computers help us communicate in many ways. We all want to talk to our freinds, but we can not be with our freidns all the time, so there is she internet to help us. We also all have freinds we don't see very often, but we still want to talk to them so with is intenet we can talk to them as long as we went. Computers also help us make new freinds. They can also ehlpo us have fun. Computers are fun for many different reasons. Social networking sites, like facebook or myspace, are fun to be on. There are many fun things to do or the internet including video games, many video games consoles are attatched to the intenet so you can play with your freinds. But computers arent just all fun and games. Computers can transfer very important information including homework after schol activities. Computers also hold all of our governments information, from thingsas insignificant as plans for renovation on a town owned building to the department homeland security to the united states of without computers none of that would be possible. This should have conclude you that computers nessesary in our every day from communication, to very things computers have helped us and will to help us in the future."	4	4		8																					
684	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that there is an ongoing debate about the issue stating that not everyone agrees that computers benefit society. I can't understand why. Computers present many oppurtunities for people. They allow for people to communicate with each other, they allow people to research topics in a simpler way, and they teach hand-eye coordination. This is why I agree that computers do benefit society. In the modern world, nearly all businesses rely on communication. Many people in those businesses use not only phones to communicate, but computers as well. Online communication is a fast, simple, and effective way for people to communicate whether @CAPS1 is at home or at work. This is one way computers benefit all of society. Nobody knows everything, we are always trying to find out about new things that we neven knew. Sometimes we @MONTH1 use books, but the way most people use is online researching. This is because not only is @CAPS1 quicker, but simpler as well. When you research online, the information literally comes to you. All you do is type a subject to @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is another reason why computers do benefit society. The final reason is that computers teach hand-eye coordination. This shows because as time progresses while you are on the computer you realize that typing becomes easier. @CAPS1 might take a while, but over time people get the hang. @CAPS1's as @CAPS1 the computer is letting you teach yourself. Some people would say that people spend too much time on computers. This isn't a problem though because people have to spend long periods of time on computers in order to do the beneficial things that computers have to offer. In conclusion, you can see that I have clearly stated the benefits of computers. They allow us to communicate, research, and improve our hand-eye coordination. This is why computers do benefit society."	4	4		8																					
690	1	"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I believe that computers do benefit society. People are able to read, shop, and play online. This makes life easier for many people. Buying books that you would like to read can get expensive. With the internet, people are able to read almost any book right on their computer. In a recent survey, it was found that people who read books online save an additional @MONEY1 a year more than people who buy books. People can also read things like newspaper online. If there is snow on the ground, and people are unable to get their newspaper, they can read it online. This way they will know if a newspaper is still good, and continue buying it, including the @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. Additionally, people are able to shop online. Sometime, someone @MONTH1 have been an accident injuring them, and they are stuck at home. If it is a child, their parents will be unable to go to the store because they will be caring for the child. They can simply go on the computer and have food and other necessities delivered to them. People can also do this if they have a busy lifestyle with work or school. @PERSON1, a physician, told me that people who shop online have @PERCENT1 less stress than people who go to the store for the same items. He said that is is because they do not need to worry about taking much time out of their schedule to shop. Moreover, the computer is a good way to quictly play games. Young children can be very loud and energetic. Parents can just let them play games and read on the computer. Little kids love just the fact of being on the computer, and letting them go on can keep quiet and occupied for a while. Even just typing is interesting for younger kids. For older kids, there are many games that can play. Action, strategy, puzzles, and many more. They can also play against people around the world. The computer is fun for everyone. So in conclusion the computer is a very good place to go shopping, read books, and play games. Computers greatly help families of today."	5	4		9																					
692	1	"I don't think that computers is the most positive effect. Because most computer's are not like that the computers are not the smartest but it does help you when you need to do something like a project when you have to look for pictures and when you need help with math you can use the calculator on the computer but the computer does not help you on all your subject's the computer only help's you on a couple of your subject's that is the main reason I use the computer. Sometimes when I'm doing homework I let the computer do it for me so it is eaiser for me to do and I look for website's on it they give you really good website's that is why mostly everyone use's the computer they mostly use the comptuer to look for job's, car's, or a house that is what they mainly use the computer for most people do not like useing the internet because they think it's cheating to use the computer."	3	3		6																					
693	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, In ones opinion about computers and what they can do to benefit society these days. Ones opinion about what the effects that computers have or people are that they can benefit us in many ways for example they can communicate with people around the world for example many people @MONTH1 have friends or family that live in another state or country computers can help us communicate with them. Commputers alow us to help us learn what we couldn't learn from books. Computers can help us with learning such as learning about or the population. One might think that is good but its slow with computers you can send emails and have the person on the other end reply instantly because of computers. Computers have benefited society in many ways. Computers in ones opinion about them is that they can benefit us in many ways we wouldn't think of being possible. Before computers and printers we had in use type writers and if you messed up you would have start again and it could take hours or work to get the paper perfect but with the worlds modern we would don't have to type whole paragraph over again if we make a mistake we can just hit the back space button on the keyboard so it won't take us hours to type one page or when it take half an how at most so computers have benefited us in more way than we know it. So in ones opinion about computers and what they can do to benefit us is that they allow us to do things we couldn't have done before the computer was invented. The computer was a great invention and it is benefited mankind as we speak and that it is that hard to set up. So in ones opinion about computers and what they do that can benefit the society that we live in and also benefit mankind as well."	4	4		8																					
698	1	"Dear who it @MONTH1 concern, I think that computers are very affective but then again they are not because would you rather have your kids on the computer or lets say some children smoke and some hang out in the streets to much yeah it does do a lot affect to them. In my predictionI say computers are very addictive but then again it really isn't because there are some people who really don't like being on the computers for a long time cause it gets boring and it starts to hurt you eyes. I will understand if they don't want to get off when it passes there bed time. Some kids do a lot of bad things out in the street and hang out in the streets a lot, but when they go on the computer it can stop some of them from doing those things. A lot of kids have myspace and facebook ... and more and it is the best way to stay in contact with your family and friends thats one of the main reasons kids go on and there is other electronic devices that stops kid from exersicing and stuff like that such as a psp go or xbox @NUM1 or ds, dsi playstation @NUM2 and @NUM3. So I think it is an addiction and it affects kids but the things you'd rather have your kids do keeps them away from doing it."	3	3		6																					
699	1	"Dear @CAPS1 Society: Computers are perhaps one of the greatest improvements to our societies advancement in knowledge in the past few decades. These gems of future, are like a human being; they have their own mind and can figure out answers to all problems. People all around the world use them, from @LOCATION5 to @LOCATION4, to @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1, they are being used. People from ages of school kids, to adults who have a job so highly appreciated as a chemist, use computers! Do you wish to be that one standing on the side lines, stuck in the past, not advancing with technology? From the creations of rockets, engines and planes; computers have never let us down. Still, the question is this: will computerized technology benefit our society or crash it down? Ever since the @DATE1, computers have been used as an ad for new information. The speed that they are able to recieve new information in is just astonishing! @CAPS2 @PERSON2, computer engenieer, says ""With the technology that we recieve from computers, we are able to be in the game."" @CAPS2 just comes to show one of the best benefits of computers: their ability to display the most current information. Now, I can see how books are an excellent resource in society, and how they provide for amazing information, however it takes years to publish books! With the use of a computer, information that occured sometimes as close to @NUM1 hours ago can appear on the internet! Not only will this allow you to get information faster, but it will allow our society to ""be in the game."" You catch a football as it soars through the air, you track a baseball or it flys high in the sky, you grasp the face of a basketball all because you have ""hand-eye"" coordination. Hand-eye coordination is perhaps one of the most neccessarry aspects of life that a person can have. Face it, everybody needs it! So why not help your body to get that talent: buy a computer. Imagine, our society would advance in it's sports and even just with life if they learn how to coordinate themselves. Did you know that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people who owned a computer and typed daily were able to catch all three tennis-balls that were thrown at them! You could do that too! When typing on a computer, human development observers states, your eyes a free tracked on the screen and you train your hands to manuvor about the keys all by themselves. Just as in basketball, when you train your hand to track the bounce of the ball without you needing the need to catch it. I can remember when I started typing, my hands began to naturally find the keys without me having to look at them. And the next day at basketball practice I felt like @CAPS3 amazing point-guard @PERSON1, the ball just came straight to my hand! Get this need of life, invest in a computer! Money @MONTH1 be the most vital thing in our society right now. With profits as low as medium wage, our local area is not that ""rich."" I can see how it could be hard, having to purchase these computers at prices as high as @MONEY1 each. But then just think, each book that we won't have to purchase would save us @NUM4 each. Not only do computer's stand to last @NUM5 longer than any paperback, their information is always new, changing, and up-to-date. In order for us to be purchasing new books because of recent information would end up coasting as more in the long-run. Our neighboring society of @LOCATION3 just invested in over @NUM6 comptuers for their society. The stated that it took onlyt @NUM7 months to get the money back that they had purchased on the computer's with the amount that had not purchasing book! Now just imagine how much money our society would gain after @NUM8 year! It is necessary for our society to have computers. With them we not only learn hand-eye coordination but we invest in more money for the. And now with so many things happening in the world it is important to recieve information instantely from these computers. I can't stress enough that without them we just @MONTH1 be less in the rest. Dreams of incrediable rockets and medicines and cures far diseases just won't happen. Computers rise perhaps the only thing that actually benefits our society. You must understand how important this technology is to our society! But, int the long-run, the decision is yours is make. Choose quickly, the fate of our society is in your hands."	6	6		12

Say that you have to look something up for school and you can't get to the liebery, but you have a computer at your house. You can use it to find info. You can use the computer to learn how to do something like making somthing and a lot more. You can use the computer after school if you cann't go out and hang with your friends.

Communication with people around the world is a huge advantage. Computers keep kids and teens entertained. There are games on websites. Computers are the thing we use today. A lot of things are done by computers, computers also prevent you from wasting money on books because you could just google it. There are a lot of disadvantages to computers. They cost a lot of money. Computers can down. There could also be dumb websites that have no purpose like facebook and myspace. Computers are complicated if you don't grow up with them it's hard to learn. The government has all they're information in computers. If they didn't people would be able to steal information a lot.

718	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A regular day for a person, with a computer, includes at least three hours using the computer per day. Today, people, especially teens, spend their precious hours wasting time on sites like facebook, myspace @CAPS1 and more! Just think about it, just sitting in a chair with your eyes gluded to the computer when you could be exercising, spending time with family and friends or enjoying nature? After all do we really need a computer? Obesity is one of the highest concerns in the country today. However, we can prevent it! We are certainly not helping this issue when we have childre. Adults sitting in a chair for a large part of their day doing absolutley nothing! We are so fortonate, our town has at least two physical fitness buildings for anyone can attend instead of using the computer. ANd even if you can't attend a gym you could easily walk around your neighborhood. There are running program held at our local beach, @LOCATION1, where you can exercise or even run a small competition! Please exercising is key to everybody's health and there are numerous ways to exercise, but using the computer is not one of them! Teachers, parents, children writers everyone lets stay away from the computers and stay fit! Family and friends are those who make us truly hapy but if we on the computer how are we going to see them? More and more people are making less effort to see people in person. Instead many people video chat through cameras on the computer. We need to change this habit. Everybody needs to socialize face to face. If we socialize through computers our socializing skills could worsen because you are not practicing the socializing skills like eye contatct. Instead of talking to people online we could be enjoying with those same people at an amusment park, a restaurant, at a park or simply in our barkyard/house. The world is so beautiful with so many places to see but society is too busy to see it because we're on computer for a long time. Our computers use up so much energy and is a threat to the world, @CAPS2 @CAPS3! Instaed of entertaining ourselves on computer we could be taking hikes, walks on the beach even our street or playing outside in our yard.

720	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to you about the use of computers and how they are bad for society. With people getting less exercise, not enjoying nature, and having less interactions they are doing the world more bad than good. Almost everyone has a computer and it gets used more and more and it is just taking away a great time to go be active outside. First, exercise is a very important part of the day and it is happening less and less because kids are sitting infront of there computers all day long. There is so much talk these days how we are the fatest country. Well here is one of the main causes we have almost everyone stairing blankly into a computer screen instead of being active. Computers are a big problem and they cause laziness to occure more often than not because now if you miss your favorite @CAPS1.V. show just look online you will find it. Or if you are doing a project just look online and you will find more than enough information and it is just a click away.Second, enjoying nature is a scarse thing now. All you have to do is search online and you could find a picture of your front yard. there are much less people outside. Because who needs to go outside when you could be chatting with a friend or just being on @ORGANIZATION1 looking up new technology. People who are always on the computer don'@CAPS1 care about the enviorment as much because they are wasting electricity and they are more fun to internet on their place that they on. There are a lot less people going places now because who needs to go to @LOCATION1 when you can just look up pictures of @LOCATION1. It's taking away thrills poeple used to have of going places getting out of the house seeing parts of the world far away first hand instead of through computer. Third, there are for less interactions personaly between well everyone. Kids that text, @CAPS2, or facebook chat more then talk in person with friends are loosing talking skills of actually having a conversation. Because online you have time to think then when you talk in person you have nothing to say because you can'@CAPS1 think and your not to your full talking potential. People are seeing eachother less and less now that they can text and talk over the computer they think now have no need to see eachother now and it is ok just to talk through the internet. Friends & family start to know who you are less because you can'@CAPS1 see emotion through a computer. Also, they say that you can learn more about someone in @NUM1 minutes of playing with them then in @NUM1 minutes of talking with them. With that being the case friends make friends now without even knowing that person with full understanding. Lastly, computers are doing more then good to everyone and they are becoming more and more unhealthy. With people getting less exercise, not enjoying nature as much and having less interactions people are just wasting their time infront of a computer screen getting fat rather then going outside with people and just passing a baseball. There are so many better ways people could spend their time than infront of a computer. Why don'@CAPS1 they see that?"	5	5		10

730	1	"Dear Newspaper, The invention of the computer has made a great impact on society today. Although many people would look upon computers on a negative note, the computer allows us to do essential task needed in everyday life. Many people feel that the applications on a computer are @CAPS1 keeps us away from doing other productive activities, but the applications a computer holds is neccessary for must tasks. Apps suchn as  the calculater saves time from doing all the work on a piece of paper. It allows you to do simple or complex math in just less than @NUM1 seconds. Its a great for finding how much a tip is, financial reasons such as now much you have to save, or even dung same basic math or science homework. Another great application is note taking that can easily be typed. This application allows you to take notes by typing, which again eliminates the need to write with a pencil or a paper. Note taking on the computer can be used for easy to read notes to study from to get a good grade on an upcoming test or quiz. The most important and must commonly used application on a computer device is the internet. The internet has over millions of websites for many reasons. If you plan to go to the movies tonight, the internet will surely give you movie times, directions, and how long the movie will be. It is also a great way to plan family trip or to book flights and such. Considering this, the apps are very useful. The computer is also a great device to use for learning. It allows you to look online about new subjects such as far away places or people @CAPS1 would our country be line if we were not educated on the outside world around us? It is also a great learning technique for research. Our teachers today gives us many projects and assignments to learn about new things, and @CAPS1 a great way to research our topic than on the computer. The fashion of the @NUM2 and @DATE1 is just a project I did last month. The computer allowed me to find the garment both women and men wore, @CAPS1 material they were made from, and even now they managed to buy and get the material. The research from my computer gave me a great understanding on my topic and helped me to learned the basics of my topic. You would probably agree that communication can be used in negative ways, but communication is @CAPS1 keep our world spinning. The computer device is one of the many devices used for communication. Email on a computer allows you to send messages to a single or multiple people whatout the need of signal or service. Blogging is also a way of communication on a computer and gives you freedom to express your feeling on education on a certain topic. The instant message is probably the must used by teens. It is quick. It allows you to quickly talk a person without waiting, for reply for more than days. In conclusion, the computer is essential to our everyday life and without the computer, our people would not function!"	5	5		10																					
731	1	"Dear Readers, I believe that Computers do good in our country and have a positive affect too people. This is because it saves paper sending emails and you save money too, also you can learn new things about different countrys like @LOCATION1, and lastly you can iteract with people you know and talk to them and use technowlogy to your advantage. These are a few reasons why computers have positive affect on society and the wayore live. First off computers help save the environment and they do this by leting us not cut down trees and make paper out of them. Do you know how many trees are cut down a day around @NUM1 trees and they are all not imeditly taken to the mills to be turned into paper. But thet stopin piles at loging sites and are leftrotting there not be my put to good work or what they should be. I feel that trees have feelings like us but can't talk with out a mouth. So when you cut down a tree its like robing. Using computers we save trees and stop all that from happening. She one reason why think computers are a positive impact on love and society. Secondly learning you can learn a lot on a computer all you have to do is look for it. I learn many things each day at school because of the help of computers and I feel that is computers are use it can excellour learning and @MONTH1 been a lot more in a lot shorter time then we would have my to find a book or the subject what youre looking for. Computers have made things a lot impact on children but we all new things I when we use computers. So computers are a good thing and a bad thing. Finaly you can talk and interact with friends. techknowlogy has advanced so much that we don't see the world in prospective like take a cell phone for example what do you see mostly likly a phone. But if you open it up what to do you find? You will find a micro computer thats capable of surfing inter playing music just smaller size then before. computers revolutronized the way we look at the world and techknowlogy we can talk and play games usiing this techknowlogy most of what we see every day used with techknowlogy hike, a game station or even a car rardo. adn all of it is used to help using ract with one on toher. So I veiw techknowlygy a so good thing. In conclusion techknowlogy has a positive and negative impact by more positive than negative influence. Techknowlogy help us in our everyday lives and helps save the environment by letting us talk and save paper just by button. Techknowlogy has revolunoized the wat mankind lives and how they veiw society but it us all a good thing in the end. And so I concluded that techknowlogy/computers have a positive and negative impact on socuoty."	4	4		8																					
735	1	"As you can see, technology these days is always getting more and more advanced. It seems as if there is a new invention that atracts many people to buy all the time. One electronic that has been useful in so many ways to people are the computers. Many think to much time is spent on this, but then I think about how much it's benefiting. Computers can tell you pretty much anything you need to know, @CAPS1 it's about same country, or how to solve a problem. @CAPS2, computers are so advanced were you can talk to friends who are faraway. Lastly computers is helping us giving very specific directions, rather than figuring out a map. Say you're doing a school project about a country. By typing in exactly what you need to know you can find your information in a heartbeat. @CAPS1 it's population, density, languages, foods or holidays, computers are the easiest and most simple way to get this information. Or maybe you just want to know about this country because it interested you. Maybe even you plan on visiting this country, you're going to want to know about the place you'll be spending your time. If you do plan on traveling to somewhere you've been researching, you can order your plane tickets right there online. You can figure out the routes you plan on taking, and this can help oprganize your trip. Another reason computers are benefiting so many people, is the feature of communicating with others, @CAPS1 it's taking to a faraway friend or family, or you're bestfriend a couple streets over; you probably still want to keep in touch with them. Computers are so advanced now, that they have webcams; were you can visually see the person your contacting right into the computer. This is a more exciting way to talk to someone, especially if it's someone you don't see often that @MONTH1 even live in another country, @CAPS2, most teenagers like to keep in touch pretty much every day. Usually kids like chatting on instant message just for the pleasure of talking to your friends. Finally, computers are benefiting us with knowing directions and routes. Like mentioned before, computers can give straight foward directions. This is esier to handle rather than useing a map while on the road. There are websites were all you have to do is type in your exact loocation and your exact destination and it will tell you specific roads and turns you need to take. In conclusion, those for who are worried about the ones who should be exercising, being outside, enjoying nature, should learn to expand there time doing so, and shortening time online, and learn to be on the computer, only when necessary."	5	4		9																					
742	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are not bad for society. They actually can be quite good for people. Computers allow us to talk with people online. They can help us in school and give information we need to do things in life. People think they are bad, but all you have to do is look a little deeper and you will find the good in @CAPS7. @CAPS5 people use a @CAPS2, <@PERCENT2@NUM1> of the time @CAPS7 is to talk with people on the @CAPS3, whether @CAPS7 is using video chat or e-mail. People who don't like to use @CAPS2 and e-mail @CAPS10 ""@CAPS4 not use a phone or even talk to them in person."" With e-mail, you can send a message to some one miles away. If you are sending someone a list, a recipe for example. you don't want to @CAPS10 to them over the phone. @CAPS7 would be easier to type @CAPS7 out and then send @CAPS7 to them over the e-mail. ""@CAPS5 my son said. he was going to tech me how to use e-mail, I thought @CAPS7 was going to be a waste of time,"" @CAPS6 @PERSON1, senior citizen. ""@CAPS7 tursns out, @CAPS7 wasn't. Now i use e-mail e-mail every day. Many people think email is a waste of time, but @CAPS7 can help you in your everyday life. The @CAPS3 can helps in @MONTH1 ways also. @CAPS7 can help us get information about various topics. If you are trying to cook a stir fry but you don't know what to put in @CAPS7. You try to call you mother but she isn't there. Your next choise is to look look @CAPS7 up on the @CAPS2. @CAPS7 turns out theres a website that gives a recipe for a stir fry and you follow a do make the best one even. I know for an experience that you can find maps to places on line, since i have to go some is here almost everyweek. Google map is the most used place on the @CAPS3, besides e-mail. Some newspaper have websites @CAPS11 you can read the paper without actually paying for the paper This saves you money and @CAPS7 was less paper @CAPS11 we can save trees. The huge world of the @CAPS3 can change our lives. @PERCENT1 of people that use the @CAPS2 almost everyday are students. Students use the @CAPS2 for many reasons. The biggest one is typing. Students use typing to type reports and e-mail. ""I have messy handwriting"", @CAPS10 student, @PERSON2. ""@CAPS11 if if weren't for the @CAPS2, no one would be able to read my homework and reports. Not even me"" @PERSON2 is the one of many people who are lucking that they harmy typing on the @CAPS2. Another reason students use @CAPS2 is to look up information for reports. If a student puts a bibliography in his report, you will see that he/she used the @CAPS3 @PERCENT2 of the time. There @MONTH1 not be a book in a local library for a student to use, but the @CAPS3 will have many website and blogs for him/her to use. The third reason is for help. There are many website that can help a student to use for help in any subject. The @CAPS3 can help a student pass school. A @CAPS2 can help anyone from talking to someone to helping a student with science. That is how computers are good."	5	5		10																					
743	1	"To use computors, or not to. That is the question. Hundreds of millions of people use computors in their daily life today, but some believe that using computors does not benefit society. It is my firm beleif that they do. Computors provide entertainment, a way to interact with people, and a nearly endless expand of knowledge. Without them, we would quickly find life to be much harder and less fun to navigate. Have you ever been in your house on a rainy day just sitting around bored because there is nothing on @CAPS1? Well I have on many ocations. When that happens, all you have to do is turn on the computer and you have endless choices at your fingertips. You can go on game sites and play thousands of different games. (this can also help improve your hand-eye coordination). You can also watch movies or @CAPS1 shows that you missed or want to watch again. You can even go on sites such as fanfiction.net, and read or write your own stories! Another reason why computers benifit society is that they help you interact with people. You can keep in touch with far away family members and friends using webcams email, and chat sites without the bill that would come with talking on the phone. You can also meet new people from different countries and become their. That way you learn about different ways of life and cultures. You can also quickly contact people in an emergency get updates on events, and comunicate with your teacher if you have a question about your homework. Lastly, and maybe even most importantly, computers are on enormous source of knowledge. Say you wanted to learn how to start a campfire, you could just search, ""how make fire"" a google and @NUM1 matches would be found seconds. Also, if you were asigned a project for school, you could do all of your research easily from your computor, then type the whole thing up on a word document. You can even get a college degree online if you wished. And if you want to find a resturant that specializesin @CAPS2 cooking, you can find one close to you, get directions to it, look at the menu, see the prices get the restaurant's history, cud find reveiws for it all on one magnificent little choice: your computer. So you see, computors benifit society greatly. In fact I don't think we could live without them. They provide us with entertainment, an easy way to interact with people, and a huge source of information. Now, to all of you people who still think computors are bad; I'd like to see you lost a week without using one."	5	5		10																					
752	1	"In my opinion I think that computers have nothing to do with people having lack of exercise or sleep. I think it is all the persons decision to be on the computer as long as they want. The person on the computer obviously does not care if they sleep or not. When people are on the computer I think they dont play as much and start to get fat but that its their decision. Also when the time comes they going to realize that they need to spend less time on the computer and exercise. However, they need a time limit to be on the computer and limited time for eating right and exercising. Being on the computer @NUM1 people dont get the chance to interact with their family and friends because they want to be lazy and stay on the computer. The family and friends get angry and dont want to hang out anymore and within a couple of months they have no friends. Nature is good smells good, looks good, and computers make people stay inside all day! I think we should have more time outside. Also computers sometimes make kids want to not clean their room, not do chores because they are addictid to the computer."	3	4		7																					
754	1	"You need to gather information for a project you're presenting in school, but how are you going to find aout about your topic quickly and easily? Most people will turn to one of the most commonly used piece of technology in the @LOCATION1, the computer. The computer is used for quick and easy research, interacting and communicating with friends and for personal entertainment. Some peol argue that the computer will take away from enjoying nature, spending time with family and friends and exercising. But what if we didn't have the computer? The possability of research, etc. Would be much more difficult. For example: computers help us learn about almost anything quickly and easily. this could help make work for school or jobs less stressful. Also, a computer can be accessed right in your name, so no travel is required. The computer has programs that are used to prepare articles, essays, slide shows and brochures for presentation, as well. If we didn't have a computer, research would be much more of a struggle and could require travel. Computers are one of the most common ways to communicate with friends and family. Websits and e-mail helps you keep intouch with anyone around the world. You can write e-mails, access live chat or even webcam. E-mailing is just like mailing a letter except it is dilivered instantly and doesn't cost anything. There is also no risk of anyone reading your mail. Live chat iswhen you chat over text on the computer. Webcam is face to face interacting which givs off the effect of talking in person: @CAPS1 benefit is that communicates over the computer doesnt cost a thing. Lastly, computers provide games for your personal entertainment, which helps kill boredom. The computer also helps improve hand-eye coordination, along with staying orginized @CAPS2, pictures, videos and more can be placed in files and saved on the computer making it easy for you to open them at @CAPS1 time. Computers @MONTH1 take away from some activities but think of how much harder and more stressful things will be without it. I think that the computer has a good effect on people as well as it being a helpful piece of technology."	5	4		9																					
756	1	"Dear local Newspaper, I am writing this to let you know that many people are spending to much time on computors rather than enjoying nature. People say advances in technology believe that computers have an effect on people in such a way of saying. Many people showed on as is say can use the computers but to remember to think about nature what nice things it has in store for us. Im going to saying that experts are right that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Im thinking that in some points many family members and friends see then other relative person on companion so much on the computers it's like if they are thinking maybe they don't care anymore. Caring about nature and your loved ones is such a great thing. @PERCENT1 of my friends agree with me when I say that people should be less on electronic devices because that can effect your brain or maybe your eye sight (eye vision.) @CAPS1 more and more people should lay off it. @PERSON1 of yale university has conducted extensive reaserch and proven that many computers that are being used by people can be damage of using it every time. I strongly agree with him that there should be a time limit on something to let them later on have the spaare time to enjoy and have fun with nature but something different such as to enjoy listening to soft music. I know you will agree with me when I say that maybe people should spend less time effecting themselves. Whatsoever im hoping from you to agree with my position so this can be possible to break this habit of going on computers and having no time for your family and friends is not such a to start off with."	4	4		8																					
763	1	"To the Local Newspaper, Computers have a heavy impact on, todays society. People depend on them a lot but same people disagree. I think that computers have a positive affect on people. Computers are very entertaining. They can help find long lost friend and keep in contact with them. Plus they can be helpful with homework. Please proceed on reading to see as why I chose these resons. Firstly, computers can entertain. The are thousands of games to chose from. Dress up to educational. Which are good for young children of age five through six. As it states in the writing prompt it teaches hand-eye coordination. In addition to my first reason, computers help long lost friends. There are websites that help you find people. For example @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and yahoo. These websites help keep in touch to, with family. If theres no phone then theres always the computer. Lastly, computers can be helpful with homework. Sometimes you don't even need internet theres a calculator built right in! But a nationwide website thats used and children improve from it is edhelper.com. This website does work sheets and helps with the level the child is on. In conclusion, I think that computers do have a good impact on people. They are entertaining, keeps in contact, and helpful with homework. Please take my reasons into consideration."	4	4		8																					
787	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, spending too much time online has negative effect on society. People aren't getting a full social experience when they talk on email, facebook and twitter. Being on such sites has taken up time that could be spent in other areas, such as family, friends and school. They aren't being able to enjoy the outdoors and being able to exercise. Though online activity can be helpful spending too much time can be harmful. Interacting online can be a great experience for those who have friends and family who live far away. But spending too much time online can damage you social activity levels. In person interaction is better than online, because you see how the person you're talking to is reacting to everything you say. Having a good, positive social environment is benificial to you and your friend. Spending too much time on the computer can also damage you social relationship with your family. For family who live far away, and online is the only way to socialize, online interaction is a great thing to have. But for you close family, you could be missing out on their lives and how they are doing. Your relationship with you family could be in jeoporady because you insist on using your computer. When you use the computer, you're probably eating some food too. And spending time online is taking away your time from exercising those calories off. The obesity level in @LOCATION1 is increasing, probable cause being over-usage of computers. being outside is another thing missing from our lives because of computers we aren't experiencing the beautiful nature life our @ORGANIZATION1 has to offer, online activity is hurting our health, and making us not enjoy our outdoor life. In conclusion, being online too often is abusing our social, health, and taking up too much of our lives. Using the internet is good for adults so they can pay taxes, work at home, and do many other beneficial things for them and their families. But for other, less useful sites are being used to interact. Why not just call or meet up with person, instead of using the computers?"	4	4		8																					
791	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, my name is @PERSON1 and i just want to tell you that we should stop using computers because we get no exercise, we barely go outside and we don't even or talks to our friends or family any more. Local newspaper i think that we should have computer but not because many people aren't doing anything. Many people aren't exercising because their taking on facebook or playing games. Many children aren't even going outside and seeing nature and playing. Many families are all on computers and they are not spending any family time together gofly kites. What im saying is that yeah people like computers and go and talk to there friends and play games but its destroying the parents and and even families. i don't think have computers. Also local newspaper we need to go and the @DATE1 and go doesn't happen. many children go they're on the computer. many parents go hiking, camping, swimming and lots of other stuff but they that anymore. These people need to get a change. What im talking you guys is take the computer away or. One last thing local newspaper is that many kids and children and parents need to have more time. Maybe if and parents weren't all they they would pick that might be sick or ill. Maybe they might go out somewhere to have two together like lake or six flags. many parents that they get computer because it's so fun so they. Many people world complain about it. So i think everybody should be off computers. i think we shouldn't have computer society because you get no exercise, you barely go outside and see nature and you hang out or talk with friends and family so i think computers gone now."	4	4		8																					
795	1	"To whom it @MONTH1 concern: I think computers have a great effect on people. Computers are useful for homework, it allows you to keep in touch with out of state family, you can also look up direction and information to a place. Computers are good for last minute situations. Computers are very useful for homework because when you type a report it looks more professial. While you type a report you can also research on your project at the same time. In some cases there are people who write very slappy to a paint where he or she cannot read his own writing nor can a teacher. A sloppy writer can use the computer to make his or her paper neat. If a child or parent cannot go to the library for some reason they can use their computer at home. If you are a parent at home busy with kids and need to do work; there's no need to go anywhere stay home and use your computer. If a child is absent from school you can go to the school's website and find out the homework. Do you have out of state family you wish to talk to? If so wouldn't you want to be a able to talk to them without a expensive phonebill? A majority of people would say yes. Using the computer to keep touch with family is not so expensive at all! Some examples are aim, emails, and other networks and they don't cast money at all its free. When there's a day you have nothing to do, don't you just want to go somewhere for fun? Don't you want to do something just to get out of the house? Well if there's a last minute decision or situation the computers there to help. Before you go somewhere and you want know a little more go on the computers. Not only will you get information on the place you can also get directions. Now you can go somewhere instead of staying home bored. In conclusion, computers do have a great effect on people. It can be useful to both adults and children. Teachers can calculate students averages easier and faster and children can do their homework efficiently. You can also keep in touch with friends. Overall computers are useful."	4	4		8																					
809	1	"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers do not benefit society. They make people antisocial, unhealthy, and do bad things. The internet is very addictive. I use to spend three hours online everyday. I did not get any exersice at all. Also, I was incouraged to eat unhealthy snacks while online. This made me very unhealthy I gained nine pounds in one week. Now, I have dietbeaties. I can't enjoy things like sweets or running. I will probably have arthritus in my hands when I'm older because I spent hours typing away. I used the computer in the dark so now I need contacts. Using the computer is one of the most unhealthy choices ever. II spent so much time on the computer i wasn't able to socialized. I missed out on alot of activities with my friends and family because I was so busy online. I barely talked to anyone unless it was through email. I lost alot of friends and close family members. My pets died because I didn't take care of them. I didn't really want to do anything but go on the net. I messed up on colledge and job interviews. To this day I have no social life and no job because I spent more time socializing with the computer than people. Computers ruined my life. Computers incourage very bad things. Not just unhealthy choices and antisocial behavior they uncourage things against the law. Alot of drugs and weapons are bought online. People kill others or themselves because people gossiped about them online. People don't care for nature and destroy it. People steal so they can buy extra technology. Alot of car robbers happen because someone left technology in there. People gamble through online poker. People hack bank acounts through the computer. Prostitution happens because of online chats. Thier are sex affenders that go online posing as people that want a date when they are rapists. Terrorists can communicate by the internet. Computers are a menace to society. They turn people into low life scums and criminals. Computers should disposed of before they cause the end of the world."	4	5		9																					
814	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I dont think that computers are something that people should be using @NUM1. Computers have something to them where somehow the become addictive. From the people who are gaining weight every day because the sit on the computer and chat all day. Then there are those terrible people on the internet who disguise themselfs so they look like a @NUM2 year old boy when there really a year old man. Lastly, people now a days are using the computer as a sorce of reading instead of books. I just think that computers are ruining the life of many people. For starters, most people today are becoming overweight because they either wacth to much @CAPS2, or they sit on the computer and eat all day. Once you start with the computer you'll never stop. Especially if your multi-tasking where you eat and use the computer. The big problem is people think it's better to be sitting home than out enjoying nature exercising! It really isn't good that people dont get of the computer and start enjoying life. Next not everyone online is who they say they are who make false accounts on like @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. There can be men who say there and really be @NUM3. With all the posting of pictures someone you with it. Just remember to be careful! Lastly, people in todays day in age use the computer to read books instead of going to the library or @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 (or any book store). I think that all those bookstores are going to run out of business because of the technology now a days. When I was younger and I said that I was going to read a book, I was really reading one. I wasn't reading it on the computer. People need to cut down on the electronics. In the end I think that computers are a real waste of time. There is no reason why people should be on the computer instead of exercise. Everyone needs to stay away from the bad people online. Also can we please start using normal books instead of online ones. I think computers need to stop taking over our world and start just being there when we need them."	4	4		8

I think it's not fair because being on the computer has a lot of benefits, like teaching you hand-eye cordination. Another advantage is that when your on the computer you can chat with people through webcams. Also with a computer you can do homework assignments for something that requires you to do research. And of course when your on a computer, you can watch your favorite movie or t.v show, like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Now aren't these some great advantages? As an adult @CAPS5 pretty sure that you like to do a lot of things from the comfort of your own home, well when you have a computer you can. One way you can keep in touch is by online chatting like through the webcam or my favorite @CAPS6 which stands for aol instant messaging. Surprisingly, another thing you can do is work online by setting it up at work or telling your boss how to do it. By the way your an adult who didn't go to college when you were @NUM1 because you had to work well. If you have a computer or laptop you can go to school online and the best thing is that you'll be in your bed nice and warm without any worries. Now don't you thinkg that is a nice way to spend your @DATE1 @TIME1? When your a kid my age when you have a computer all you want to do is play games online with friends. Well that is what must of us kids do nowadays but our parents don't let us play to much. The only time they let us stay long is when we maybe doing a project for school. But when your a kid besides playing games all day, we also want to learn about things like @LOCATION1 or the @CAPS7 @CAPS8 that's what you. Most people would agree that when you have a computer you can just book a hotel online of going all the way to the hotel. Of course that what my parents do, everytime a vacation they look everything online like the hotel, the, and the. yes having a computer is helpful. Another thing you can do is watch movies online when you are on a plane going to the vacation, because that's what I do with my laptop. But the thing I like the most is watching shows because everytime I watch different episodes of @CAPS9 @PERSON1 the time goes by so quick that a @NUM2 hour flight only seems like @NUM3 hours. Finally, I have explained to you why having a computer is a good thing. One reason is because you can do a lot of things on the computer itself. A second reason is that you can do alot of school work with it like doing a research paper or going to school online. And my final reason was that you can book things online without going anywhere, wasting gas. So now it's your turn to decide whether having a computer is a good thing or a bad thing."	5	5		10																					
840	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I agree that computers do have a positive effect on people. I agree, because being on the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination, helps people learn about faraway places and people, and allows people to talk to other people. By being on the computer it helps teach people hand-eye coordination. So the computer help with hand- eye coordination by using the mouse and keyboard. For example, when you use a computer you dont need to look at your hands while you use the mouse. That helps with hand-eye coordination, because you can see where your hand is without looking. Another example is the keyboard, because while learning where all the keys are you memorize them. Then soon you can type with without looking. The computer also helps you to learn. When you go on the computer the thing people go on is the internet. On the internet people can find information about faraway places or people. So, because the computer has different links and websites, it helps kids and adults everywhere to get information fast. Without the computer everyone would have to go to a library, but what if they didnt have the right information? Then you would need to trace around everywhere to find a book. Thats why a computer is handy. Also, the computer allows people to stay in touch with others farther away. One example of this is that there are chat rooms or groups people can join. So, if a relative or friend is farther away from a more or if they are down the street, with chat rooms it makes talking easier. Also, by these chat rooms and groups it makes a lot of people happy knowing that they can still talk with an old friend or relative instead of loosing them from never seeing or talking to them. That is just another example why the computer has a positive effect. So, with the examples of the computer helping teach hand-eye coordination, makes obtaining information easier and of the many reasons and examples of the computer having a positive effect."	4	4		8																					
846	1	"Dear local newspaper, I have heard about this issue concerning people are on their computer to much. In my opinion, i think that people should not spend so much time on the computer for several reasons. There are the reasons to why I think that people should less time on the internet, and more outdoors. One reason to why I think that people should spend less time on the computer and more times outdoors is so that they can get more exercise. When you get exercise you can lose weight. You can also feel lighter and better about yourself, you will be more active. Another reason to why you should spend more time outdoors than on the computer is because if you don't you will get very very very lazy. If you don't get out and play or exercise, you will become tired. Also, you will become cranky and want do what your parents tell you to do because your mind will be so into your computer screen. My last but not least reason to why we should spend more time outdoors than indoors on the computer is because we can miss out on family fun that goes on. Since people are on the computer so much they miss out an parties and social events. They @MONTH1 also miss out on family dinners and movie night. If you do not want to miss out on the fun, I suggest that you get cuclasses more and stop being a lazy couch potato. As you cansee, there are many reasons to why we should spend more time outdoors doing activities such as going on a bike side, going kout to eat, as even a nice stroll along the heart while walking the dog. I really hope that my opinions means something to you. And I also hope you agree with me. Thank you for your time."	4	4		8																					
850	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever thought about how computers effect human beings? The impacts? The results? The education? I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow people to talk with others online, have the ability to educate in certain areas, and teach hand-eye coordination. Who says the only way to contact or communicate with someone is through letters or the phone? The technology brought upon using computers allows people to talk online with others in a fast, easy, enjoyable way. Have a question that you have to ask a friend, but someone else is using the phone? Write a letter! Oh wait, letters can take up todays and your question is urgent! The computer is an easy alternative for communication. Say you're an amazing singer with a beautiful voice and you want to find an agent more than anything. Computers are so advanced in technology that they can find you an agent in no time. E-mail, websites, @CAPS1, and more, are all ways you can contact that agent. Computers are a great way to communicate. The mind is an extrordinary thing. It can be filled with knowledge, and still have the ability to learn and understand more. Reading books is a fantastic way to learn, but the internet has so much more to offer and you are not only reading from one great author, but tons of great authors. The computer allows you to learn about far away places and important people without making that trip to the library. Have you ever heard of online colleges? They are advertised on @CAPS2.V. all the time. Some people @MONTH1 think that learning from home, laying in bed with a laptop placed in front of them is a distractive way to learn. But what about being comfortable and not intiminated by anyone else around you? Computers can help you get your college degree in a comfortable environment. Hand-eye coordinatin is an excellet and wonderful thing to have. Along with videogames, computer games teach you exactly that. Parents @MONTH1 think we kids are wasting our time playing games on the computer, but we are actually challenging our minds and our hand-eye coordinatin ability. Computers are key when it comes to pysicological learing. Handeye coordinatin is taught to us through games and such that we play without us even knowing it. Hand-eye coordination allows us to catch a ball or play sports, and computers help us acheive that."	5	5		10																					
852	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, With the recent development @MONEY1 technology in todays society I know that there is a lot @MONEY1 controversy with computers. Many people believe that computers are positive towards our society. While others disagree. I feel that technology can be both good and bad. Technology provides great advancements in our world. But people experience less @MONEY1 the outside world when they surround themselves with technology. But I feel that we can find a balance between the two views. Having computers has brought a lot @MONEY1 advancement in todays society. Look at modern medicine, it would be nothing without todays technology in computers. We can look at todays military. Computers practically run todays armed forces. But who knows where technology can take us. Our society could continue to greatly advance with the help @MONEY1 computers. But then again we could all wonder where would we be today without computers. So @ORGANIZATION1, as you can see computers have helped our society greatly with improvement and progression. But with all @MONEY1 this technology we still need to find a balance. It is live todays @CAPS1 spend cover @NUM1 hours per week on computers. People are not experiencing the world outside @MONEY1 their computers. Our state does put in @MONEY1 each year for our parks just so we can ignore them. Also with increased computer time people are not getting outside. They arenâ€™t getting proper exercise. You @MONTH1 even notice that if you use the computer too much you will miss more interactions with your family. So although computers can be very useful you need to be able to turn off the computer and realize the true important things in your life, besides the computers. computers can be both good and bad. But I think that we need to find a balance between the two. Computers are useful to our daily life but at the same time we also need to realize that we need to sometimes take a break from our computers. Lets face it without computers today we would not be able to function. Entire companies revolve around computers and if computers just ended, @MONEY1 @MONEY1 people would lose their jobs. But also regular people, for example teens, do not need to be on the computer for four hours a day. Those four hours could be spent with their families. We need to find a balance. For example, you could say for every hour your on the computer you need to spend that same hour to go outside, spend time with your family, etc. Computers are useful but we cannot over use it. So, to the @ORGANIZATION1, computers help our society thrive. But at the same time we need to learn when we have had enough time on the computer. So I believe that we can call find a healthy balance @MONEY1 computer use."	5	5		10

Kids are now staying up later on the compute, in turn lowering grades. Finally, spending too much time on the computer decrease the amount of time spent with friends and family. Firstly, spending too much time on the computer affects your activity level. The more time spent has on a computer, the less time a person has to do something active, like exercising @PERCENT1 of people spend more than @NUM1 @NUM2 hours on the computer per day, if @NUM3 or so hours were used to exercise or play a sport that number would decrease to @PERCENT2 according to a recent study. Doctors have said that at least @PERCENT3 of overweight parents spend most o ftheir time on the computer, thus limiting their time exercising. The amount of spent on the computer has been shown to decrease activity level and effect the number of overweight and obese people everywhere. If we want to become a healthier country, we should state @CAPS5 writing time spent on computers. Also kids now stay up later on computers and lower then grades @CAPS5 doing so. More time spent on @CAPS1 or anywhere on the @CAPS2 means less time studying, which means lower grades. Kids in spent an average of @NUM3 @NUM2 hours on the computer each day, while kids spend @NUM6 @NUM2 hours each day. A student in @PERSON2 saw their grades improve from a @CAPS3+ to a @CAPS4+ just @CAPS5 spending less time on the computer and more. That studnet also felt more because they get more computer. This tests and quizzes. Computers clearly negative effect on grades and school work. Finally, computers limit the amount of time spent with family nd friends. A student, @PERSON1, said that she, "spent more time going out with friends now that computer isn't up all my time, @CAPS5 doing this, i have a better friendshhip with all my friends than before. "A kid that uses the computer during all of the free time spends @PERCENT4 less time with friends than someone who usues it in moderation. Afmilies also suffer from this a swell. If a family member spends all their time on the computer, the other family members will have less of a relationship with them because they don't talk or do anything together an dwill likely not know what is going on i their life or if something is wrong. As you can tell, computers also have a negative effect on relationships with family and friends. The overuse of computers does nnot benefit society. They affect a persons activity level, students grades and most importantly a persons realtionships with family and friends. In oredr to ake our country a better and healthier place, we must the time spent on computers."	6	6		12

Changed our way of life and have made things easier. I am a firm beliver that computer were one of the greatest invention of all time. Computers have had a very vital and positive impact on society. For example, education has vastly expanded since the computer. Both teachers and students have benefited. Students can now search the intrenet and learn about different places, things in history, how to read and write bette, etc. Also computers have been a major part in entertainment. From reading online news to watching movies and listening to music computers entertain all of us. And computers help us connect with friends and even meet new people.

From helping small buiness thrive by making it easier to make and recieve orders to help spread information globaly computers make this all possible. As I have shown computers have benefited society and have had a positive effect on human beings from educating individuals to staying in touch with relitives, computers have made their mark on improving the way we live. I hope this letter will help show you that computers are a necesary part of the twenty first century."	4	4		8

There's a laptop that will fit in an envelope and a handheld touch screen computer that can almost fit in your pocket. You can type papers and assignments so they're more ledgible. Computers can even score tests. Advancement is centered around computers. Before computers, so many things we do now would seem impossible. But computers open up a realm of possibilities. Typing is faster then hand-writing in some cases and papers can be saved electronically. If our country keeps advancing at the rate, than it is possible to have computers that do maindain chores such as taking out the trash or washing the dishes. There can be computers that talk bark to you like a real conversation. People can learn more and more information and personally advance in intelligence. I look at a computer and think of progress. There are points of computers that are not ideal, but overall, computers are benefitial to society. In a computer, you have access to friends old and new and information from millions of sources.

882	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people use computers more? No they @CAPS2 not use computers more. Computers have many benefits to society but it also have many negitive effects on people who use them. People are spending more time on computers and less than exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. First, people spend less time exercising. Most athletes have to stay fit and healthy to play in there sport. I am a wrestler and a baseball player but if I don't spend some time a day working out or staying active. I will be out of shape and weaker once my match or next game come along. I'm sure olympic athletes work out and stay active daily so they can be stronger and faster than anybody else out there so I don't know why people sit at home on the computer all day. Second, people don't take the time to enjoy nature. Nature is one of the most beautiful things on this planet. Wether you hiking a mountain of a lake, nature is all around you. I personaly love to hunt and fish. I take the time every sumer, @DATE1, fall,and sometimes winter to go out, enjoy nature, and have fun, and so do many other people in the world. Everyone who sits at home on the computer can't enjoy this gift that we have been given. Third, people won't take the time to with family or friends. If you the computer all day ther you can't go out and be active with your friends, or go for a bike ride with you brother. If you are on the computer you on family friend time that could be being used as a fishing trip or a walk in the woods. If you don't spend time with your family because of something you're doing on the computer, then you just a person. You won't valueable thing that you have in life you r family and you @CAPS2 always be able to make time them. Finally, @CAPS2 people use computers more? No, they @CAPS2 not use computers more.

Computers allow people to interact with other people, see and discover other places and people, and teach hand-eye coordination. Computers are helping people more than they are hurting them. First of all, computers allow people to meet and interact with other people. There are many popular websites that allow people to chat and communicate at anytime. Before computers were invented in order to talk to someone you would have to meet with them face-to-face, or send them a letter and wait on awfuly time get a responce. Now people can simply type up an email and hit send. Just like that, their message is sent to another computer for others to read and enjoy. Another advancement computer technology has developed is picture sharing. All one has to do to display and show their pictures to everyone is done by simply hooking up a camera, uploading your pictures onto your computer, and posting them on a site like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 bucket. Any in- the- @CAPS3 person would @CAPS3 that computers are very useful. Secondly, computers are important because they give people the ability to learn about and discover people & places that are new to them. In the old days if you did not @CAPS3 about something or someone, like a movie, you @MONTH1 never find any info about them. Computers have internet websites and search like @ORGANIZATION1, that allow you to type anything and instantly find all the @CAPS4 information and pictures or that subject.

Although computers are not meant to replace your friends, family, and @CAPS5 air, they are very important tools that give you skills you will use for the rest of your life. Any individual that is highly educated would see the pluses in computer usage. in conclusion, computers are vital in order to properly function in many situations. They allow you to chat and send pictures to loved ones, teach you about faraway people and places that you @MONTH1 not @CAPS3 about other wise, and help one improve on their hand - eye coordination. Computers are very useful peices of equipment."	6	5		11																					
887	1	"Computers effect a lot of people. I fully support the advances in technology. I support this because computers can let you talk to people that are faraway from you. Computers also teach hand-eye coordination. In addition, computers let you learn about countrys all over the word. Rapping it all up, electronics should keep advancing. Say your bestfriend moved to @LOCATION4. You won't see her but you can talk to her on the computer. Now in day there are a lot of websites that you can chat off at or you can also do a webcam chat like ovoo. For example, in seventh grade I moved from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2. I was so upset about leaving my old friends. Turns out I was fine. I just made more friends when I moved. I would make plans with my friends over facebook chating. Consequently, computers help a lot you keep in touch with friends all over the world. Computers build up your skills for everything. Hand-eye coordination is the biggest skill that computers teach anyone. When your watching an adult type most of them can type without looking at the keyboard. This is an example of hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is very helpful in sports. In basketball you should dribble and look ahead. Kinda like typing. As one can see computers help with hand-eye coordination. Google gives you answers to anything. If you have research to do most people use google and google is found on the computer. You can learn about @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION4 you name it you can type it in google, and you can learn everything about that country. For example, last year everyone had to pick a state and learn certain things about it. Most people used computers. Computers really are the best electronic in the world. There are many electronics that effect people. But, computers effect people the most. Computers let you talk to family and friends around the world. Also, computer teach you hand-eye coordination skills. Lastly, computer teach you about many countrys. In conclusion, computers should be advanced."	4	5		9																					
892	1	"Dear Newspaper, I often think about the effect of technology on humans. The human race has discovered many things but our biggest advance is technology. New machines are robots are built all the time, and our knowledge of machines and artificial minds is rapidly growing. The most widely used machine is the computer. People use it for all sorts of things, communucation, awareness and learning and entertainment. Some experts are concerned that people spend too much time on computers and it couldn't agree more. Computers maybe useful but they are over used. People spend more time staring at the screen than exercising and interacting with friends and family. Computers are also not always dependable or safe. First of all, the biggest computer users are adolesents. Young adults spend hours on websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 communicating with their friends. At their young age, exercise is very important. Obesity in children from lack of exercise is becoming very common, and its because young people are glued to their computer screens. The averange child need @NUM1 minutes of exercise a day, and many have very little none. I say the computers are ok, but only in small doses. The growing mind and body needs to move and exercise. If internet use among children and teenagers is not cut back, some worry that there will be a lot more health problems in the future. Although it is very east to quickly communicat through the internet, it can sometimes do more harm than good. Kids who spend hours @CAPS4 or emailing their peers spend less time with their families. I've heard parents say they barely see their kids because their always either doing homework. Also, @CAPS5 to @CAPS5 conversations are fading. Because of the internet, people no longer need to get together and talk, @CAPS6 turn on their computers, which is a waste of energy. Why not just go see your friend @CAPS6 of typing all day? Lastly, computers have just as many disadvantages as they do advantages. There are plenty of dangers out there in @LOCATION1. Online predators lurk as many comers, and your personal information and identity can easily be stolen. The risk of any of these things happening is very high. Its better safe than sorry. So, if you think about it, we really don't need computers to survive. You need your exercise, don't blow it off for online chat. Also, its very important to interact and be part of your family, and less internet use will cut down the risk of identity theft, or any other problem or virus. It's your time now. Get outside have @CAPS5 to @CAPS5 conversation with a friend and internet with your family. You can be healthy, happy, and safe without constantly typing any at the keyboard."	5	5		10

I strongly agree that computers have a positive effect on our society. These are my three reasons; you can chat online with friends and family, help people do research on projects, and help people get there jobs done in everyday life. So please, local newspaper keep reading and I will change your mind about computers effects on people. Do you have family or friends who @CAPS1't live around here that you want to keep in touch with? Using the computer for email or a chat site like facebook will do that. I have cousins who live in @LOCATION2. The only way my family can keep in touch with them not spending money is email. My mom and her sister are sending emails to each other all the time. If you ask me I think that is a positive effect computers have. Have you ever researched anything using a computer? I knew I have! For a school project in @CAPS2 I had to research about @LOCATION1. I did all my research on the computer. I got an A+! I would not have gotten that grade if I did not use the computer to do research. Do you use a computer in your job? Well even if you @CAPS1't I know a lot of people who do. For example, my dad uses a computer for almost the whole day he is at work. He is a @CAPS3 @CAPS4 which means he managed portfolios. He has to use @ORGANIZATION1 to check on the stock chart. Another example is my mom, teacher, she has using the computer to email parents if the student need help or up. So as you can see computers have good effect on our society. These are my reasons : you can chat online with friends and family, helps people do research on projects, and helps people do research on projects, and helps people get there jobs done in everyday life. I hope you agree that computers have a positive effect on our society. Say yes to computers good effect!"	4	4		8

We need computers for life, and that doesn'@CAPS1 make use lazy and forget full it makes us busy. The only situation with someone who is online being lazy is with a teenager playing games. But the only reason some kids do that is because they all dont want to go and exercise or run around with their family who they see everyday. But because they want to talk to their friends make plans and just talk while they play togeather. If someone is ignoring their family or becomeing more lazy, it is because that is their choice to sit around and do nothing. And I do agree that people are becomeing over weight but I think that is because some people consider a workout to be an hour of lifting and running once a week. And that isn'@CAPS1 right. I think that this news paper should post up adds about gyms and maybe that will lower the faty meter in our town. or if they think people are neglecting their families have people work less so they can go home and see their families. As for teens I think you parents out there need to set some rules like @NUM1 hours of play a day, @NUM2 hours on a @DATE1, and if they don'@CAPS1 listen take the game away for a day of two, but that might not get them to spend time with you because they @MONTH1 be mad, but it will get them outside or atleast doing somehting more active and not watching @CAPS1.V. or playing video games all day.

""@CAPS9 this technology many of the decisions made in @LOCATION1 and @CAPS10 wouldn't be made and many solders would have died as a result."" @CAPS11 final reson that I support this decision is that they help teach you hand eye coordination. One of the ways that computers teach hand eye coordination is throug video games and simulations. In video games people make it @CAPS7 you to react at a movements notes in order to compleat your objective. In the @ORGANIZATION1 computer simulations teach the soldiers how to react to many different situations. Through this situations, many sledres have learn how to servive in combat and save many of their fellow comredes. ""The simulations we have invested in have improved combat effectevness by over @PERCENT1"" stated general @PERSON2 of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS12. ""@CAPS9 theise simulations many more american lives weold have ben lost in recent wars."" @CAPS14 now that you have heard all of @CAPS11 resons of why I support computers. I hope you are much more informed about this topic @CAPS9 computers we wouldn't be able to learn about foren lands, talk to people instantly, or have as good hand eye cooordination. I hope everyone else will see @CAPS11 resons for supporting computers."	5	5		10																					
910	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, In the @DATE1 computers have help man kinds. Computers are every where in a schools, homes band business across a @CAPS1. They help people in many ways depending on the what the person wants to set done. The ways that I use my computer is by staying in contact with my friends, a family, and it also helps me with my school work. I have been a live for @NUM1 @DATE1 and have already live in @NUM2 different states: @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and now @CAPS2 you would think I would have had lots of friends living in so many places. How do I stay in contact with them you @MONTH1 use? I use various and @CAPS3. If you get rid of computers I would not be able to stay in contact with tem anymore. Moving from place to place was very hard and sad thing to do for me. Another hard thing to do for me was moving away from my family, but thank to technology and computers I stay in contact with them. Imagine you haven't seen you family in @NUM3 @DATE1, well sadly thats my life so many birthday @CAPS4 all the family you can see is you parents. School another great example where society benefits from computers students and teachers use them everyday to learn. In my opoion learning is the greatest thing. One of my friends, @PERSON1, said this about the dell computers we use in the library "@CAPS4 ever u don't get something about what we learned in @CAPS5 class that day. I use the computers to better understand it. Computers are a great way to research a topic, and thats why they should not be gotten rid of. I use computers every day for two reasons for school, researching or writing a project for any of my classes. Everyday I spend at least @NUM4 our writing something up for school. Computers help lessen the time spend writing it because it is fast and easy it is easy to type something, like a @CAPS6 paper on the ways to persuassive the readier. In the end computers are something we I need in are life because it makes life simpler. If I was to send a message to some of my friends in @LOCATION2 through @CAPS7 it would take seconds. Instead if I was to use the @ORGANIZATION2 it would take days. A life with out computers is a lot harder to do things, that we cant make simpler with computers"	4	4		8																					
913	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I have been informed that recently, people are questioning the use of computers. Some say computers have negative effects on people when using them but I for one disagree with that statement. I believe that computers in today's society have created an atmosphere of learning, communication, and an ideal amount of creative fun. Computers are changing the way everyday people live. This technology is the basis of our future, and our future has evolved around our computers. People learn so they can become better at things, be aware of what is going on, and to gain the knowledge that possibly help mem succed in life. Computers gona access to information that people want to know whether it is to learn how it dance using youtube.com, to learn about a possible vacation spot your family might visit, or to research a topic for a school paper: computers have it all. It sits right at home so there is no need to drive to the library and wait for a book with the right researching skills, almost anybody can find the exact information they are looking for. Computers contribute to people who want to learn. Being a popular used computer have beenimportant to make them the best. Whether that means faster internet better, researching book or more websites, a computer has it all. Back before the telephones was invented, people struggled to have a reliable source of communications with where communication is important because it is the main source of communicating. Through the computer, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and emails are easy and guarenteed ways to talk to everybody. With just a simple click of a mouse a person can talk to their bestfriend as if they were right next to them. Communication plays an important role for a civilization or society. It makes life so much easier without creating a place where people become lazy. Talking to people by using the computer has become easier and more dependable than ever. People can email their teachers if they have a question for homework, people can check there grades online, and people can talk to their friends and family all they want whenever they want. So we people say that the computer. If a sibling is away at college, their @CAPS3, when a family is to gether, they could since new things are discovered through the computer everyday. can come to a person in multiple ways. A computer can emphazize the fun is never a bad thing. Computers offer video games, learning games, and that bring creativity to. This technology gets people every to have an open mind with everything. It allows them to have fun but at the same time learn something about the world or even themselves. Sometimes computers can inspire people to do something like start a group to make the environment better or go running around ther block. Even though the actual computer is inside the fun and creativity can be whenever a person wants it to be. Computers expand a person's knowledge, allow one to communicate, and create a whole new word of fun. Researching topics can be easily accessed through a computer. Communicating with others makes life easier and having fun while inspiring people everywhere makes computers have a total positive effect on people. It creates a new atmosphere of enjoyment of different things. Computers effect people in the greatest way and I don't know why some people doubt its magnificent ways of indudging people in the environment."	5	5		10																					
914	1	"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, I am against that computers benefit society in anyway. Yes computers are a great way to learn about things all over the world, but people have to worry about what is right in front of them. Being on the computer all the time gives less time of exercising, no sight of enjoying nature, and gives less time of interacting with family and friends. Computers don't benefit everyone because it gives less time of exercising. When people don't exercise because they are busy always doing something else less important, then you would always be tired. You won't want to do anything but just sit around & do nothing which calls for laziness you would go weak without exercise. You wouldnt have the strength to eat or lift anything which calls for your bone to go weak and you wouldn't get the calories & calcium & vitamins that your body needs to be strong. You would gain weight which calls for you being out of shape. Since your body has no exercise the weight & fat just stays. Being on the computer doesn't help you enjoy nature the way that you are supposed to. You will never see the world for what it is. You will always miss out on fun activities, then when people start talking about how much fun they had you're going to wish you were there. And you will always be stuck in the house which is going to get boring & there's nothing fun to do. If you're always on the computer cell the time you will never interact with family & friends. That is mostly & always more important than computers because they are always always going to be there for you. You will miss out on fun important occasions with your family because you're so addicted to the computer. And your friends will stop being with you because you're not hanging out with them. Computers really don't benefit everyday people because you miss out on the greater things of life. You will miss out on exercising, nature and especially family and friends. Then you are going to wish that you had spent time with them instead of the computer because you are going to see they had a great time & you would want a great time too!"	5	4		9																					
917	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, the effects computers have on people are good. I believe this because people can learn hand-eye coordination, they give the people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and they even allow people to talk with people from around the world. Firstly, effects computers have on people are good because the people can learn hand eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is good in many occations. Secondly, computers effects on people are good because computers give the people the ability to learn about faraway places and people is important becuase people can learn about history and important figures in life. Lastly, the effects people have from computers are good because computers allow people to talk with people from all around the world. This is usefull because the people can learn about each other, their customs and religious and also their cultures and heritage. All-in-all, I believe that computers have good effects on people because they can learn hand-eye coordination. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people and computers even allow people to talk with people online from all parts of the world."	3	3		6																					
931	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have both good and bad effects on people. Some people just sit around all day playing games and being lazy. Other people actually use their computers for things that they need. Also some people need their computers for their jobs. I do agree that some people who spend all day in front of their computers are spending less time exercising! Would you rather play games all day instead of spending some quality time with your family and friends? Not me, I would much rather be with friends outside or having a family picnic at a park or lake. For other people though, the story is much different. Some people need computers and other advances in technology for their everyday life. A lot of jobs today require you to use a computer, for example working at a bank you use computers all day! I also think students rely on computers to do work too. A lot of students type up reports and other things for school on their computers. Students also use computers to look up information. The internet can be a very good source for students. I know for me, the internet has come in handy for school projects, or maybe something as simple as just looking up a word. I can also see why people dont really care about advaces in technology or computers! Some people dont need them for anything, and some are probably thinking people are on them way too much. To me, I honestly find computers useful because I can talk online to my family in @LOCATION1. I hope you liked my opinion about computers, remember, they are useful to some people, but not all."	4	4		8																					
936	1	"Dear @LOCATION1 news paper, I think computers are a bad and good thing because computers keep some people inside more than usual and then on the other hand a computer allows you to talk with family members that you haven't seen in a long time, search for upcoming events and see if they are canceled and to search up other stuff like when a movie is playing. Computers are a big part of school too, because without computers it would be hard to study and for some teachers most of their homeworks aquires you to use a computer. There is some other things that are bad about computers too for example: my friend stayed on his computer playing video games for most of the day. Its like when he's on that computer he dosen't listen or hear anyone, not even his parents. He barely goes down to eat dinner and when he does he has his laptop right beside him. His parents started to get tired of it so they took his tv and laptop away so he could go outside and play with his friends. After a while he started to come outside a lot mostly every day when it was nice. They gave him back his computer and tv. The only time he goes on it now is rainy days."	3	4		7																					
952	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I agree with the concerned experts, im sure many others agree also. I bet you that if you keep reading it would be understandable, why I agree. First of all, too many people spend to much time talking with friends online. I think that once you start talking with them online, finish up the conversation face to face or by telephone. Talking online is a great way to connect with friends and people you haven't seen in a long time, but too much of that can start problems. For example rumors. In my opinion when friends get to excited online they decide to start rumors about other people and it ends up being sent to almost everybody. Another example is online arguing which can lead up to many problems like fighting when you get back to school. How would you feel if you turned on your computer and find out that someone has been talking about you or that someone is trying to start a fight with you? I'm positive that you would not enjoy it and your feeling might be hurt. Next reason is, being on the computer too much can effect most peoples grades. Many people are going home and turning on their computer instead of doing their homework or studying. There are many people who go to my school and their grades have declined because of online usage. Pretty soon many people will be held back because they have failed the school year. For example, picture yourself as a parent and getting your child's report card and find out they have all @CAPS1's or mostly @CAPS2's. You wouldn't like that either. Lastly, computers have cause another problem called bullying. Too many children are being bullied online and they are being hurt. Those children who are being the bullies are enjoying it while the children who are getting bullied are sad. Thinking that nobody cares about them. Bullying has caused death or many other problems. Imagine, being someone, getting bullied and your feelings are really hurt, you dont talk to an adult or a parent all you end up doing is killing yourself. Picture how many parents are upset and how yours would be too to find that their child has been bullied to death, it really hurts them. And i'm sure if you were one of those parents you wont be too happy. In conclusion, being online too much has an effect on everybody and"	4	4		8																					
957	1	"Dear Local @CAPS1, I am deligted to write this letter to you. It has come to my attention that the people who support advances in tecnology believe that computers have a positive efffect on people. I agree with those people. I agree with them because one: you can communicate with your family and friends via email, via @CAPS2, via @CAPS3 ets. Number two: you can use a computer for research, and number three: it can tell you directions or give you info. on a resteraunt or place you want to go. I will now get into more detail on these three topics. You can communicate with your family or friends via computer. For example my friend amor, when we were best freinds and we were in third grade, he had to move to @LOCATION1. I cried the first day he moved. then the next week or so I got an email from him and so now we can keep in touch with each other. He comes & to @LOCATION2 every @DATE2 and we hangout with each other. Maybe one day, I will like to go visit him now In @LOCATION3 becasue he moved again, but I will have to do some research on @LOCATION3 first. With a computer you can research alot of things like this year our language @CAPS4 class read a book called ""my brother @CAPS5 is dead"" and it was a true story. Se we had to some research on the book and I found out that without computers how would I be able to research anything on the website it shared where everything , a description of the thing, and how to get there (diretions). Directions are very important. The show you how to get to a certain destination. You can get directions off a computer. I remember one year I had to go to my friends birthday party and we didn't know how to get there. So I went online on @DATE1 and we got the directions from there and we printed them out and we found the place in @NUM1 minutes. Without a computer we would have been able to find the house easily. You @MONTH1 disagree with me on this because a computer can have bad websites and can also became very addicting to some people, but I think I am right. Thank you for reading this letter, once again computers are good for the study!"	4	5		9																					
963	1	"Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that people do spend a lot of time on computers, alot of teens spend alot of time on computers, I also think this from my own experience and I surveyed @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class. I would first like to expand my idea of teens spend alot of time on the computer, some teens go on the internet and do homework or might check their emails others go on @CAPS1 for hours and got addicted, so they're not outside or doing sports. In my own experience I used to have a @CAPS1 and I woud be at it for the whole day and I woud miss out on hanging with my family and friends. So I deleted the account. But, I still feel addicted to the computer I'm always listening to music or chating with my friends or checking my emails like most people The things* And lastly else to @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class, @PERCENT1 of people a day on it, @PERCENT2 said that they spend @PERCENT3 of people. That they now go on the computer. These that just one @NUM1 grade class most students are addicted to it.* no matter what age. This is why I believe that people do spend to much time or the. Many students go on @CAPS1 for hours at a time and in my own experience I have been addicted to the comp. and @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class when I surveyed them there ans a very high percentage of people that said they were addicted to the computer. So parents please tell your children if they need to spend less time on the computer."	4	4		8																					
967	1	"I Believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers are a relatively new invention, they have become very popular. Computers allo people to talk online with each other. They also allow students to complete homework assignments and important projects. Computers also allow people to store important files and pictures in places that won't get lost. Computers are helpful in so many ways, but these are just a few. Computers allow people online. whether @CAPS3's through email, instant messaging, or a video chat, computers peplace old and haved ways @ORGANIZATION1 communication. For example, instead @ORGANIZATION1 writing a letter to someone, mailinbg @CAPS3 to them, and having to wait two days for them to receive @CAPS3, email them! Obtain an email address, type a message, and click send. They will receive the message instantly, and even reply soon enough @PERSON1, president @ORGANIZATION1 the @ORGANIZATION1, says, ""Computers are an important part fo technology. People use them everyday."" @CAPS1 them everyday doesn't mean just for fun. @CAPS3 also helps with work. Three out @ORGANIZATION1 four adults who used computers say that they help them with their work and social status. Computers are a part @ORGANIZATION1 everyday life, and they can help with almost anything. Computers allow students to finish homework and projects quite fst. Instead @ORGANIZATION1 hand-writing that four-page essay on @PERSON2 @CAPS1 textbooks and use the internet for finding information. Computers also allow students to email teachers in case @ORGANIZATION1 missed classes and assignments. @CAPS4 @PERSON3, a student at @ORGANIZATION2 who had missed quite a few days @ORGANIZATION1 school, says, ""@CAPS2 I had to do was email my teachers, and they sent me @CAPS2 the homework assignment. I missed @CAPS3 was that easy."" @CAPS4's not the only one who agrees that computers are a big help. Millions @ORGANIZATION1 kids & adults agree. Computers not only let students write reports; they also allows them to save them for future uses. They also save important files and precious pictures. Everyone hates @CAPS3 when their camera or video camera breaks, and will their precious and wonderful memories are gone. Well, just save them to the computer, and they're there forever! @NUM1 out @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM2 people who store @CAPS2 their pictures in a computer agrees this is the best way to do @CAPS3. In conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on people. They allow people to talk online. do homework & projects, and store important files. I can assume that everyone agrees with me that computers are an important part @ORGANIZATION1 everyday life. We just woudn't be the world we are without them."	6	5		11																					
968	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, I think computers are a great tool for everyone if they use it right. Here are my reasons why. First of all, I think computers are good because news travels quickly. Using the internet, world changing news can spread like wildfire and inform everyone in seconds. It is great for staying in the loop and reading about things you need to know. This reminds me of the time when a massive earth quake hit @LOCATION2 and traumatized its citizens. Within moments of the accidents, it was already circling the internet. This brought mass attention to @LOCATION2 which caused many people to donate and needed items. Secondly, the computer is also good for researching topics for school and common interest. If you need facts for a school project you can easily search what you need through the internet wide variety of search engines, you will be able to pin-point exactly what you are also look up things that interest you. If you have a favorite sports team, band, or are interested in a famous figure, you have tons of information on them at your disposal. You can do all of this within the privacy of your on home so you can remain as secret as a @ORGANIZATION1 agent. This reminds me of the time when are of my idols died. Within seconds of hearing the tragic news I was able to search the topic and get an endless uphoria of information regarding his death. Finally, you can chat with someone from around the world if you wanted to! Using social networking sites like facebook and myspace, you can connect with your friends and chat with them for hours on end. You can also enter chatrooms with people who share a common interest with you. Just like how I talk to people about a band we both love. I believe access to news, research, and staying in touch with your friends is without a doubt the best reasons to use a computer. What are you waiting for? Get one!"	5	4		9																					
970	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @DATE1's society is much more different from what it was like twenty years ago. We have phones that can easily allow us to browse the web as we please just like a computer. Our access to such a large network beings us together, can broaden mental horisons and keep many @CAPS5 hard workers on key point so that when time for work comes around, they are ready. Not everyone agrees that technology is benefit to our growing well, but I believe it keeps us moving forward and away from ignorance in all of its forms. Our construction workers work hard during their busy seasons. They vigorously build sley scraping towers, educational fucilities, additions to our health center, and even the very places we call home. However, when weather is not on their side and building anything can be hazzardous in the long run, they must still ramain at the ready when duty calls. Lately, there has been an advancement in technology to help chane opperators maintain their skills during their of season vistually. It @MONTH1 appear easy to the untrained spectation. To one it @MONTH1 seem like all they do is seat themselves in a pull a few levers, and push a few buttons. However, there is in fact a persition to such a task. Pull the lever to quickly and the crane can go sharply in the wrong direction causing it to tip over. One of feild reponters tried the @CAPS1 virtual trainer and found a @CAPS1 appreciation for the jobs at our builders. That just goes to show that @CAPS5 one does not keep such skill in check, they could in fact cause a serious malfunction on a construction site. I, personally, find it very entertaining and at the same time educational to learn a language different from my own. In fact, I teach myself @CAPS4 at home. However, @CAPS5 I did not have a computer at home, my studies would be near impossible. With @DATE1's economy going to a class outside & school, or even hiring a personal tutor, can be enough to effect anyones budget emensly. The internet provides an efficient low casting, or even free, way to help any language learner. One can even find study tips from native speakers at those who have already learned vast bit about the language. In @DATE1's society not everyone has the time to go to he library and pick up a book on a country they are interested in. Some @MONTH1 say that asking a neighbor about their home canbe just as afective, but that can awkward for those that don't particulary do well in face to face setting. However, havbing a complete at hand can make learning an enjoyabl experience. Once can find blog posts about someone's visti to there country of interest & even videos of their time there. Websites made entirely for those interesting a particular culture can also prove helpful. On the other hand, @CAPS5 someone were to be looking for and acception vacation spot recommended by locals, that information can be found as well. Some people do not love in an area where they can connect with family by a simple call or a drive. One @MONTH1 have to take a plane or pay to take with relatives. Social networks on the web makes connecting with lvoe ones easier and more affordable. The speed of instant messaging can make it seem like they are in the same room instead across the ocean. I hope that everything I have fare travel can serve a purpose to someone who has not been able to find way benefits to technological advances. Please do remember that technology can serve as a skill maintenance tool, educational, and as a connection for our foreign born citizens. Thank you for"	5	6		11																					
976	1	"Dear editor, I see that there is an argument between computers being good or bad. I think that my oppinon can help your decision. I think that computers are good. I think they are good because they help kids with social skills, they help people with bad handwriting and they help people learn about things around the world. First of all computers help kids all around the world with social skills. They help them because these is so many ways to communicate with people through the computer. There is instant messaging and webcaming websites. Also a servey said that @PERCENT1 of parents say that the computer raised there kids social skills a lot. Another thing the computer helps with is people with bad handwriting. It helps because you can go on microsoft word and instead of writeing a great report that no one can read you can type I that when I have a paper for school that neatness counts on I always up my report. This can help alot of people who cant write as well as others because on the computer you change the font and everything to make it look as nice as you want. The last reason I think the computer is a good idea is because alot of people dont like to read newspapers and watch the news so they like to research certian subjects they like, to know whats going on around who world. I know my mom doesn't have time to watch the newest the newspaper but when she checks her email the first thing that pops up is the bigest news of the day. People all around the work go so the computer to find of the latest news. I hope you consider my oppinon when you make you decison, where you go think of all the kinds of people it helps. People with social problems, people with bad handwriting, and just busy people who cant sit down and watch the hour news. Thank you for your time."	4	4		8

I have @NUM1 good reason why I think people are on the computer a lot. @CAPS1 first reason is people are losing time. Second not that much engry. Third you just spending your life on the computer keep on reading why I don't agree that it befits society to people. People losing time to have fun. They do have any time for friends family, pets, and scuh more. It mostly adicaution to go on website like facebook, myspace, @CAPS2, and such more people just need to get off the computer and have fun outside. Mostly people dont really get that much engry. Some people are always inside they just need engry. Fresh our will help that maybe going to the gym or jog outside for a while. Being inside isnt really good for you. Just being inside just make you kinda gang weight. And then you wouldn't have anytime with your friends, and more only if your inside like always. Fineally you spend all your time at home being computer. And you don't have anytime, engry and such more. YOu spend all your time inside computer cool technology but you don't need to be on it @NUM2. You just have time for friends and family. Now you know @CAPS1 opinion why computers are benfit society. People are losing time and everything. People dont have anymore engry.

Some of the great benefits of having a @CAPS3 are talking online with friends, learning about new places and things everywhere, and being able study for and tests from the internet. First, being able to talk to distant friends and relatives is now passive with the @CAPS3. Facts show show that @PERCENT1 of families in the @LOCATION1 have distant friends with @CAPS2, now all of these people can tlk to each other! Ill never forget the time that my close freinds moved, but i was still able to talk to him @CAPS5 of the @CAPS3. Second, the @CAPS3 allows you to learn about new places and things all around the world. I never would have I know about some of the places I've been to if it was for comoputer, @ORGANIZATION1 stated that the @CAPS3 expert @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS3 are the reason we have in much without @CAPS3 wouldn't know about the places."" @CAPS4, it is now possible study without @CAPS5 of the @CAPS3, @CAPS6 can be done on the internet online. I'll never forget the that I forget my book, but I @CAPS1 still study @CAPS5 of the online book.

984	1	"Dear local newspaper, I agree that computers benefit us totaly. This lets people explore the world and do anything. Also, computers are used for many things. Last but not least @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 households have at least one computer. So computers lets us do anything and everything. It helps most people with their jobs, college/school, and you can even buy a house or car online. It doesn't cost that much and its very usefull. You can look up facts you need or even play games when your bored. It keeps us in touch with the world. Also, many thing require a computer. For example, In order to play xbox live you need a computer with @CAPS1. Xbox live lets you play video games with other people or even your friends. Some homework requires computers and some colleges are only on the computer so you can stay at home. Anything you need you can find it on the computer. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 house hold have computers, or @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 does. I agree that some people waste their time, but without computers everything would be much harder. For example, say you need to having to wait @NUM5 days for the mail. Just @CAPS2-mail it. Most people wouldn't have a job if it weren't for computers. It saves peoples time and lets them do other things except have to drive somewhere to give a letter to them. So I think computers are a huge benefit. Like I said you can do anything. Like @CAPS3. It keeps you in touch with friends if your on vacation from school. They are also used for several different things like downloading music on your @CAPS4. Also, @CAPS5 everyone has a computer. If scientists are going to complain about computers than why do they use them? I think computers are great! But whats you opinion?"	4	4		8																					
1002	1	"Dear Local newspaper, I think computers are great sources. They help us instanly when we have to find something. Computers are very helpful and they are easy to use. Once you have mastered the computer it feels like you can do almost anything on it. Computers are great but the can also have negative effects on us too. I like, computers but I am going to say I am against them. When people get on their computers it's like they're in another world. When your on the computer you are alot less socal than you would be if you not on the computer. On don't know about you but alot of people are addicted to their computers. They get on an they stay on forever. The act like it is a neccesity to be on the computer every day. I do not have to be on computer websites like @CAPS1 and here is why. Compters get really annoyting sometimes. They distract people alot. Like the other day my sister and I were going to @NUM1 walking but we didn't go because she wouldn't help us exercise so we shouldn't be using it. In this economy it is important to have socal skills. Instant messaging people doesn't mean you are going socal skills. You actually have to get out and talk to people face to face. When I am on the computer to long I know. I know this because my eyes start to hurt. This is bad for your eye sight. People sit in their houses and just stare at the bright screen. They @MONTH1 not know but that is blinding so they must not stay on the computers long. These were some reason why you should not use the computer. I am not saying that it is an evil contraption I'm just saying, use the computer for info and work not for games and other things. You could be outside having fun instead of sitting up in your house so get out! Go make some real breathing friends in person."	4	4		8																					
1004	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people have computers in there house hold but they disagrees with a computer can help you. There are some advantages in useing computers such as being able to search information able learn hand-eye coordination, becomeing organized, but it also has it's disadvangtages like children spending more time on the computer rather than going out side and playing with friends and exersizeing and staying fit. I agree with computers do produce a positive impact on children. Computers not only let a child stay in contact with their family that live faraway but it can also help them get a progect done more eveficantly and quickly. It @MONTH1 seem that where are doing one thing but when in fact we can be uploading pictures and movies, downloading muisc and playing games at the same. Now with all that I have told you @DATE1 I hope that we share the same point of veiws on computers like how they are good to have and their positive in part."	3	3		6																					
1005	1	"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Experts say that computers are ""taking over people"", I strongly disagree. People spend the amount of time they need and want then become active or spend time with family and friends. Computers allow people to learn, they allow people communicate to family and friends, too. Also, @CAPS5 people use computers for work and jobs. I believe computers allow people, like myself, to learn. You can learn also @CAPS5 things on the computer. You can learn about other countries, you can read articles on news, also. You can learn different languges and about the world. Online people can communicate with others. There is skype, which allows you to communicate with others while on the internet, you use a webcam. there is also instant messanger, or @CAPS3. @CAPS3 is like having a conversation with a person who's right next to you! Then there is email which can send letters, photos and comments. @CAPS5 people use computers for work. Microsoft @CAPS4 allows you to type stories and type letters. @CAPS5 people do job reports on @CAPS4. Also, the internet is helpful for work. Websites and search engines help you a lot. Websites can contain information that working people need. To finish this letter, I want to say that @NUM1) Computers allow people to learn. @NUM2) They allow people to communicate with friends and family. Lastly, @NUM3) @CAPS5 working people use the computer for work and reports. I hope I influenced you to see why computers aren't bad."	4	5		9																					
1022	1	"Dear Local Newspaper: Are computers possitively affecting society? As technology advances, humans are relying on them more and more; most people use them daily. I believe computers effect people possitively because they help write papers, are a social tool, and are a big help with research. After reading this letter there will be no doubt that computers have a possitive effect on people in society. My first reason why computers have a possitive effect on people is they help with writing papers. Whether it is writing a resume, a science report, or a spreadsheet, none of these are ever seen nowadays done by hand. Everyone expects to see the flawlessly inked letters on the printer paper in whatever piece of writing it is. This helps the people writing the paper because writing takes many drafts to get the piece perfect; it is a pain to write each draft by hand. In additio, it is easier to read someone's writing @CAPS1 its typed, especially @CAPS1 the writer has hand writing. However, computers help in more than just writing papers. My second reason why computers passitively effect people is by being a social tool. Many websites online these days have social networks such as youtube, facebook, twitter, and myspace. In the listed websites above and many others as well, people can meet other people through other friends and games. The nice thing about meeting them online is that you don't have to plan a time to meet the person, @CAPS1 you are both online you guys can begin chatting. The chatting also helps @CAPS1 people have long-distance relationships, whether friends, mates, or family. Online chatting help people stay in-touch with someone they might not see everyday. That is a big help with everyone's social life, keeping then us ""the "" @CAPS2, online sites like eharmony or match.com take people with little time to worry about love and match them with their perfect mate. This also helps people who are shy get married and start a family. This helps people live happier lives, another possitive effect. Finally, computers possitively effect people by making research much easier. My dad always says ""You kids got it easy. @CAPS1 I was growing up, we'd to go to the library and spend hours researching before we could write our papers."" @CAPS3, its simple. Using the internet and a search engine, all you have to do is type a topic and you can get all the latest articles in just seconds. Libraries might not have the most recent books, or someone might've checked out your topic's book. Then what can you do? The internet is also an extremely useful help @CAPS1 the research topic is very specific, if its a certain becteria or species that a book @MONTH1 only briefly mention. The internet has a much broader range of articles, so it is much easier to find information for any topic. With research, taking less time to understand, people can spend more time enjoying the day, like playing outside, than in the library stressing because they cannot find a book on their topic. This is a strong reason why computers should not be seen as a negative effect on society. To conclude, computers have a possitive effect on society, because they help write papers, they are a social tool, and are a big help with research. Where would we be if we had to handwrite everything? Think about how many fewer friends or maybe even relationships we would have without social websites. What about how hours of research are @CAPS3 two clicks away? Computers have changed our lives for the better, and we should appreciate all the do for us."	6	5		11																					
1028	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know that two out of three @CAPS2 own a computer? Computers are a very helpful tool that benefit everyone in society. They allow people to communicate with eachother, learn, and teach hand-eye coordination and other good things for school.. Computers are a very useful and beneficial part of society. The advance in technology has upgraded computers, and now allows people to communicate through them. For example, new webcams allow people to actually see and talk to each other from you computer screen. This allows people no matter how far to talk to each other and stay in touch. With my webcam I am able to keep in touch with my cousins in @LOCATION1. Another way of communication is through email. Through the internet, people can type messages back and forth. It is very fast and easy allowing people to talk to each other more and communicate. As well as webcams and email computers grants people access to communication websites such as @CAPS3 (instant messaging) or @CAPS4. These websites people message each other back and forth very quickly and easily. It is not difficult to do, like writing a letter would be, so people can communicate more efficiently and easily. Computers are very helpful for communication along with @CAPS6. Computers are an advancement that could help people learn more about anything. For instace, they could learn about foreigh plaus. All they would have to do is go to the internet, type what they were @CAPS5 for, and it would come up on the screen. It would allow people to learn about places all over the world. Also, people can see pictures on the computer. For example, if someone wanted to go on vacation faraway, they could type in the place and see what it looks like. However, the computer does not just show places. People could also see animals, other people, the environments, and anything else they want to learn about. Plus, with new websites being created, people could actually see what the earth looks like from space. They can look at houses, the wonders of the world, and much more computers give people the opportunity to learn about so much more. @CAPS6 more would help people, especially students to have a better education. If you ask anyone in school, they will tell you that computers are a very useful tool. Firstly it allows them to type. Students can type a project or paper on the computer faster and easier. It will also look neater and more orginized. Plus, computers teach students hand-eye coordination. By typing or even just clicking the mouse, students are bettering their coordination. This is due to the fast while they are @CAPS5 at the screen and typing or clicking, they have a sense of direction and know what to hit or where to put their hands without even @CAPS5. Lastly, computers help students because if they need help, they can just ask one of their friends through the computer. Students would better understand the content they are @CAPS6 and when they go to school, they would already know it. Therefore, computers would lead to students getting better grades. Computers play a big role in society today. They are a way of communication, @CAPS6, and allows students to do better in school. Overall, computers are a very beneficial tool in our society."	4	6		10																					
1034	1	"I support advances in technology because In the future. Our world will be run by computers people can learn about places and people that they can never afford to see for real, and lastly, this helps to connect people to other people without talking to them directly. Have you ever thoughtabout the future, I know I have, usually when you think future, you think nobody and lots of automated things. The fact is the world is turning into a pure run by technology and as we the people get smarter, so does the technology so what good will the future if none of us know how to work a simple peice of technology such as a computer, then how are we going to use the more complicated things then? Believe it or not our world within @NUM1 years will be run all on computers, you will not have to do antyihg but wil them. without computers, how would we know aobut all of the stuff that we know now. How would people know that egypt looked like @NUM2 year ago? they dont to be there they could just look it up on the computer and how just as must about it as if they went there. Also computers enable you to learn about people that lived before your time. What president that you in something aobut how would you be able to find out after computer you could go to a library is right there to be will out computers in todya society. Our average being would in at how does becaus of the that computers have given us. I can whey some experts are conceried that are however, for some people this is the only correction to their emily and friends it there is a family that lives lets say in a different country, and he or she wanted to talk to you, how would you go about doing that? I know that I would try to contact them on the computer. I love friends that live out of state and I enjoy talking to them so if we did not have the compuers that we do. these experts are sasying that we are going to drive across the country to talk to them, if you ask me htat is pretty tire consuming and pointless. In conclusion, I hope that you agree with me in keeping technology in our lives is important because of the future for people to learn nee things about places and people, and also to communicate with friends and family although I can se your part of view that kids are not getting enough exercise most kids that computers are also involved sport."	4	4		8

1042	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I took a poll of @NUM1 people and @PERCENT1 of them agree computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can help people talk to someone in a far away place, teach people hand-eye coordination, and give the ability to learn about people or places. Using computers is a great way to keep in touch with someone. For example, my grandparents live in @LOCATION2. Some of the ways I keep in touch with them are e-mailing, video chating, and instant messaging. Some other good things about talking to people online is if you're talking to many people at once or if your parents are on the phone. Another good thing about computers is they are good at teaching people hand-eye coordination. The ways of teaching this are typing, and clicking on something, @CAPS1 people, when they type, look at the keyboard. But, with pratice, they will advance to looking at the computer screen while typing. To click on something, you need to move the mouse while still looking at the screen. That, believe it or not, is hand-eye coordination. One last reason computers are good at helping people is it a student needs to look up a place or person for a school report, they can very easily go to google.com and type in who or what they are looking for. Another option is , say someone is going on a vacition to @LOCATION1 and they know nothing about it. They can go on the internet and get information on @LOCATION1 with just a couple clicks of the mouse. Finally, say someone wants to learn about @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 for fun: They type @ORGANIZATION2 in look at all the websites, choose the best one, and start reading. In conclusion, I deffinately think computers have a positive effect on people for the reasons I have stated. People can talk to someone online, computers can teach hand-eye coordination, and finially, people can look a person or place up using the internet. This is my opinion on computers, I hope you agree."	4	4		8																					
1049	1	"Dear edditer of my local newspaper In my opinion computers have a positive effect on people. I support the advances in technology. I believe @CAPS1 is a positive thing because @CAPS1 teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people, and even allows us to talk online with others. In the following poragraphs I will share with you my opinions and why they are the right opinions for all to believe in. Firstly hand-eye coordination plays a big part in our lives, many of us do sports. Now sports isn't just about being the best @CAPS1's about getting better and doing your best. Sports take alot of practice, and are way is computer games though I bet you didn't know @CAPS1, these games help you develope hand-eye coordination. Defeating these monsters and such really helps you in sports. Catching and throwing is a big part in alot of sports and thats all hand-eye coordination, and where do you think you get @CAPS1 from practice and computer games. So next time your on the computer play som games and that will be like practicing for sports and will help you devolop the hand-eye coordination you need to suceed in a sport. Secondly, @CAPS2 in favor for computer use is because @CAPS1 gives us the oppurtunity to learn about places and people from all around the world. Think about @CAPS1 before computers if you want to know something you might have to locate all around for a book that tells you @CAPS1, @CAPS1 could take, now you type what you want to know or google and bing theres your answer. This ability to quickly find what your looking for allows you more freedom to learn and spend other precious time doing other things you want to do then take the to locate and read the right book. As you can see this is a ability and can be a big help when you need to know something fast. So help you yourself and use computers make life easyer. Thirdly computers are a way to communicate they can let you talk to people all around the, when you might and usaly be able do. This is a great way to stay in contact wen people move, go away on a buisness trip go on vacation, or even to meet new people. Say you cany get a hold of someone because there phone is off and its important you talk to them you could email them or if there online and ahave @CAPS3.M. you could @CAPS2(instant message) them. This would save you the hessle of having to keep calling him. Also if you want to see what there doing or where they are you could us a webcome and see them instead of just talking to them. As this paragraph shows internet and computers open more then ever before. As the I wrote above, I showed not even a fraction of what computers are good for. My reasons for computers being more of positive thing, ever a negitive thing are as followed; they help us with learning things that before we couldn't, communicate with others, and help us develope hand eye coordination. I can only hope that as I write my conclusion, ""that my opinions were heard and that this letter has helped all see why computers are a great thing, not a bad one."	5	5		10																					
1052	1	"Did you know that @PERCENT2 out of @PERCENT1 children today, prefer to play games on the computer than do other activities? My opinion about this topic is that it is more important for children to do things other than sit on the computer all day. The reasons why I feel this way is because it is important to exercise, children tend to be addicted to playing on the computer, and if someone's life revolves around the computer than they most likely, won't be able to live on the ""real world"". When a child sits at the computer all day, they are not getting exercise. Today, obesity is a major problem. If people stay on the computer less and exercise more than this situation could decrease. Also, it is important for children to get fresh air. When someone plays on the computer they are not getting as much fresh air as you would outdoors. Lastly, who realize the importance of exercise tend to participate in sports, to stay active and have fun. Once you begin to play games on the computer, there is not turning back. In today's society, children of all ages, become addicted to the computer. Children who are addicted pay no attention to their surroundings. Also, some of these games might be inappropriate for younger players. Lastly, if children become addicted, they could do poorly in school for refusing to do homework. If a child is constantly on the computer than they have a chance of not being prepared for the ""real world."" In the ""real world,"" you can't rely on computer games. Also, games won't teach you things that you can only learn during school. Later in life, when you want to get a job, you won't be able to be accepted because you will not sound knowledgable. Lastly, when you are writing your application to go to a college, they will look at your records of sports and activities you've done in middle school. When they don't find anything, they will reject you because of your lack of participation. So when you are sitting at the computer screen, remember all the possibilities you have other than the computer. For example, it is important for you to exercise, playing games on the computer could make you addicted and you won't be prepared for te ""real world"". What is your opinion?"	4	5		9																					
1053	1	"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1 and I believe that computers have a negative influence on people. When people are on computers all day they have less time exercising. They are in alot more danger, and they spend less time with there family. These are my only some reasons why computers dontbenefit society.. In more, more time spent on computers equals less time exercising. With the obesity rate rising no one wants to be unable to do regular activitys. With spending all your time on the computer, you would just be using to get over weight and unhealthy. It also makes many people feel self consiou about themselves. If they dont have enough time exercising and keep eating they will become even more self consious. More over it will bring more danger to you and your family. There are many places on the internet where you can meet new people. But how do you know if people are who they seem to be? If you spend more time on the computer then you will increase your chances by @PERCENT3 to get a personal assuts, or even give you personal information up. So why should you take the risk? Just get off that computer! Even if you dont meet on internet assuter you will still be glued to your computer cauzing it more likley to be harrased. I definatly dont want that for my family. The last reason is the most important to @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 family. If you are spending all this time on your computer you will be out on in your family. This time is verry important because you never know when your family will be gone! And it is a verry scarry topic to think about. I know that most people in @LOCATION1 was spend all the time with there family. On another note a survey shows that @PERCENT2 of children that spend time with there family and less than @NUM1 minutes on the computer have grades higher than @NUM2 in all classes. Wouldn't you want to make the honnor role in your school? In conclusion, computers have a negiteve effect on people! Spending most time on your computer can causes less time spent exercising, more danger/harm to people, and less time spent with your family. Wouldn't you just rather spend less time on your computer? Thank you for your time."	4	5		9																					
1055	1	"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, To many people it is so much fun but then they become so obsessed that they can lose so much that they loved. My stand is that computers hurt peoples. Money, weight and sleep. My opinion is my opinion but I will stand strong with what I have. My father is favorite is the financial deal. With five kids and one laptop who would want to be happy. With people sitting and staring at a computer game all day the bills just keep billing up until you lose everything, such as your house, family, money, ect. But who cares about them when you are obsessed with your computer. My favorite is the overweight problem. Yeah I agree it is nice to sit in a soft cushy chair with your computer and bowls of chips and boxes of pizza but sooner or later all that fatty food will catch up to you when you least expect it but will you get up and take a jog, run on a treadmill or go for a @NUM1 walk. Probably not will that computer game running. That wright will keep coming until you can't even move. Sitting at a @NUM2 will really have your eyes, brain, muscles and other important bodyparts due to lack of sleep and want for it. I can relate this to my brother with his dis. The be gets home, boom he is on it until maybe @NUM3 or @NUM4 o'clock in the @TIME1. Eventually he is going to get sick and I'm not to blame for it. When you sit at a computer than eventually you are going to make yourself sick and in some cases die if you were up that late. Now as a common teen to love to go on the computer but one thing I do not do is sit and watch movies or play games every hour of every day. I get outside and run so that I will not fall victim to weight. Financial, and body problems, like @MONTH1 people do. So don't waste your life on a game or chat room get out there and do something like sports or just get some fresh air."	4	4		8																					
1059	1	"I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because they teach hand-eye codination, also give people the ability to and lastly they allow people to talk online. First, they teach hand eye codination and I think thats good because when people get a job they can probably more focused and can probably work faster. So if people can do that when they get a job and their jobs involve working on a computer it can be easier for them and their job can be more enjoyable. Second they give people the ability to learn more because we have all these sites that involve information an everything so people can be more knowledge so if they're more knowledged they can probably get a really good job that pays alot. And they can look up whatever they like. So if they reasearch alot and go to school they can get the job they always wanted because they know so much knowledged people are better people. Lastly they can talk to online people when people can contact each other its better because if they have no phone to reach someone they need to reach they got a computer that they can either email or use a webcam were they can see the person. I think that having a computer is good for all these reasons having hand eye cordination give people the ability to learn more and allow people to talk online with other people."	4	4		8																					
1064	1	"Did you know that the positive effects computers have on people the negative? I believe that the usige of computers increases one's knowledge of faraway places safety can be used for communication and can make everyday task easier computers have become the tools of society. Firstly, using computer allow a floridian to learn about connecticutions; or a canadian to learn about the world around them. safely. In a by the @ORGANIZATION1, it has been shown that without the computer, @PERCENT1 of all people would have been ignorant of the one-child dilemna in @LOCATION3. In addition, since the crime rate in @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 is @PERCENT2 having comilted, an american might not went to visit @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, they mush learn about it for a business project. What do they do? They venture onto the computer and and everything they need to know about @LOCATION1, from the security of their home. While people can learn about faraway places from the safety of their houses, can also the computer for communication purposes. The computer is a great tool for communicating with other people. In a done in @DATE1, @PERCENT3 of computer users had some sort of social networking or instant mesaging program. Some examples of these are @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, respectively. being able to contact people has never been easier. Did you know that out of every @NUM1 americans spend an average of a hours online everday? So truly that the average I.Q has increased in the last @NUM2 years? When online, students can receive help from fellow students, teachers, and even experts! users of the computer can get feedback from essays, support to something new, and even boost self confidence. Communication is a great utilixation of computers, as is the simplicity to perform everyday tasks online. In today's society, the computer can make everyday tasks so much easier! when I was a child, my mom spend hours in the local grocery, shopping for food. That all changed when my mother discovered @LOCATION2. It is a safe and easy way to buy food online to then have it delivered not only, but @PERCENT4 of americans with computers have paid their taxes online. A once job has become simple, with the mere click of a button it is nerve-wrecking that the majority of our day need not be filled with flooring errands, but what we want! Whether that be to exercise or simply enjoy nature. In a nutshen, computers are great assets to society. They have a muriad of purposes and functions. They can inrease a person's knowledge of faraway places safely, be used for communication purposes. and make everyday tasks simple. Its hard to even ruminat how we managed before this device come along."	4	5		9																					
1070	1	"I think spending a lot of time on the computer is not a good idea because @CAPS1 has bad things online. @CAPS1 makes people stupid, and @CAPS1 makes you lazy. Those are the @NUM1 reasons why you shouldn't stay on the computer all day. One of the reasons is that the computer has bad things online like kidnaps. I seen a lot of video and movies about kidnaps when an older men or women starts taking to some young kids and they go meet some place and the young teen or kid never comes back. Another reason is that the computer makes you stupid for example when I use to be on the computer all day I would get out to get something to eat and some times I would go in the bathroom to get food and then I notice that thats not the kochen @CAPS1 feels like I just woke up when I got off. My last reson is that computer makes you lazy. The computer makes you lazy because you just stay in the computer all the time sitting on the chair without sun light or exercise @CAPS1 will make you want to stay here more and its not good for you mind and body. These are my three reasons why you should not stay on the computer, the more you the more you will want to stay. So don't stay on the computer because there is bad things in there, @CAPS1 will make you lazy. Please don't stay on the computer for a long time."	4	3		7																					
1075	1	"Dear readers, I right to you today about the effects of computer usage. I feel that there are some positive and some negative effects from using the computer. You can talk to people, and you can get work done, but if you are at this to much you'll be starting to gain bad health and miss other things in life. Throughout the computer, there is many ways to communicate with others, which is an amazing thing. Whether it be through a game, typing or real chatting, it's very important to talk to people and this makes things much easier than going out nad talking to people face to face. For, example penpals, over the years people have written letters to their penpals, but know you can send it over mail and email doesn't cost any money, just type up your letter click a button and done. Another positive point about computers is that you're able to get work done on it. From work for a business to school work, it doesn't matter. You bear of people using computers to do work all of the time. Why do you think there are computer labs at school or desks with computers in offices. Computers have become advanced and the easiest thing to get things done with. Presentations, essays, graphs, anything. A concern I have of the computer is that people are becoming to addicted to computers. Many younger people are overusing computers wich leads to bad health. When people sit in front of a computer screen all day only getting up to grab something to eat, people will because obese. To stall healthy people need to be outside and exercise. We need to make rules to keep people out in the open out to give the generation a healthy life. So, I have mixed feelings about computers. They can be amazing for a while but only for a while. And if you can't see this open your eyes"	4	4		8																					
1078	1	"Dear @CAPS1: you recently posed a question in you Newspaper. The @CAPS2 yourk @CAPS3, asking if the readers were for or against technology. I support computers because they give one opportunity to learn about different people all over the world and their culture, they save massive ammounts of time in today's hustle-bustle society, and you can talk to people online via certain computer programs. With a computer one can learn scores of information about foreign countries and their culture. I read an article in the @CAPS4 @CAPS3 about a man who was participating in a church program in which a foreign citizan would come to @LOCATION2 for a while to make friends and learn about the @LOCATION1. This man, @PERSON1, was assigned a from the farms of @CAPS6 who had never been out of the fields. @PERSON1 thought @CAPS13 would be nice to welcome her in his house with a familiar setting. Unfortunatley, he knew nothing about @CAPS6. he did have a computer though which he quickly retreated to so he could learn everything about her home. When the woman stepped into his door, @CAPS8 was eastastic to feel like @CAPS8 was home again. @CAPS8 ended up staying with @PERSON1 and getting married. If he had not charmed her with his knowledge from the computer. @CAPS8 might not have stayed and had a wonderful life with him. Also, @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION2 says that language students such as spanish and french have @PERCENT1 higher success rate if they have a computer to learn more about the countries. He says the average grade for kids with a computer is an A. but the average grade for kids @CAPS15 a computer is a @CAPS9+. Therefore, having a computer to learn about faraway places and people can ensure happiness and succes in the future. Computer also save a massive ammount of time. In the school Newspaper, @PERSON6 told about her homework problem. ""@CAPS10 night i had @CAPS11 homework. I had vocals @CAPS8 is a galore to deal with. I had to look up @CAPS10 word in the huge dictionary, I was failing @CAPS11 because i just didn't have the time for my homework! Then my family bought me a computer, @CAPS13 was so nice using the online dictionary. I could finish my homework in @NUM1 minutes compared to @NUM2 hours! I was finally doing well in @CAPS11."" @CAPS15 her computer, @PERSON6 would have to have and @CAPS11 @NUM2. @CAPS8 would have just kept failing @CAPS15 her time-saving computer. ALso, @PERSON3 says that @PERCENT2 of people get to work faster when they look up traffic reports on the computer instead of listening in the radio. He says that @PERCENT3 of people get a because their boss is so impressed with their consistent timing. As you can see, time is a valuable thing which computers can help save. Finally, computer allow one to talk online. A student once had the misfortune to break one of his vertabrae. The doctor told him that he would not be able to participate in school for a. The student, @PERSON5, came up with a plan to speak to his teachers via his laptop and webcam. Everyday, the teachers would give @PERSON5 an update over his computer. When he finally marched back into school, @PERSON5 barely had any work to make up because his teacher bad interacted with him over the computer. @CAPS15 his computer, @PERSON5 would have a month's worth of work and learning to make up which would have been overwhelming. Also, @PERSON4 of @ORGANIZATION1 says that students that communicate with their families during college have better relationshops after college. Obviously, being able to talk to some are over the computer is a useful thing to have. In conclusion, having a family computer is a very good thing. Not only does @CAPS13 allow people to learn about places other than their home, @CAPS13 also gives us more time and allow us to talk to other withour ever leaving the comfort on home. I recommend that everyone who wants an easier life should invest in a computer."	6	6		12																					
1080	1	"People are asking me, ""@CAPS1 you think we should spend more or less time on computers""? I say we should spend less time on the computer because children spend to much time on online games. Second kids and adults spend to much time on myspace, facebook, msm, and even aim. My third reason is children should be outside playing and exercising. These are my three reasons why we should spend less time on computers. My first reason we should all spend less time on computer is children play so many online games, such as @CAPS2 of warcraft, @CAPS3, soilder front, ect. A problem with kids playing these games become addicted to them, and will play for hours. Children should be outside getting bigger muscle, getting strong bones. Kids keep playing these games and are ruining their lifes. This is my first reason why we should spend less time on the computer. My second reason why we should spend less time on computers is children and adults spend to much time on the following: myspace, facebook, twitter, aim, msm, ect. These online pages causes people to go on one to connect to their friends. Also with these online pages they cause to much and could lead to fight or rumors. About @PERCENT1 of kids and adults go on these online pages every day its time they stayed going on their computer more time on outside or hangout with their friends. My last but not the least reason is kids should be outside playing instead of being on the computer. Children should go outside with their friend and play sport or games, something that doesn't involve with the computer. This is my third reason why children should not we spending more time on computers. As I said before people should spend less time on computer. Kids spend to much time on online games. Adults and kids spend to much time on online pages. And last children should be playing outside. Its time we put a timer on our computer and spend more time outside."	4	4		8																					
1091	1	"Dear editor of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, People say that technology is affecting everybody left and right. Computers actively help us with our daily lives. It helps us do project for school, let us understand culture around the world, and gives us the ability to talk and connect with friends and family everywhere. Our shool makes us do tons of project and the computer is our main course. If you want to go somewhere far away, you're most likely to research it, and then plan on going. It is also might be used to talk with friends on facebook, twitter, and @CAPS3. Computers help us learn and communicate. To start off, as an eight grades, we are prepared to go to high school. Fortunately, it means we do projects, reports, and research on the computer. The computer enables us to find information for a project, or construct a diagram or data table for a survey. Many people use this method for jobs. People do reports on celebrities and famous people from history. Books can't always give the information you are looking for, so they look up that persons name, and they will find our hundred of web sites that give information and photographs of that person. In addition to, computers let you book flights, buy, tax rates. Sometimes, people don't always to go and drive to a local car, so they go online to a website that sells, and they are able to look at all of the features of the car, the price, and mileage. The only way you can get tickets is if you go onto the internet. They have websites that let book whatever kind of flights you want. It can be to go to florida, or it can be a flight to @LOCATION1. If you also how the economy is doing, you can look up tax rates and how find out how much our country is in debt. You can even find out how much an average family pays - every year. Computers can be very they resourceful at @CAPS2. It gives capability to do more than you can imagine. Most importantly, computers have created a way for you talk to friends and family around the globe. Facebook and twitter are the new things of the century. Facebook and twitter let you talk to friends, post photos and talk about your personal life. They have a new thing now where you can play lifestyle games. @CAPS3 is not as popular anymore and doesn't have as many cool things. It only let's you talk to friends and that's why no one uses it anymore. People want to be able to do more than just talk. It comes to my attention that computers have over time. Computers these days enable you to talk with friends, do research and projects, and let you book flights and buy cars. Our school's curriculum has many projects and reports. They can be done only by the help of a computer. You can research people and places and or get pictures. You can also book flights for far away trips and buy cars and other items off the internet. We even have the capability to talk with friends on facebook and twitter. Computers have a positive influence on people."	5	5		10																					
1098	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 are several reason how computers have effect on people. My position is to convice the local newspaper why certain people @CAPS2't and @CAPS3 use computers. People getting caught up on the @CAPS4, or people not having enough money to explore the world, so they just be on the @CAPS4. In effect, people @CAPS2't waste their time on the @CAPS4 because you will get caught up. For example, my friend @PERSON1 stay on the computer more than @NUM1 hours. He tells me that his on a @CAPS5 line, hooking up with other people. He for gets about everybody. He's so on the @CAPS4. He stop going school, he gaining. Now he just a nobody. He just sit in front of his computer and do nothing. I feel like he just threw his life away just for some stupid @CAPS5 line. @CAPS8's not hard to find another in our city. @CAPS8's alot of beautiful young lady's out here to explore. Similary, people @CAPS2't waste their time on the @CAPS4 because you start losing time. For instance, you spend less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. People stop losing their focus on important, and start paying attention on other things like the, was a great person. She was so successful. She make tons of money. Until she start losing her her job. She stop cause she was so stock on facebook. Facebook is like a place for a friend @CAPS6 you could meet other people from different @CAPS7 you could just find people to date on that website. Facebook turn her life around. I remember her telling my mom how her life is so mess up now. How she got fired, how she don't pay her bill, and how she moving into a. Sometimes websites make lose focus on important thing in life. Consequently, certain people @CAPS3 use computer because the @CAPS4 help you with certain things. In summation, @CAPS8 help you find hotel or trip to go on with your friends or families. I love being on the @CAPS4. One time I sign up for this website that was called myspace. For moment I did got caught up on @CAPS8. Continue line."	4	5		9																					
1099	1	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects that computers have on people is that more and more obese people. People tend to get moody. and it seems that computers are addictive. I think computers have a huge effect on people. The nubmer one thing is that more people every year are becoming obese because they do not leave the chair they sit inside for most of the day. Also they get so lazy they don't want to get up so they will just order food and have it delivered right to their hause. The next idea is that they do not get enought exersise, because they isn't sit there all day and don't move. But when they do move its to get something to eat or go get their phone. This is why they should limit kids and adults to only @NUM1 hours or less of computer time each day. @CAPS1 next reason is because people that are on computers tend to get . Like one second they are happy and once they get off the computer they are sad. They get all couped up inside for the whole day. They don't see enough because people don't see they . If they hour each day the moody ness would change. People need lot of exersise to maintain weight and muscle. @CAPS1 last receson the computers have effects on people is that people will tend to act addicted to the computer . Like if they are playing a game all day and don't realize it they will get addicted and not stop playing all day. People need to leave the computer and do something else like ride a bike or play a sport. In conclusion what I am trying to tell you taht it is not good that people stay inside all day and play on the computer, because it is hazardous to your health and it is putting you at a hgih risk of obesity. So can you please listen to @CAPS1 ideas."	4	4		8																					
1102	1	"Dear local newspaper, I think that the computer is not a bad thing becase of three resons one reson is that we can learn a bought a faraway place. Another reson is they teach hand-eye coordination. The last reson is we can talk to frteinds and meet new people. From the computer we can learn a bought a faraway place if we were doing a report on it or just our of curiosity. We can learn wat kind of plantation grow there for food for example tropical places grow bananas and cocanuts. We can learn wat they eat like in @LOCATION1 they eat many beans a lot of there food have beans even there salads. We can find out there language as well maybe they talk spanish like in @LOCATION2. You can also teach hand-eye coordination becase it involves using your fingers and eyes to see what you are typing. You use ur hands on evry thing while typing wether you are typing or you are using the mouse. But it is not just for learning things it is also for freinds becase of al these sites like myspace, facebook, aim, webchat. The posibilities are endless u can even play games. If you dont know someone on face, book, or myspace thats okay it is a great way to meet new people and new freinds. And another thing if u are having trouble findin freind you can just see if they are online. It is good for getting together somwhere or something. And for those pepole who think it is taking away family time you can always just say okay thats enough and talk to them. So that is it they are good because u can learn of places, hand-eye coordination, and talk to new and old freinds. so they are good"	4	4		8																					
1113	1	"Click, click, click the mouse of a computer goes as you are searhcing throughout the internet. Computers are a great way to teach kids how to be social, make people more intellegent, and help you with your homework, I believe that computers have a very positivr effect on people. Computers can touch kids to be social because first off computers are like an online phone, you can talk to people in so many ways, facebook caht, aim(chat),, myspace, twitter, skype, and a lot of others ways that i havent mentioned. Also I think is a teen or kid or even adult that is too nervous to talk to people on the phone or in person, and is socialy not their or painfully shy can start of by just chatting with people online. Once they feels more comfoatable, then they can start talking to the person on the phone or in person. For example, I once @MONTH1 this girl who was very sweet, but was painfully shy and everyone for it, so one day she decided to make an aim nad talk to poeple on it, and provove that she isn'e a annoying wherd girl that everyone makes her out to be. She turned out to be one of the nicestly funniest person I ahve hung out with in a while. Which how internet can help you. HAve you ever felt that computers sometimes make you more intellegent? Well, in my opinion I think that computers help out so much more than a book. If you want information its just about typing some keys and a click of a button. Ahving a computer is like your own personal handbook of veerything in the world. A lot of people these days study from the internet, I know I sure do. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 more people say, that computers are more helpful than books and can make you a lot more intellegent, because the internet has so much more deatil than books, and mor efacts. @PERCENT2 of kids that have a computer use it for homewrok. Computers is a great tool to use while you are doing your homework. I spend most of the day on my computer doing homework than off it. For example, say you have a report and you need facts on @CAPS1 @PERSON1, and where he was born. You would jus type in, ""when was @ORGANIZATION1 boen."" and born! There it is with the date exactly. Also if you having a piece of writing like your rough draft so why spend the time trying to write really neat and perfect? When you can just open up a word document and type it up. To sum everything up computers have deffenatly a positive effect on people from these three reasons, computers are a great way to teach kids hohw to be social, make people more intellegent, and help you with your homework, But I understand where your coming from people are spending way to much time on their computer and less time exersising, but you can look up great ways to exersise on the internet and watch videos of people that have @CAPS2.V shows about exersising and do it with them on the computer. Remember, computers aren'@CAPS2 just a waste of time and way to will your brain cells. they have a very positive effect on you. "	5	5		10																					
1114	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am here to prosoade you to agree with me on, that the use of computers does benift society. Some reasons why I think this are school work and business stuff. Also the over all reasearch on important things. My first reason why I think that computer use is benifiting society is because @CAPS6 is oftenly used for school work. In example use @CAPS6 for projects. Also some type of reasearch they might be interested in. But one of the most important reasons why computers use is so high is because, there are a lot of people taking online classes. Wheather its for college or for the sake of your own learning. This is why I think school work shoud be a valid reason for benifiting society. My second reason why I think @CAPS6 benifits our society is the business or job part of the computer. Many people, @CAPS7 a days work at home, they have their own office. They all most create their own company. Another reason is many people also use ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" or publisher. @PERCENT1 of the people who work at public businesses do this, going along with ads, when could also or another reason for this. But then again, you could @CAPS7 pay your bills on line! I remember when I helped my mother pay on of the bills online, and let me tell you, ""@CAPS6 was easy!"". My mother said she do @CAPS6 more often @CAPS7 that she knows how to use @CAPS6!"" @CAPS7 the business side should be more then enough, for me to convince you. My last reason is over all reasearch on all important things. Some of these important things are: online catalogs, the news and another one the most important things of all job openings. I know my self, and I love to shop! So instead of leaving the house, I just go on the online catalog to my favorite store called ""@CAPS8"". The main reasons why I go online is b/c they have more variety and sizes. @CAPS7 for the news, thats all for my parents b/c i don't watch the news. Lastly, job openings @CAPS7 that I am @NUM1, I would like to find a job, even if its mimumum wage. @CAPS6's still something, right? This should be a high priced reason for agreement! In @CAPS9, I think my @NUM2 reason are very well clear; school work, business, and over all reasearch. If these reasons don't convince you I dont know what will!?"	5	5		10																					
1123	1	Many computers that people have they use it everday right? Most of them be on it from the time they get off of work or out of school until it's time for them to go to bed. What I think they should to is find some other activity to do instead of sitting on the computer for six hours and not doing nothing with their life and plus at that when you look at a computer for so long you can mess up you eye sight. Why be on the computer all day when you can go outside and get some fresh aire? Why would you wanna be on the computer when you have family and some friends you could be spending time with and taken care of? You don't want to be lazy and not do nothing for yourself. You wanna be able to go for a walk instead of being cooped up in the house on the computer. Why would you even wanna be on the computer when you could have fun going out to eat or to an place you always have wanted to go your whole entire life? You can't always depend on a computer when you wanna go out and explore something new you have to try it out yourself to really see whats the whole thing about. You don't want to have a boring life now do you? Cause that's what it seems like by you sitting around on the computer everyday looking of a bunch of @NUM1-since you wanna do what you want to do and have fun by doing what you like to do. It's not easy finding a job or planing to go out far away by looking on the computer because you have to click a lot of numbers or pictures to go threw what you wanna get to when you can go and do it yourself by looking for better and other things to do.	3	3		6																					
1141	1	"Dear @CAPS1, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology belive that computers have a positive affect on people like me. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, they even allow people to talk online with other people. I will tell you why we should benifit these computers. The first reason is computers teach hand-eye coordination. You can learn how to type really fast. Without hand-eye cordinatoin how are you supose to hit a ball coming at you with a bat, how are you supose to catch a ball with your hands? The second reason is you can learn about far away places and people. Like how we are in the @LOCATION1 and we want to learn about @LOCATION3 or say that we are in france and we want to know about the german people are look it up we dont go all the way down there jest to see the german people we look it up. Now think about it you jest going to fly there and come back the same day. The last thing is you can talk online to anybody you want from africa to the us all the way to @LOCATION2. So you see computers are really speacial becus you see you dont want to write someone amillion things it is not right so we need computers."	3	3		6																					
1154	1	"Dear Readers, I understand that some @MONTH1 think computers can effect peoples' lives. This is because it causes them to not go outside excersising and enjoying nature. My point of view is that people have the choice to go out side, exercise, and enjoy nature. Computers give so much information that it could give people ideas of fifferent activities people can do outdoors. Computers also have abilities to download videos and other soft ware that people can look at and perform excersing with them, and learn techniques. In my life my mom and dad, and many other people im my family, look online at different websites to see what activities we can do on the weekends and seasonal activities. Computers are very important and are life changing. If it wasn't for computers some people wouldn't be able to get an education. Doctors, police officers, and banks use computers for thier job and it helps us go through are everyday lives with ease. From what i see and understand i that computers have a positive effect on our lives. Computers can be negative but it all has to do with self control and how you use it."	4	4		8																					
1155	1	"Computers are becoming more advanced everyday, almost everyone owned, or owns a computer. I think, ther benefit society very greatly. One of the many ways is, they teach you hand eye coordination. So even @CAPS1 your playing games your hand-eye coordination @MONTH1 be improving. With hand-eye coordination you @MONTH1 need it to play sports like baseball. When do you need hand-eye coordination the most? I use it most, when I'm playing hockey or, baseball. So next time your on a computer, remember your hand-eye coordination is improving. Another reason we benefit from having computers, is we learn about far away places. @CAPS1, you know about places that are far away from you that you can or can't travel to, use a computer to gain some background knowledge @CAPS1 you travel somewhere on business and know nothing about it, what do you do? I know! get on a computer and do some research about it! An example of this is, @CAPS1 you have to fly out to @LOCATION1 and don't know anythin about it, use a laptop on the way over there. @CAPS1 you do that, you'll have some schema about the place. As you can see laptops and computers are great for learning of foreign countries. Finally, computers are great for learning a new language. You need to learn spanish in a couple of weeks. What will you do? Download a free language learning app. @CAPS1 you don't know a lot of french and need a few words but don't have a dictionary. Use a translator. When you are talking to someone from @LOCATION1 and you don't know there language use an english to african dictionary translation app on your computer. Computers have a great translater applications that are free so, @CAPS1 you don't know a language hop on a computer and learn it! In conclusion, computers are used every day and help us greatly, weather it be learning a new language, or just talking to friends. Computer benefit society greatly."	4	4		8																					
1159	1	"In a study conducted by @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are spending more that @NUM3 hours a day on the computer. ""@CAPS1 computers became so popular here has been an increase in social problems, health issues and pollution,"" says @PERSON1. The question is then, do computers really benefit society or do they have a negative affect on people? I strongly believe that these computers are badly affecting us. First, less people are spending time outside enjoying nature. Imagine, sitting outside under the brilliant fall sun as leaves of red, yellow, and green dance with the wind. How will anyone see the beautiful sights of the outside world if their eyes are glued to the computer screen? Eight out of ten @CAPS2 surveyed by the national nature @CAPS3 admit to not going outside on sunny days but instead play on the computer. ""The more people who see how beautiful is the less likely they will pollute it with smoke. Dr @PERSON2. How is our country supposed to be clean if people want even turn off the computer the @NUM4 hour a day and see the world? In conclusion, computers have a negative affect on person because they seeing beauty. Second, computers take up so much time that people are with their families. I used to think that talking with someone. Now, I've realized that talking in real life with people is better. I remember meeting the girl. She woulod always talk with email texting of instant messaging. Seventy-nine percent of families split up due to social problems. All smart, intelligent people talks about families or just car and around, these sucessful people know the key to happiness is communication and are working to help get rid of computers. Lastly, more time on computers means less exercise. Teenagers are supposed to get one hour of exercise each day but @NUM5 out @NUM2 teens surveyed at @ORGANIZATION2 admit getting that exercise. There has been a @PERCENT1 increase in a obesity in children from @DATE1 when computers weren't big. Now almost @NUM4/2 of boys in @NUM8 grade at @ORGANIZATION2 agree to spending too much time on computers. In conclusion computers take away some important things line exercise. Come on now-can't we agree that computers have a negative offers ? our poor environment is getting killed because no one sees the beauty of families are seeing occupy their lives most a lot up and sight against computers today! It will be the best choice you ever make."	6	6		12																					
1164	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I am aware of the current debate about technology, however more spacificly computers. Computers are a helpful interesting & even fun peace of technology. Computers open the world to new people & places & limmiting that is uncalled for. Computers are keys to inavation & creation. When @ORGANIZATION1 did a study on the use of computers @PERCENT1 of people said they got their news files & even planned threw the computer & now @PERCENT2 of creations are being done through the computer. This illustrates the power of computers allowing people to do things that were once impossible. Now humans are capable of spreading info around the world in seconds. Computers also business grow through advertisment or work softwares. Computers are the key to help open the world to new possabilities & options not possible @NUM1 years ago. I understand my oposition is not only against computers but wants to limit there use. That is unfair & possibly unconstitutional. They argue that people exercise less due to computers, however @PERCENT3 of people, when asked has computers negativly impacted your exercise said ""no"" & one man stated ""because of computers I learned new workouts & even found a great local trainer."" @CAPS2 you can understand computers are not just about games & toys, but allowing people to grow & learn more to help them find plasas to travel & assist in their exercise. Computers are a wonderful tool when it comes to communication.

1165	1	"Dear @PERSON1 @CAPS1 I am writing this letter to inform you that I think computers are a smart investment for a couple of reasons. The following are some reasons on why computers benifit society, they allow children to do homework with some help, children can talk to other friend and when children are board they can play games music on it. UGH! I don't get this sometimes I am sitting at the kitchen table tring to do my history homework but I don't know the year the revalotionary war was. @CAPS2 I go in my room turn the computer on and @CAPS6 there I go to google and look up what I need to know. This also benefits parents too because if they are doing the bills or something they don't have to be bothere, the kid could look it up and know it is @CAPS6! Finally all my homework is done but my computer is still on I'm going to see who is online that I can talk to and make sure I didn't miss any homework. Talking to your friends online could help you stay in contact with friends in other states or just people you don't see very often. This can help make new friends or make friendships closer and cause less problems. Alright no body is home or online @CAPS2 I think @CAPS3 going to kick back turn some music to kick back turn some music on and maybe take a nap. Or I can play the new counter strke game I got ! YEAH on playing counter strike. Least death on my team that game! Alright thats enough of counter strike for the day I think I'm going to turn same music on and lay in bed.

1168	1	"Dear, newspaper writer I think the computer has a posative effect of people because @CAPS1 helps people around the world learn to speak a different language, @CAPS1 helps people talk to their friends around the world and @CAPS1 helps people by making @CAPS1 easier to write a letter and send @CAPS1 out to people they work for or to their bosses that need the report in by the end of the day. Those are the three reason that computers have a posative effect. @CAPS1 helps people learn to speak a different language without spending a lot of money like using rosetta stone you have to spend @NUM1 us dollars but online you dont have to spend a dime. the best part is that @CAPS1 is free. The slogan for rosetta stone is ""I have spent less money than months of formal classes."" I think their new slogan should be is "" we have a better learning company than anyone else."" That is why @CAPS1 helps people learn a different language. @CAPS1 also helps people by making @CAPS1 easier to talk to their friends you can aim, web cast, and ever text to make @CAPS1 easier @CAPS1 talk to friends on the internet. The reason they created that is so people dont have to travel to far away places and spend money to tell a friend important news that is only one thing. So in conclusion you dont have to spend a lot of money to tell a friend something. The third reason that the computer helps people is that people san e mail theor boss that they are faxing their final repoet to the big interview for a new position in the place where they work, @CAPS1 helps your boss by making @CAPS1 easier to read and @CAPS1 better because you could be in japan and your boss could be in florida @CAPS1 will take like @NUM2 minutes to get to your bosses computer. That is why @CAPS1 is easier to send messages to your boss. The three main reasons are that you can learn a different language without paying a dime that you can talk to your friends easier and that you can send messages to your boss easier that calling him or her. Those are the three reasons that computers are posative."	4	4		8																					
1179	1	I believe that people spending to much time on computers can effect their health and the relationship they have with friends and family. If you are on the computer and one of your friends ask you to go outside you are most likely to say no because the computer is grabing your attention more than going outside. That hurts your health and your relationship with your friend. If your family is going to a movie to have family time maybe you will stay because you would stay home on the computer. That effects the relationship with your family. Most people rather stay on the computer than spend time working out. So that effects your health because most of the time your on the computer for a long time your going to end up hungry and keep eating and eating and since your not working out you get fat. Now your not working out and you just keep eating. So since you are not working out and your mind is always on the computer you can get sick. Thats why most people are not healthy because of computers. Computers can mess up your relationships with family and friends. Sometimes your friend can ask you to go outside or to work out and you say no because your on the computer that messes up your relationship with your friend. Or your family can be having a movie night and your on the computer while they leave. That is messing up the relationship with your family. Being on the computer you can go nights without sleeping. I your playing a realy good game on the computer and it comes time for you to take a rest and since the game is so fun you don't sleep. Then after a while you get addicted and won't stop playing. So you won't get sleep and if you have school you won't be able to concentrate you will to busy worried about the game. So thats why computer aren't so good. It can mess up your health. I can mess up your social life with family and friends. You won't get a lot of sleep and won't be able to concentrate.	4	4		8																					
1191	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you think that children spend to much time on the computer. The issue that is going around is @CAPS2 computers have good effects on people or bad ones. I strongly believe that they have bad effects on people. I believe this because people spend more time on the computer than they @CAPS2 exerciseing. Another reason is that people argue it teaches hand eye coordination, well so does sports and just playing. My last reason is that people argue that it is some thing that helps you learn about people and far away places, but books @CAPS2 the same thing. I know alot of people feel that computer have good effects but the truth is they have bad ones. First, people spend more to on the computer than they @CAPS2 exerciseing. People rather stay inside and play games on the internet then go outside and play tag or any sport. On a talk it was said that, ""In @LOCATION1 people are alot over wieght"", and it was also said that the number of over wieght people in the world was the of @LOCATION2"". So I believe that people should get of the computer and exercise. Secondly, people think that it teaches hand eye coordination but so @CAPS2 sports. Instead of being on the computer learning hand eye. You could be out side learning hand eye coordination. Again instead of just sitting at the computer your outside running around haveing fun while you learn hand eye coordination. My last reason is, that people argue that people use it to learn about far away places and people, but they have books for that too. People rather look stuff up on the computer but as soon as they're finsh the start playing games or the computer. Also some of the information might not even be true. Because people hack sights all the time and change things but you can't hack a book. The only thing you can @CAPS2 to change it is to rip out pages and that only waste your money to a new book. So I believe that books are more reliable. Now is the time to make your disicion. @CAPS2 computers have good or bad effects. I believe that computers have bad effect on people. Other things could teach you remarkable hand eye coordination and other great sources to about other place then the computer. Most importantly people should spend more time exerciseing the they @CAPS2 on the computer. Now it time for you to go ahead and put this on the front page of your newspaper and let the whole world know. "	4	4		8																					
1194	1	"Letter to the @CAPS1 I disagree with the so-called ""experts"" that claim that computers could have negative effects on people. The idea that you socialize less with family and friends is a pathetic arguement. Social networking sites like @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 allow @CAPS22 with all your friends @CAPS4 and other online games help you met new people that could be hundreds of miles away from you! Twiter is good when you just want to say something quick like ""@CAPS5 to @LOCATION1"". @CAPS18 allows you to talk to friends, comment on their videos, and subscribe to them, plus it provides hours of entertainment without a fee. Computers also can provide fun games and entertain users. There are many free games, like @PERSON1, that have endless possibilities. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 (made by @CAPS6) claims to be the most popular @CAPS7 (@CAPS8 @CAPS9 Online @CAPS10-playing @CAPS11) on the web. You can level up combat skills: attack, defence, strength, ranged, and magic. Or you can level up skills like wood cutting, prayer, farming, fishing, mining, and cooking. @PERSON1, like most @CAPS4, has quests, with varying difficulties. For example, for one quest you have to kill a demon, but for another, just find a missing cat. There are over @NUM1 quests, and there are never fewer than @NUM2 people playing at a time. Some other notable @CAPS13 games are @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS14: @CAPS15, @CAPS16 of @CAPS17, @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION2, and @ORGANIZATION1. As you can see, the computer has an impressive list of entertaining @CAPS11 for all ages, not to mention sites like @CAPS18 or addicting games. Computers don't really affect exercising. That's a personal choice, so you have to choose between @CAPS2 or the basketball court. It's like saying that before we had computers or video @CAPS11 consoles, that a @CAPS20 board stopped kids from exercising. The computer doesn't actually stop us from exercising. It's our minds that do, and our judgement. If you have bad judgement, you'd stay inside all day tweeting and @CAPS21. With a good strong mind and willpower, you can overcome a bad decision and play sports or go to the gym. All it takes is good judgement. Just to recap what I've said, @CAPS22 is plenty on computers and there are many choices on how to do it. Many sites amuse us, and we should make use of that. Not to mention you can buy games like @CAPS16 of @CAPS17 or @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS14: @CAPS15 for your @CAPS13! Computers don't actually hinder exercising, all it takes is good judgement to get off that chair and exercise."	5	5		10																					
1195	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 having everything known to man at your fingertips. @CAPS4 having an endless source of information in your own home. Wouldn’t you want all of this all the time? The question then is, do computers have positive effects on people? I strongly believe computers do benefit society. Firstly, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. The main way is by typing. When you type, you start of looking at the keys but eventually you memorize all the locations of the keys. Also, computer games teach hand-eye coordination. If you weren't looking at the screen, would it be possible to win the game? When computers teach you hand-eye coordination, you can use it for other things too. For example, you definitely need it in sports or more. Specifically, baseball. If you didn't have good hand-eye coordination, you wouldn't be able to catch the ball or be able to hit the ball when you swing. Hand-eye coordination very important. Secondly, computers give people the ability to form about places and people. When people are deciding when to get vacation, they go in the internet. What there is in do. Why would you travel in a place is you back. Many use the internet in research other countries. When the eight grade did reports their information. Eighty seven percent the internet. Finally; some people say computers take away from interaction with family and friends, but computers actually allow you to tell with other family and friends around the world. Wouldn't it be wonderful to with your loved ones in a different state of country? The main way of online communication is @CAPS5-mail or @CAPS6 @CAPS7. These allow you to send someone a message faster and easier. It is much easier in remember someone @CAPS5-mail address than it is a phone settle for just talking, when you can actually see the person? It would be like them being in the room with you. Computers are a great way to talk to someone. Why wait any longer? Computers are a great way to refine your hand-eye coordination skills. You can research Faraway people and places to see what life is like around the globe. Most importantly, you can communicate with family and friends online through @CAPS8, @CAPS5-mail, or @CAPS10. Definitely, computers benefit society. So go and share this information with other people to convince them that computers are positive."	6	5		11																					
1197	1	"Dear, Local Newspaper I think that it would be better if people get outside to get so exercise and enjoy nature to interacte with there family and friends. If you get out with your family and friends maybe more teens and adults would be in better shape and more healthly. Say we jump out of bed, gets some breakfast and head to the park to gets an excrize with your family and friends. Alot of family and friends i think spend way to much time on the computers or there labtops because if they are on the computer to long then they will not want to go outside and get excrise with there friends. More and more people use the computer. But not everybody agrees on this statement. What I think it would be better to solve the problem and have everybody get outside and get some freshair with family and friends. But some people don't think that is the right thing to go. People that think those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Well I don't think that is the way to go because you need to get outside to get some. Freshair with people. But if you want to go on the computer you can but I think it should be only for a little bit then because some people have a bissness that they have to work on when they are at work. Sometimes people have to work on there computer every day so if that is the case they I think they should be alouded to use the labtop or computer. But if you are a teen you should only go on if you have to f you needing the internent or writeing a paper. But if you going to go on to just go on to just talk to friend then that is a waste of time in somebody life. Well at least my life it is. I think as a teen you shold be to work on studying on doing your homework instead of being on the computer because I think it would be better to make sure your grade are not making you fail in your school carvee in life. So that is why it is best to make sure you aren't on the computer all the time talking to your friends on the computer all day because it could make you fail in life. I would only go on for a little bit to talk to your friends. That is why I think it is not right to spend all your time on the computer. Jump outside and in goal the outside weather with friends and family meabers. I hope teen and adult get outside from now on because it would be better for allof us and everybody would be heathly. If they tri this program. If you tri this program it will really work to all of you tri proise it will work and you will be heathly and not feel bad about yourself."	4	4		8																					
1206	1	"Dear editor @ORGANIZATION2 the source, @CAPS1, I have noticed that many people have been spending too much time using their computers. This is something that needs to stop because it imports peoples health, safety and education. To open my statements, overuse @ORGANIZATION2 the computer con lead to poor health. Take my friend @PERSON1 for example. He sits at home on his computer all @DATE1 and plays games, goes on @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. He rarely gets any excersize and he almost never sees daylight. @PERSON1 @LOCATION1 gained @NUM1 pounds, which lead to obeisity and heart problems. He even wears wooden teeth because his general hygene declined as well. Another common health problem that developes from excessive use @ORGANIZATION2 the computer is arthrietis. Dr. @PERSON3 @ORGANIZATION2 the @ORGANIZATION1 told @ORGANIZATION3, ""The massive amounts @ORGANIZATION2 typing on the keyboard can lead to joint problems, arthrietis, and other joint related problems."" In fact, a study that took place from @DATE2 to @DATE3 to see the long lasting terms @ORGANIZATION2 computer overuse had some shocking results. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION2 the test subjects saw doctors from problems with joint pain. These health risks are a concern, but peoples safety is on bigger issue. When people excessively use the computer they put their safety and well being at risk. People have had serious injuries and scams placed on them because @ORGANIZATION2 the internet. In @DATE4, a girl named @PERSON5 was kidnapped and taken to @LOCATION2. She met a man on @CAPS4.com named @PERSON6, who persuaded her into meeting him at an airport. From their she was taken to @CAPS5 and held from ransom. Every time people use their computer, they put themselves at risk. Dr. @PERSON4 @ORGANIZATION2 the @ORGANIZATION2 claims, ""I @NUM2 @ORGANIZATION2 internet-related kidnappings & other crimes. The victim was a person who overused the computer and frequented the internet. Safety is one @ORGANIZATION2 the most important things in life. But peoples education is also effected. When people overuse the computer they can impact their education. The internet hold false information and can be a waste @ORGANIZATION2 peoples time. When students are working on a report, they very often use the internet to get information. Websites like @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION4 are most commonly used. This can be a big problem. Did you know that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION2 information on the internet is wrong? Thats more than half @ORGANIZATION2 it! The internet can also be a time waster. My bro, @PERSON2, had on assignment to do @DATE1. He stood up @NUM3 hours using @CAPS2 and didn't even write his essay. He recieved a zero on that grade. In closing, overusing your computer can cause health problems, put your safety at risk, and hurt your education."	6	5		11																					
1216	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are an extremely usefull tool in this modern age. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to easily learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with other people. Therefore, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Hand-eye coordination is a very important skill for young children to master. Without it they will have sloppy handwriting, absolutely no chance at sports, and much more. Computers help teach them because they need their finger to hit the same key that their eye sees. And because they tend to want to type faster, it will help even more because the finger and eye will have to work in mission to type faster. Computers also give people the ability to easily learn about far away places, people, etc. People used to have to spend hours searching for a half decent book on a topic, and then find the specific information they need in the hundreds of pages. Now that information is only a few clicks away. Say you have had problems with your faucet, it keeps drippy but you dont want to pay for a plumber. You could easily step by step instructions on what to do using the computer, the possibilities are endless. Finnaly, Computers can allow people to stay in contact with friends who @MONTH1 live far away. It is more convinient than using a plane because you dont have to have something in your hands the whole time. You can walk away and then came back when you hear that you got a message. It is also very usefull for people such as buisnesmen because they can talk to multiple people at once while still being able to get other work done, @PERSON1, author of buisnes magazine tells us in an iterview that it is nearly imposible to run a succesfull buisnes without a computer. How people could possibly say that computers have a negative influence on society, I dont know. But I hope that you will publish this in the paper and show them that computers are necesary."	5	4		9																					
1218	1	"There are over @NUM1 students at @ORGANIZATION2. & out of @NUM2 students have computers. Computers have a positive effect on people. Students who use computers are more skilled than kids who don't by learning all the software and hour to be safe when online. Computers teach kids hand eye coordination, which can come in handy when playing sports. Also they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Finally it allows people to talk online with other people. Computers make people develop hand eye coordination. When someone plays a sport live baseball or basketball, hand eye coordination is definetly needed. say your a catcher, and then catch it. Almost every sport needs hand eye coordination and computers help you get it. Hand-eye coordination can also be useful to people with jobs. If you work with computers for a job, it is helpful to be well known wit the keyboard for fast results. Mostly any job along with sports requires hand-eye coordination. Some people have the gift that they have hand-eye coordination when there born, but for people who don't practice is the best thing. Learning about faraway places/ people is always facinating. On computers towns can put up webpages with pictures, information or even ways to help you plan a vacation. Theres also @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 can help you find any place or you can find out anything about that place. Computers even give you the abilty to plan or visit a loc location by buying tickets online or maybe you just want to read what the place is like, you can do all that. Finally, computers can be taken any place with you and say you go to @LOCATION1, and you don't speak there language, well you can go to a translating site and figure out what things mean. Facebook, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, all of these sites make it possible for you to talk with other people. Personally, I have a facebook, aim, and even a e-mail. A lot of the time I will go on facebook and talk to my friends from school and even my cousins that I don't get see a lot. Talking online helps you interact with other people that you might not see in school or around town, and also your friends that might not have a cell phone. It helps you learn social skills that everyone needs. Computers give you all that. Its easy and free way to talk to anyone you know whenever you want. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. Almost everyone uses computers, and they aren't difficult to use. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Computers are one of the best things that has ever been made."	4	5		9																					
1221	1	"Dear @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 people believe that computors are harmful to our society because people spend more time on such technology. I believe that this is not the reason our society is falling today although I agree that people spend to much time on the computor. Computors are actually helpful in our society because it is an advance in communication. People have found ways to communicate with other people through plugging in a web cam and mic. Not only does the computor help communication but it also helps us gain information on modern day society like the news to stay up-to-date. This complicated device can also save files and documents by typing them in so that if it is lost you could just reprint it out. One main thing that people of modern day technology usually do is talk to faraway friends and family on spare time. Legal websites allow people to be informed of a friend or family about events that have ocurred like an incident or an up coming event. @CAPS2 experts like @PERSON1, who specializes in the behavior of people, says that this is a number one cause of obeisity and prevents people from meeting other people outside or even plain exercise. I would say this isn't completely true because before even talking to anyone. Online people usually go for a jog around the neighborhood. Information is vital in our society and keeps us up-to-date on modern life. A computor can give us certain information like news and whether report. These days every smart person would go search information on a computor for not only missed news but for future forecast on whether to plan a picnic. This would be a helpful tool to our society in order to keep up with the world and not miss the latest event. I believe this is an advance in our modern day society because you could get the information you need. When you are in a rush to go to work don't you end up losing papers and files just forgetting about them? The computor can send data to a computor to conviently copy a file or document so you won't have to rush to work and worry about lost files. It has been known that thirty out of fifty people have saved themselves from losing a job from a computor. The computor can also hold and store data for later use like a song or picture. You could send that file and listen to it on another computor. Now is the time to decide if you should support computors. The computor can help you talk to long lost friends of one touch of a button. If you need certain information than you could find it on a computor without ever leaving your comfortable home. last and not least you could hold important files and documents and save yourself the trouble from rushing to work. So go and type that letter to a representative to help people see that computors are good for our society."	4	6		10																					
1226	1	"Dear Newspaper, I personally believe that new technology is a great thing. That’s why I think that computers have positive effects on our society. Some of these effects include developing skills to help people for present or future, getting a better education and helping people to become more social. Computers can help people in so many ways you just have to realize it. So come and see why computers are a good choice to have and use. My first reason of why I feel computers have positive effects on people is because they can help develop skills that one has and @MONTH1 not realize. For example a teenager @MONTH1 say while typing a paper that she really likes to write. So, she @MONTH1 go on the internet start looking at different styles and maybe she could become a famous journalist. It's all from the skills she got going online and searching what she enjoys. Another situation could be that a man applies for a job and then the employer' says he has to know how to use different softwear, so he could go on the computer and look for a tutorial on that specific softwear. A computer @MONTH1 help people build skills now and for their own future. My second reason of why computers can have positive effects on people is that it can help them get a better education. Any adult who hasn't gone to college and wants to can take classes online and earn their degree way. The education is just for adults; kids can go online and research history of different places they live and want to go. The great thing about you is you can find the information fast and easy. Computers help people learn more and get a better education for themselves. My final reason of why computers have positive effects is that they help people to be more social. There are so many ways to connect with family and freinds. You can send an email to someone and wait for a reply. Or now, you can even instant message somebody and talk to them like there in the same room. There are also websites, such @CAPS1 facebook, where you can get together and talk with old friends. Computers can help everyone connect with anyone @CAPS1 you can see computers have so many positive effects on people. They can help you build social skills for now and for our future. They can also help people get a better education. Plus, it is a great way to connect with past and present friends. Hopefully you can see how a computer can have positive effects on so many people."	4	4		8																					
1237	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people think that computers are used too much, and are helping people become over weight, and even obese. This is maybe true, but computers also teach hand eye coordination, give people the oppertunity to learn about far away places, and people can even coordinate on them! Over all I think computers effect people in a positive way, and these are some reasons why. Computers help teach hand eye coordination. I know your probably thinking “huh? How do computers do that? All your doing is staring at a screen.” But to your dismay computers do teach hand eye coordination. It does this because while playing games, people watch the screen, and click with their hands. They don’t just stare at the mouse while they play these games. By doing so, it teaches hand eye coordination. Scientist have provine that people who own a computer and use it at least @NUM1 hours a week, have better coordination that people who don’t own a computer by @PERCENT1! Just that statistic alone speaks a thousand words alone. Hand-eye coordination is a thing. It helps you play better in sports like baseball, and not only that but it helps future jobs. As you can tell, @CAPS1, without computers out hand eye coordination. People think that computers are only used for games, but in reality, they teach us @CAPS2 things about the world. Without computers people would know about nearly anything that’s going in other countries. For example, the other day, my mom was checking her email and came access the stay of a young, starving. That are story changer her anyday life because takes food for granted. Without computer my mom would have more in other countries. Because we live in the @CAPS4.S what’s going on in other countries. Are less fortanite, but computer help remind and teach us what’s going in the world everyday. One of the main advantages about computers is they allow people to communicate through them. Even my grandmother said the, without computers, I wouldn’t be as close to you as I am today. “@CAPS5 and my grandmother use the website skype.com. This websit allows you to not only talk to the other person, but to see them too! Because of site like these. I’m allowed to stay in contact, and be able to see my grandmother who lives faraway. Without computers this wouldn’t be possible. Not only do computers let you talk to people far away, but people close too. I often find myself asking friends over the computer, what the homework is, or whens the next test, etc. Computers make it easier to connect to people near and far. In conclusion, computers help in all different ways. The world would be upside down without them. They give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, teach hand eye coordination, and allow people to communicate with each other. Computers have @CAPS2 flaws, but they also have so @CAPS2 positive effects too that I think they shine over all the tiny flaws. Thank you"	6	5		11																					
1240	1	"Dear editor, I believe that computers are a great and fun tool. But I also believe people can spend to much time on them. The computer is excellent. People can use them to type papers or reports, makes graphs, and other important things for us. Schools are using computers more and more now. Schools have websites for students to go to findout there homework, classwork, projects, reports, and extracredit. The school has even started doing something very new, allowing parents and kids to check the students grade online. Not only do the schools help students, but also everyday people help as well. if a student has a project but doesn't know how to start it then he or she can google there project and ways to start it. Computers can be real great and easy to use as you can see, for schoolwork. Computers are not only great for academic purposes, but also for leisure purposes. Before computers and internet, there were only these ways to have fun during boring times in the day. One was watching tv, reading a book, or going outside, if you could. What do I mean by that last sentence? If you lived in a city, then it would be harder to go outside because maybe you lived in an apartment or somewhere not a comunity. Then you couldn't go out; and reading books can become boring after a while, and maybe there was nothing on tv for you to watch. But when computers and internet cameout, people sould play games, watch videos, and talk to cousins or family who live far away. Computers are also good for social networks. Not all familys live close, but are a close family. But in this ec onomy we can't always afford to visit them whenever. So by using computers we can @CAPS1 them facebook them, ,myspace them, and even video chat with them, which as I said is great far away family. But at times people can become to obsesed with them. Some people spend all day on one website, particulary facebook or youtube. Do not get me wrong, these websites are fun and cool. But not cool enough to not go outside and have free, natural fun. I remember I logged into facebook and saw a girl on, I logged off around an hour later and she was still on, then I logged in again around @TIME1 and the same girl was on! That is just to long to be on one website. Computer are a great tool for humans to use for business, education, and leisure. But to much is not good."	5	5		10																					
1241	1	"Do you like computers? Do you use the internet to help you? Do you use it every day? Well @CAPS1 not this article gives you information about all of this. First, alot of people don't like computers because they say ther're to confusing. Actually computers are'nt that hard to work you just have to be patient and take some time to get used to it. Also, computers can make things easier like typing. why should you right @CAPS1 you have the option to use a computer which lets you write faster than you could on normal paper. Secondly the internet is very easier then books. All you have to do is go to @ORGANIZATION1 any other search engine type what your looking for in and in a split second you have all the information in the world on that topic. Also @CAPS1 your planing a vacation the internet can help. You can purchase plane tickets online and sometimes there are special discounts doing the web. Also, you can back hotels and look at live pictures with more than just . So when you back a vacation on the internet you know it will be a good one. Finally, you can purchase anything with a click of a button. Almost every website has discounts. I remeber the time when I bought @MONEY1 shoes @MONEY2 online. Also it usually ships to your house in a couple of days . Lastly going on it alot isn't bad. I go oh the computer almost every day but also go outside too. I can do this because at night when one one can go outside I go on the computer for school or for fun. Also, you can talk to your friends or family over the internet. What @CAPS1 your mom or dad wnet on a @NUM1 weeks buisiness trip. You could use your webcam and talk to them and see than like @CAPS1 you were in the same room. So is going on the computer really so bad? I don't think so @CAPS1 it is that helpful and easy to work with."	4	5		9																					
1244	1	"Deear Newspaper, I think that the effects that computers are having on people is a @CAPS1 thing because most people just sit at the computers all day long. In this letter I am going to talk about the effects of computers on people, what we could be doing instead, and what person are doing on the computer. First thing is that computers are having a @CAPS1 effect on people and there life computers are making people just fit inside on their computers all day and do nothing. They just sit there playing games also about @PERCENT1 of the people who are spending to much time on the computer are probally pating well their on the computer which that is why some people @MONTH1 be fat. Most of the people who spend all of they time on the computer is people in there @NUM1's and @NUM2's some are in there @NUM3's or @NUM4's. Just sitting there on the computer will get you. Where in life. It will not give you a job or school education. By just sitting at the computer for a while you will not be able to do things out side. If so many people were not on the computer all the time then they could be outside. Being outside they can play sports, ride bikes, swim, run and more. They could also get a job and make some money or go to college, kids who are on the computer to much could get out and go to the mall, hang with friends you could get some exercise, or just enjoy nature. There is no use for going on the computer and being there for more then @NUM5 or @NUM6 hours, the most you should be on the computer would be an hour to an hour and a half. Kids and teenagers should only go on the computer for homework and the rest of the time doing something eles. Well all of the kids grade through @NUM7 grade should go out a play with their toys and people @NUM8 grade and up should hang out with and do thing like go to the mall, see a movie, or just have a sleepover. Also everyone in these grades should interact with there families more by seeing them more then @NUM7/@NUM8 times a month and they could have parties or just get together and hang out. So people should do some of the other things I said instead of just going on the computer all of the time. The last thing is the things that people are doing on the computers which is like I sometimes go on facebook. Other people go on facebook, google, games looking up information, and more. They also have emails where they chat with other people. Another thing people go on is youtube and listen to music and watch veidos. So I don't think that the effect of the computers on people is a good thing. I think that people shoud be out doing things then just sitting at home on the computer. People who sit at home on computers could and probally will get to fat. So the effect of computers on people is @CAPS1."	4	4		8																					
1259	1	"To whomever this @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 your life without a laptop or a desktop computer. It would be hectic right? How will you keep up with your email or type of the articles for this very newspaper? Even though some people @MONTH1 believe that computers are taking away from exercise, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends, computers do have a positive effect on us. The list of reasons why is endless but three that stand out are you can communicate with people in other states or countries, it's more interesting to learn from a website than a textbook, and eventually @CAPS2 will be computerized anyway. Am I right? Have your old teachers ever assigned you a pen pal in another state or country? If yes, didn't you have to, write letters? Then, you had to wait at least @NUM1 weeks before your pen pal wrote back. If you had used computers, you would've gotten a response back within days. I know many parents and other adults @MONTH1 think that e-mails are a waste of energy but actually they're faster than letters will ever be. Has your daughter or son ever told you that reading from a textbook is boring? Yes? No? That's where computers come in. It's much more interesting to use the internet than reading from a book. I understand that some students can read from a book and retain all of the facts that they've learned from that one book but various students learn differently than that. If a student learns from the internet, they're more likely to remember it because they won't be put to sleep by the boredom of a textbook. Many people have mentioned and some statistics show that by at least @DATE1, @CAPS2 will be computerized. Do you seriously want to be the last one left behind? I wouldn't I understand that you are a person who likes to keep up with the current events so why not use your computer more often? When they say @CAPS2, they mean @CAPS2. They even have @CAPS3 tools on computer. So I want you to take a survey of how many people find computers effective and you'll be surprised. Many people will say the same that I've said. The choice is yours, which side are you on? Thank you."	5	5		10																					
1260	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 in the @NUM1 grade in @CAPS5 @CAPS6 In @LOCATION1. I'm writing to you because I heard that more and more people use computer, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. In @CAPS1 opinion I think it benfit society. If you keep reading I will fell why it benif society. @CAPS1 first reason that computer have a positive effect on people. For example, when I see @CAPS1 older brother go on the computer he look much smarter on it. That @NUM2 out of @NUM3 member of @CAPS1 family learn thing from the computer. @CAPS1 second reason that it teach hand eye coordination. For example, when I play games in the computer @CAPS1 hand are the ones doing every thing for me. (@PERSON1 example is that we I wacth the game @CAPS1 hand are roating) @CAPS7 @NUM4 of @NUM3 of human play games in the computer and let their hand do everything. @CAPS1 third reason that it give people the ability to learn. For example, when I was using the computer use too teach so much that I'm go on most of the time. @NUM6 of @NUM3 student study in computers and they learn about thing that they never knew. Also they have the ability learn more on the computer. Some one might say people are spending too much time on their computer. However, I said that computer help people learn about thing that happen in the word. For example, they could larn about the war that going on and how people are risking their life for this cause. In conclusion, In @CAPS1 opinion it benefit society. Computer have a positive effet, I theach hand eye, and it give people the ability to learn. I think you should put all you support in the problem."	4	4		8																					
1263	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think that more people should start using computers. They can offer things that just writing things down or a pece of paper cant, like being able to learn about things that aren't taught in school, you can talk with friends online and you can keep everything in one. The first reason I think more people should use computers is that they can learn about things that arent taught in. Such as current events, the history of our nation and how our government works. Now some people can argue that you can learn about current events on @CAPS1 or a newspaper. But the computer can give you the news in an article then show you it in a video. Also in my opinion the news from the internet is visually less condensed than on @CAPS1. Another reason I think more people should use computers is that you can talk with friends over the internet. This is great because there @MONTH1 be people you havent seen in awhile because they moved. I had a friend who moved to pitsburg when I was @NUM1 and when I got u @CAPS3 account I was able to find him and talk with him a while of him visiting. Or you can just keep in touch with friends that so to a different school. The last reason I think people should use computers is that you can keep pictures, videos, document and contacts on your hard time. This is important to because I am not very well organized when it comes to school. But I started using my book and started to some of the work on the computer. This helped me be less clutteres and keep all my work in our place. It also means you can email that walk to a teacher or notes a friend who might have missed school that day. So in conclusion that or why I think we should have peple we computers more. They can help you learn, let you talk with friends, or let you keep everything in one place. That is why I think more people should use computers."	5	4		9																					
1280	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I think, in my opinion, that computers benefit to society greatly. The reasons I believe this is because of @NUM1 main reasons: Computers are a limitless source of knowledge, there are websites with online communities and it's just plain fun to use. Computers, as we all know, are a limitless source of knowledge. Now then, as you know adults need to work A @CAPS2 so most of the time if someone has to research something for work they could use a computer. Even kids who go to school need to use the internet of the computer for something like a project or homework. Now I know everyone, kids and teens especially, love to talk to their friends so most people sign up for an online community website. Now I'm very aware of online pedophiles but that can be taken care of by the fact of having friends you know of in real life to sign up as well. Lastly, I have to say computers are just fun to use. Kids like me that normally have a long rough day at school like to come home and rest with some nice game on the computer. Now this sounds like it just lazy but it is something nice to do for a distraction to other things. And thats where I stand on terms of the endless knowledge, online communities, and just plain fun of the computer."	3	3		6																					
1282	1	"Dear newspaper editor, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 have and use computers everyday. Computers are killing us as a nation. We need to put a stop to this abuse of computers. Millions of parents and kids spend at least @NUM1 minutes a day on the computer. They are either working or playing. There are many @CAPS2 games and other types of games out on the internet. Kids use these as entertainment. But having an @NUM2 year old child playing a game with guns is certainly unnacceptable. Kids often get so caught up in playing these addictive games that they don't even think of playing sports or going outside. Therefore, the child loses much needed exercise and fresh air. This can lead to obesity or other weight issues. @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 are already obese, so why keep these horrid games out there? The last thing @LOCATION1 needs is more kids becoming fat!! There are two ways to use a computer for good and for bad ways to use them for good can be for planning a vacation, or working at a job, or even to look at a child's grades online. But many kids and parents don't use computers for these reasons. Kids have been caught looking at porn, buying illegal drugs, hacking into systems and other criminal type things. The computer is a way to do things that you shouldn't, while keeping your identity hidden. For example, whever I sign-up for a website subscription so I can play a game, it asks me for personal information. It askes for my name, my address, my phone number and other things. So what my mother has taught me to do is to use false info. So a computer hacker or a fraud site can't steal my personal info. And who are we to know that people don't do this with illegal programs? Computers are dangerous to @LOCATION1's well-being. On top of obesity, there have been reported cases of a child or parent having a seizure, having the picture of a game implanted in their eyes because they don't take their eyes of the game. There has even been a case of where a chid went mad and killed his/her parents in rage. Computers turn kids and parents into wild beasts. Parents commonly try to get their children to stop playing certain games. In some cases, the parent destroys an account on a website or takes a computer away for a certain ammount of time. These actions from parents have caused kids to go mentally insane! Cases have been reported of smashing computers, doing bad in school, killing parents as I said earlier and in some cases suicide. So in conclusion, computers are a source of health issues, action issues and mental issues. If we want @LOCATION1 to be restored to the @LOCATION1 we all love, then we the people, must put a stop to this computer addiction!"	5	5		10																					
1283	1	"Dear @CAPS1, In a recent poll it was determined that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have used or come in contact with computers. @PERCENT2 of those said @CAPS2 use computers daily, and not just for work. This extensive use of technology creates a lack in their exercising habits, @CAPS4, they enjoy nature much less. Furthermore, people spend less time interacting with family and friends. These are demaging effects on our society. ""The biggest reason why people dont exercise, "" says health proffessor @PERSON1, ""is because they just don't have time."" This problem can be directly attributed to the statistic that on average, @CAPS2 spend @NUM1 and a half hours a day on the computer. You can argue that they @MONTH1 be learning new things or broadening their horizons. However, none or which help these people get or stay healthy and in shape. Being on the computer does no good for the body. Click the next link and watch as a beautiful humming bird swarms across the screen of your desktop. You can clearly see its wonder, but can you feel it? Can you smell the fresh air it flies around? The computer can only show you nature, but you must log off and find it for yourself to truly appreciate it firsthand. Society will only cheat itself of the world's splendor while watching it on screen. Fans of computers will argue that they help you interact with people around the world, but what about the people in the next room? Computers @MONTH1 bring you to people globally, but distance you from people at your job, school or home. As humans, they need contact with the outside world. Why limit themselves to typing to people, when they can talk to them? In conclusion, extensive computer use does not benefit society. People will spend less time staying active. More over, people will enjoy nature on a desktop instead of in person. Finally, society will not spend as much time communicating with family and friends in person. The time has come to take a stance. It should be clear that computers are a danger to society."	5	5		10																					
1285	1	"The effects that i have on computers are good. I will be talkin about things that help the human nature with one technology computers. How people can learn about faraway palces. Helps them with school, and taxes. How to communicate with people that arnt with you. and my conclusion with all three reasons. The effects of computers on me are very good. Because they help people learn about faraway places. Lets say a family is planning a vocation to @LOCATION1. And they dont no anthing about it so they go on a computer and they could book a reserucition for a hotel. My second opinion on computer is that. you have a project for school and you need the right information. Thats not in books go on a computer. Lets say you have to do taxes online because your cripplede (@CAPS1) so you might wanna @NUM1 www. turbotax.com. and you hale your taxes infront of your eyes. My hold opinion on computers is. @NUM2 you have a friend or family member you lost contact with. Go on the computer and find them and then you guyz can plan a day were you guyz could catch up/ @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 guardians have issues about there child. They can confront the situation about three child. and last ley my last conclusion. Thats what i feel about computer. That we need them to communicate to other people. To do assignments for a job or school. Or to learn about places that you never been to before or would like to vacation to. And the reason why i feel like that is because i passion for computer. And i hope you like what i wrote. I hope i persuaded you to like computers more."	4	4		8																					
1293	1	"Dear local news papers, I'm writing to tell you that people on the computer is not a bad thing. Would you enjoy being bord? Or to enter tained while learning something? Being on the computer helps with hand eye coordination, you can learn about amazing places, and even talk friends. Hand eye cordination is good because it good. Save millions of people in war for example my grandpa went into the @ORGANIZATION1 and @NUM1 people were firing at him but he had good hand eye cordination from the computer go it saved his life less people will get hurt like getting your hand gramed in the car door. There would be more to do. The more something just as important as hand eye cordination is learning! On the internet you can learn about anything and everything. if you learn about far away places you will be able to widen your conversation people will think your smarter and you'll feel good, not only what other people think you sin truelly get smarter. Most importantly you can talk to friends! If you are taking so your friends it can build up your self asteam and when you go to school you'll social did you know @PERCENT1 of people do better in school if they comunicate online? Don't you wish every day you could be proud of your self? Well talking online helps! This is why im writing to you to share all my ideas and concerns.

1299	1	"Dear @PERSON2, Have you ever noticed how different our society is today, even from just ten years ago? That's because of computers. Yes, it is true that computer give us advantages like messaging and information, but they also take away from some of the greater aspects of life: staying fit, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. Without those, life would be horribly unbeneficial. While surfing the web @MONTH1 be fun, it has been proven unhealthy. ""if a person was to spend more than two and a half hours on the computer every @TIME1 for about a month they would see a sudden increase in their gain. And if they kept the behavior up, they could gain up to one third their initial body weight until medical help was provided,"" say @PERSON3, a specialist in obesity at @ORGANIZATION1. Also, @PERCENT1 of all computer users snack while online, which only increases weight gain even more. Unfortunately those that spend alot of time on the computer are not usually okay with exercising either. Instead of outing down just a half an hour out of their computer time to play with the dog, take a jog, or try some aerobics, computer lovers usually just stay in front of the screen. That's too bad, because it causes health problems for them and maybe even the generations after them. Nature, is being ignored @CAPS1, more than ever. @PERSON1 can recall the time when the trails @CAPS2 runs were overrun with people. ""@CAPS1"" @CAPS2 says ""They're being overrun with woods and. Those are harder to act rid of that people."" But it's live, the trails and that to be fuller nature lovers are numbers. Because of today's new technologies, especially computers, the beauty of nature is being almost completely passed by. Some worry if it will fade entirely and instead of trying to maintain what's left, well just let it do so. Hopefully though, the next generation of people will reconize this horrible mistakes. Doctors, @CAPS3, all people alike are seeing more and more how computers affect family life. How often do you eat dinner with the whole family. When you don't, where are you most of the time? At the computer? That's what I thought. When computers and other technologies are available there is much less of a chance that you will actually interact with family and friends. mrs @PERSON4, an @NUM1 grade teacher in @LOCATION1, noticed that her family spent less time together than ever before when each family member got a laptop. @CAPS2 believes this is pulling her family apart. Do you? As you can conclude, computers have an awful influence, on society: people do not take, the time to stay fit, nature is being completely ignored, and Family interaction rates are poor. Whaat can we do to fix this problem? Just set a little time aside daily to observe these aspects of life. This way, life with computers will be beneficial after all."	5	6		11																					
1300	1	"I do not beileve that computers benefit society. Kids can learn more but they spend too much time on line. When kids talk to people on line they don't know if it is really someone you know. There are techneral problems with them that deileate files. For these reasons is why computers do not benefit society. Kids spend too much time on computers. Computers do teach you more things, but they also have games. Children spend most of their time on games than studying. Chidren can get agressive when loss of exersise. Thats what is happening today. Kids are loosing exersise an are getting hevier. They can evan loose intrest. All they want to do is go on the computer. Kids talk to people, how do they know who they really are? People can make a fake e-mail adress and make a false account on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2-space. These people want children's personal information. Also if you are talking to someone that has a name of someone you know. The person just might be a freand. Like me. I was talking to @CAPS2 cousin on @CAPS1 (the account said his name) but it was his wife. That is why you need to be carful about what you say and who it is you are really talking to. Computers have virouses. When computers get virouses, they can deilete the files you want to save. If you had a video on the news you want to keep it. Youu put it under favorates, they you get a virouse that deleites the file. The video is how off the wedsite. Sometimes your computer doesn't bring you to the wed anymore. You how have to click alot of places to get there. For these resons is why computers are not benefical to society. Kids spend to much time on computers. Kids can talk to people they don't know on them. Computers have technical problems that delete files.

Advanced technology today allows you to do almost everything that would have been considered impossible @DATE1 decades @DATE1. We need to decide whether computers have positive or negative effect on people. I firmly believe computers gives society many benefits and opportunities. Who would disagree that computers are devoted to educational purposes? Computer experts have invented countless programs that make @ORGANIZATION1 easier for kids. For example, @CAPS1 helps you with essays and reports. With her program teachers wouldn't hurt their eyes trying to read sloppy hand written compositions from students @ORGANIZATION2 helps you organize and calculate, @ORGANIZATION3 gives you the @ORGANIZATION3 to create dynamic presentations. Many schools have a computer lab for students to complete their @ORGANIZATION1 tasks. @ORGANIZATION1 has also aquired convenient-sized laptops to help students do their projects and take test. That saves a lot of paper and a lot of trees! Furthermore, many colleges offer their courses online. You can obtain a college degree right at your house without going anywhere. Education has never been so easy, thanks to our advanced network and computers. It is very important to mention the entertainment benefits of computers. I have notices many teens play cool games on the net. They seem to greatly enjoy this opportunity. It in an ideal way to relax after a stressful way getting on the computer and listening to the newest songs. Some websites after downloadable songs for free so you don't need to worry about the financial part. Moreover you can watch movies online anytime, form wide section such as horror, romance, comedy, fantasy or even children films. No more movie tickets, no more driving in the theater. Without a doubt computers can put a single on everyone's face with its entertainment benefits. Many people feel that computers both kids and adults always from their social life, but actually, computers give them a chance to communicate with other people around the world. Ten @DATE1 @DATE1, who would have thought that they could chat and talk directly with same one a thousand miles @DATE1, with no mail or telephone or whats over? I came to the @LOCATION1 @DATE1. I am extremely grateful to computers because I can keep in touch with my friends and relatives. I can just send them pictures of the snowy winter sceneries here through just a minute. How much easier could it get? computers definitely improve communication and brings people closer. Let's not wait any longer. Computers have endless positive effects and should be popularizeas.

1305	1	"Dear @CAPS1: A @CAPS2. Can you believe that this tiny piece of technology is influencing our everyday life? The question upon many people is, do computers give a possitive or negative effect on people? In my opinion, although computers help with certain everyday life, I think that it gives one negative effects. I have many reasons for this belief, but the three most important are going to be stated. First of all, people are to busy on their computers that they spend less time. People are also in busy with there computers that they spend less and less time enjoying nature. Last but most importantly, people are so caught up with technology, they barely spend time with freinds and family. So, in my opinion, I think people should get technology, and the real world. Have you ever walked down the street and saw someone the size of a boulder? well it isn't a good sight is it? My point is, that can happen to you let me change that to everyone in the world. Nowadays, people are spending less and less time exercising, but instead sitting at home on the computer, or slouched on the couch with a laptop. People are ignoring their health and instead staying on the computer. I for one, know how hard it is to resist playing the computer, but you shouldn't let a tiny @CAPS2 take over your mind and now your future. Nature. The most wonderful thing in the world I say the second most wonderful to technology. Have you ever turned on the t.v. and see nature its beauty? Well you can thank and global warming for that. When people use computers they burning fuel which harms our environment. People are technology they don't care about their and surroundings. If I was a I would say, ""@CAPS3 less computers and @CAPS3 more green!"" @CAPS4..... it's luxury of having a family. Family and friends , it's most important thing. Sue to computers, many people are family and friends. For example: @CAPS5: @CAPS6 want to go ride bikes? John: @CAPS7. I want to play my computer. Kids and adults was single-handed. In my opnion family most important, unlike a piece of metal that has a screen In conclusion, I think that computers of a regular effect on people, life you people by it. People are spending less time with their health and exercising advance in technology. They are all spending less time at the park big or simply just enjoying nature's beauty. Most importantly, there is less interacting with friends and family. But, this is just my opinion, it won't mean anything if you don't agree. I consideration."	6	5		11																					
1308	1	"I think that computers have a positive effect on people because you can communicate with different places around the world. Store things on them, and use them for entertainment. Computers have a positive effect because you can communicate with other people around the world. This is good because instead of calling people you can go on computer and talk to them for free. Long distance phone calls cost a lot. But if you can just go on your computer and talk to them there's going to be no charge. Being able to talk to other people over the internet is very useful and fun. If there wasnt a computer people would be talking to as much people and there social life would be bad making there life not as exciting. This is one reason why I think that computer have a positive effect on people. Another reason why computers give a positive effect in people if you have a lot of paperwork that is just lieing around is in the way. Well if you have a computer there are featers that your able to store thing and because much more organized. Being more organized there is less stress one you start to feel better about lossing things and being able to find them. This is why I think that computers are very great and useful. The last reason why I think that computers have a positive effect on people is that people can use it for entertainment. Computers can do many things like play game, listen to music, watch videos, and chat with your friends. Being able to play games for free on your computer is awesome. If you cant aford to get a game system them you are able to go on your computer and play pretty much what ever game or close to the game that you want to play. A computer can also play music. You can have @CAPS1 and download musics to something or go to web sites that have musical on them. Also you can do video chats with your friends if they live far away. I hope that I convinced you to like computers more and think that they are great and have a positive effect on people. Being able to play games, store thing, and chat with other people is pretty amazing."	5	4		9																					
1310	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to you about how technology affects people. My argument is that some people think that Computers are taking to much of people time, I will tell you how technology keeps people from excersizeing and gaining life expieriences. Now I will explain in further details. My first reason for sayi-ng computers affect people is that they cant get excersize when there face is glued to a computer screen all day. And especially with the amount of kids palying video games or playing on the computer, the childhood obeasity rate will slowly rise due to them not getting excersize or they will just get very weak. That is why computers have a negative affect on people by not letting them get the excersize they need. My seconed reason for saying computers have a negative affect on people is that they won't be able to gain life experience I say this because when something asks you ""@CAPS3, what did you do today?"" youre only answer could be ""@CAPS4, can we chande the question to what did I not do today?"" @CAPS5 when your on the computer all day you wont be able to explore and obseve nature well maybe you could do that on a @CAPS6 server but it isnt the same. And even when parent ask if you want to go for a walk you should do it, You could learn somthing or see somthing you wouldn't be able to see on a daily basis. That is why computers have a negative affect on people when their face is glued to a computer. So now I am going to close this letter and I hope you see that excersize and gaining life experiences will change your life forever."	4	3		7

I strongly believe that computers do indeed benefit humanity for it allows people to talk online with loved ones and friends across the globe, and learn about those foreign places. Computers don't take away from lifes, but shows it through fascinating synthetics. Computers allow people of all ages to interact with others over the world-wide web. Sometimes it's better to meet with people in person, but that isn't always the case. What @CAPS5 you have relatives or friends in a different country? The internet is the best way to contact those people. Also, what @CAPS5 you are in a band or a group, and need to contact them while you are out of town? Social sites like facebook or myspace allow the group members to talk and discuss matters at the hotel or wherever he @MONTH1 be.

We can see things we would be seeing @CAPS5 we were present at the place, but instead on a monitor in your home.

Books can be helpful defending on when it was made. Internet websites can gives you pictures uploads almost every week. Therefore you know where you want to book your next visit.

Now, are you for or against this descison of people getting ""hooked"" on computers? In my opinion people should be enjoying things and not spend most of their time on computers. Since people are so dependent on computers, sometimes working form one can hurt your vision. The bright white computer screen filled with all those e-mails can really affect your vision. I know my dad always gets headaches and his vision isn't the best thing when it comes to him working on a computer all day. Being indoors and on a computer all day long makes you really miss the outdoor activites that their are.

People cannot agree on whether computers are a good privelage to the society or just bumping it down year after year. I think computers do have a positive effect on people. This is because they teach hand-eye coordination, give them knowlege about cultures around the world, and allow people to communicate with one another. Do you think the downsides really outweigh these positives? Hand-eye coordination is not something you are born with. You gain it as you get older and acheive practive. Computers help with this goal.

And it not only helps with baseball, but with other sports such as juggling, golf or tennis. If you get very good at these sports, you can play them for fun, or even as a proffessional. Who knew that playing on the @ORGANIZATION1 could get you so far in life?! Did you know, according to ""Time"" magazine, that people who go on the @ORGANIZATION1 are better able to focus on tasks, such as schoolwork, because it enables your hands and eyes to work together as one? And everyone knows that if you get good grades in school, almost any job you could be qualified in? Then, you can earn a good amount of money, and live your dream life!! Oh, great another @NUM1 hour day of school. Hhmm. What do I have first block? @LOCATION3 history. What? Yes! We're doing a culture project! That means I can easily go on the @ORGANIZATION1 and find out great things about what place I'm assigned. That's another up-put about computers. Easy access to tons of useful information. I have cheerleading everyday after school until @NUM2. If I have a project, I don't have hours and hours to look in books and find out what I need to know. Computers allow me to do my sport and still get a good grade in school. @PERCENT2 of people use computers to do their informational work about faraway places. It is faster and more accurate. You could just search through your bookshelf to find an almanac. But once you find it, you would need to check the copyright. Hopefully it's recent. If not, you're in trouble. Would you feel like prying through more shelves to be acccurate? Facebook, @CAPS1, @CAPS2. All new ways to communicate with people. Just another useful effect on people. Forgot to write down your homework? Hopefully your friend didn't and you can just ask them. ""@PERCENT3 of people don't chat with others online."" says @LOCATION2 @ORGANIZATION1 expert. Most of it has to be for some reason or another. Such as homework, what happened that day, or how they haven't seen eachother in forever. Don't you chat with people online? Trust me, it can be a gradesaver. Maybe this will help you conclude that computers give a positive effect on society because of handeye coordination, information, and chatting. What would we do without them?"	5	5		10																					
1326	1	"Dear trained readers, @CAPS1't you agree that more and more people use computers. Well I @CAPS2 because it gives us the information we want to see. Recently it has been brought to my attention that some people agree that some people @CAPS3 themselves don't really use computers. Without a dout I firmly believe that people that dont use computers should start to use them. but I can understand why same people don't use computers. Maybe they dont know how to use one have better things to @CAPS2, or can't afford one. First of @CAPS5, they dont know how to use one. I remember when my friend was over and I was on a computer. and he @CAPS4 ""@CAPS2 you know that some people don't know how to use an computer?"" And I @CAPS4 ""@CAPS3 who?"" the @CAPS4 ""@CAPS3 me, I dont know to use one."" I @CAPS4 well I'll teach you. Since then @CAPS5 my friend does is go on the computer. One day he says to me because of I want to work with computers. this is one of my reasons why people don't use computers. Second of @CAPS5, have better things to @CAPS2. @MONTH1 be someone has a game. for example, I mostly have how time to go on the computer. Usually I have a basketball game or practice I get home from practice and feel exhausled, @CAPS5 I want to @CAPS2 is go to @CAPS6. why parents come have not wanting to @CAPS2 anything. I'll tell you why. Because @CAPS5 that haved They @CAPS2 @CAPS5 day. This is another one of my reasons why people dont use computers. Third of @CAPS5 can't afford one. Some people dont have a lot of money to buy a computer. They have to say it. so they can live in a house. When parent's children asle for something parents shoudn't buy it. They buy it so you dont feel hurt. When I'm a @CAPS7 im going to make sure I have enough money to buy it. If not then I guess that child is out of luck. So dont be going where bragging your computer because some can't afford one. This is my last reason why people don't use computers. this is why some people don't use computers now in days. Because they dont know how to use one, have something better to @CAPS2 and can't afford one. By the way; @PERCENT1 of the pupils of @ORGANIZATION1 dont have computers."	4	4		8																					
1329	1	"Dear local newspaper, I believe computers doesn't benefit society. I feel this way being that lack of email skills, no exercising, and its addicting. Read on for further explaing. Firstly, spending hours and hars on the computer gives you no social skills what on ever. You could think before you reply and most people online talk or write way differently there then in person. People could act like someone else. Online you could erase what you wrote but in person you can't. Thats way you simply can't gain social skills sending all this time talking online. Next, you get no exercises. On a nice beautiful @DATE1 you'll be inside on the computer when you could be getting exercise. Being on line sitting down doing nothing just talking makes you lazy. When you're older you'll have to be writing. You can't just good all these long house on the computer. Furthermore, you should have your time for on the computer and exercising. Finally, its addicting some people could good hours and hours on the computer looking up all these videos. Seven out of ten teenagers rather be inside in the computer talking to people rather then meeting new people elsewhere. I think parents should restrict their children's time to be on computers. All this time with this fun could be spent doing studying or something to help you out in the future. In conclusion, i believe computers doesn't benefit society. I feel this way being lack of social skills, no exercise, and addicting. I think some people shold limit their time another computer and expand their time doing something important."	4	3		7																					
1331	1	"Computers were built to help the people make tasks easier and quicker. Since then, they have been updated over and over untill what they are today. Computers are a part of most peoples everydaylives, and essential to most bussiness.But the common question in our society is, are computers really benefitting us? My answer is yes. Computers do many things for us. They teach us hand-eye coordinatin, give us the ability to research effectivly, and recently, became a great way of communication, @CAPS1's are definately benefitting us. One reason why computers help us is by teaching hand-eye coordination. In a magazine I read, one expect, (@PERSON1) said that leading to type without looking is a great way of improving reflexes. The speed that you type is improved with practice. Another way it improves hand-eye coordination is by learning to click and react to different things effectively. I often on being ammused by playing games on the computer. These games usually are hard, but with my improving hand-eye coordination, I am learning how to play these games well. My father always tells me to learn my way through a computer because they are our future, soon, mostly everything will be done by them with the improving technokolgy, it is impossible for it not to be benificial to our society. Our home computers have been great at teaching me thing like hand-eye coordination. Another reason why computers are great is by making that tough history paper, just a click away. My garndfather always tells me how easy I have it. Instead of going to the @CAPS2 and having to pick out a book, I just go to google and have an entire search engine infront of me. When we go into highschool we will need a computer to suceed. To keep our essays organized, our research effective, and the clear to read typing right infront of us. My brother tells me that having a computer is the best investment has ever made. Last year, we had a science assignment to figure out how our heart beats faster. This way very easy considering I typed it in and had hundreds of ways to increase my pulse rate. Computers have changed the way we research and finish school works. The last reason why computers are fantastic is beacuse they make communication just a click away. A couple weeks ago, my coach emailed us that our gametime has changed. This doesn't seem like a big thing, but without his @CAPS1, we would've missed the game. My cousin @CAPS3 is from @LOCATION1. Me and him meet only once a year. With that limited time, we can't really get out what we need to. Recently, i bought a webcam and have been chatting with him on it every week. It is almost like he's with me. All the girls in our school can't get enough of me. So I get home after sports, go on, and theres always enough of me to go around. Webcamming is a great way of communication. With all the new computer going on sale and new appliances coming no one knows when it will stop. Well, the question still lingere, are computers benificial to our society? The answer @MONTH1 never come about, but at least for me, improving hand-eye, researching being a breeze, and communication just waiting for me is a pretty sweet deal. So for now, I stand by the opinion that computers are great, and extremely useful to everyone."	5	4		9																					
1332	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to you to let you know my opinion on computers and technologies. Computers have now become part of our society and culture and is very important by following reasons. One computers let you surf online anytime you want. Two, computers allow people talk online. First reason why computers are so critical in our culture is that computers let you surf online anywhere and anytime you want. This is very convenient. What if you live far away from the nearest library? When you have to write a research paper? Jane lives @NUM1 miles away from her town library. Her mother could drive her ther, but what if she wasn't at home or driving someone else to a doctor's appointment? This is when computers come in handy. Jane can just simply go online and do the research! Not only that but also, ""www.internetsocool.gov"" states that information you can find in a regular library is about @NUM2 of information you can find online. Secondly, computers let you talk with people both faraway and nearby online and videochat. This is very useful for me. Since I live by myself in @LOCATION1, I miss my family a lot. Although with internet, I can talk to my family whenever I want! Also, you can video chat with your lab partner to discuss how you can make the lab report better! @PERSON1, the author of ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"" also states in his book that over @NUM3 million people use internet to videochat for educational purposes. In conclusion, ivideochat @MONTH1 sound like something to do for lark, but it is actually used for many good purposes. On the other hand, some people say that computers are bad. Some say that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising and spending time their family. Although, ""The @DATE1 survey of what people do,"" states that @PERCENT1 of people who use computers are healthy both physically and emotionally. Just because we use computers to make our life easier, it does not mean that we don't value spending time with family. In conclusion in our culture because are very crucial in our culture because it can let you surf online and help you interact with people who live faraway."	5	4		9																					
1337	1	"Are people today spending to much time on computers. If so had done it affect thous. In our modern day people spend to time on computers. Both me and think that this is affecting people in many different ways. Some ways it by. Health your social life, and also your education. Spending to much time on a pc can effect your in many ways. For example exercise. The people spend all there time siting in a chair they could have a chance of gaining wait. Then you might be getting all the you need because your on the computer you might not go to to get the and veggies. Your want to just so you the computer. Social life @CAPS1, you could have with all the people you are also will them. Another big problem is education. Is you are all day on the computer anything @CAPS2 you it's not on the computer you Those are some of the resons why I think people shouldn't spend to much time on the computer."	4	4		8																					
1342	1	"Do you think people spend to much time on the computer do. I think that kids and adults spend to much time @CAPS1, twitering, doing facebook and myspace. My resons include, people should go outside more, and play with real people, and spend time with family. Most kids should go out side more for example my friend @PERSON3 spent @NUM1 hours a day! on his computer and haven went outside. Another example is my neghbor @PERSON2 spent all day! in his basement playing on his computer and haven went outside and since he hevet went outside he is terreibely the sun and he is now @NUM2 years old an dhe still dont go outside it was because he spent to much time on the computer. Secondly, people should play with real people. For example there was a kid name @CAPS2 and he allways played with vertual people an dfrends and never realy pleople and now he is so shy around real people that he wont even say one word. Another example is @CAPS3 he only had vertual frend and never a real one and he is so depress becose he never had a best frend. Thirdly you should spend time with your family. there was a named @CAPS4 and he never spent time with his family becse he was to busy writing emails and @PERSON1 says that kids who dont interact with them wont have the same benifits as kids who do. Another example there was a family who were to bisy with the computer that the kids never met the grandparents and when the grand parents passed away the kids never met them becse they would rather play on there computers. In conclution people should go outside more, play with real people, and visit there family then if you want to play on your computer then after reading all of these examples then go ahead."	4	4		8																					
1344	1	"In the world we live in now, everything is getting technilogical. In my own opinion, its a good thing. Using computers has been very helpful to our society. They give people the opportunity to research things fast and easily, they save trees, and they're a wonderful way to communicate with people. First, computers are great to use for research instead of books that waste tree. A few years ago, kids would get a school project on a certain country and the thing that would came to mind is the library. But, nowadays it's computers. Sure, of course books are very helpful, but so is the internet, plus its much faster and easier to find to find the information you're boking for. You can learn about a place before visiting it with a click of a button and learn about places far away. It really is magical. Next, using computers saves trees. With a computer we don't have to keep cutting down so many trees for books and paper. Another can now sell their books online and people are able to read them right. Honestly, there really is no reason to keep making books. Even students can do their home work, test and quizzes online! I think it's a mirical and it's so amazing to see how much our world has changed in only about @NUM1 years. Finally, computers are great to communicate with people far away. Some people have family in the war who they don't see for months or maybe years. With a computer you can get emails that get deliveres to the person right after being sent. Or you can even webcam and actually see the person face to face! It must be hard not being able to see your loved ones everyday, which is why a computer is very helpful. Even to those who have a family member away on a business trip or that live in another state/country. Computers are very helpful, especially today with everything going on in our world. With computers we can online research, save trees, and communicate with people far away. So, in my opinion computers do benefit society."	4	4		8																					
1350	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, With computers being so popular right now it's easy to think that they are helpful and have a positive effect on the people that use them. However, I do do belive that computers have more harmful effects than good ones on the people they are used by. I belive this for @NUM1 reasons. One, they take away from spending time with real people, they make people get less excersis, and also they are very distracting and waste time. One reason why I don't think computers have a positive effect on people is that the time spent on the computer could be put to better use by doing things with family and friends. Now and day people are using social networking sites like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 to talk with people far away. People can spend hours communication with someone they will never meet and completly ignore the people who care for and love them. Also communication with people online can be dangerous because the person who you are messaging might not be who they say they are. Overall, setting out and actually spending time with real people creates memories that you will cherish for the rest of your life. This feeling can never occur through the internet. Another reason why I think that computers have a bad effect on their users is that constant computer use has resulted in a lack of excersise for many people. People who use computers for many hours are just sitting still. They aren't being active. The only movement that occurs while on a computer is the tiny flick of a finger as it clicks the mouse button. This is clearly not enough excersise that is required to maintain a healthy and happy lifestyle. Studies have shown that since the invention of computers young people especially have been gretting less and less physical activity. I'm sure that this will continue to get worse if people continue spending a majority of time on their computers. A third reason why I think computers are having a negative effect on people is because they are distracting and they waste time. An example of this is that once when I was online doing research for a school project, I saw an advertisment for a website that looked interesting. When I clicked on it I was brought to a site full of funny stories and pictures. I spent the next half an hour reading entries on that website and completely forgot about my project. When I relized what I had done I rushed to finish my research and ended up getting a poorer grade then. I'm sure I would have gotten if I had not been distracted other things to do on the computer. This is why I think computers do not have a good effect on the people who use them. They take away from spending time with family and friends, they result in less excercise. And they waste time and are distractions. "	5	5		10																					
1351	1	"Dear local @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people have been using computers for years. But @CAPS3 it good for there health. Were not thinking about what power teens have with the internet. If you need info. We have lots of great books. If we need communication we have phones. We need to go outside and exercise. @CAPS3 the computer another reason why america @CAPS3 becoming obese? First, teens can do harmful stuff on the internet to themselves or others. People have invented facebook and myspace. Almost every teen in america has a facebook. Did you know that theres cyberbullying now. People have humiliated others on the internet. How do we know that the person were talking to @CAPS3 who he/she say's he/she @CAPS3? Teens give away to much info of themselves, some have gone missing from such an action. The internet @CAPS3 a powerful weapon, but can teens handle this kind of power? Next, although the computer @CAPS3 a convient device. @CAPS3 it not true that we have something called books. We cant believe everything that @CAPS3 said on the computer . We can get all that we need and more off of books. People lived in the middle ages without computers, but with books. Why can we. Have we grown lazy to do such a thing as to get up and look through a book. Finaly, if communication we seek, then why not a simple text or call. we go through all the trouble of turning on and opening pages just to chat online. We have become lazy because of device's that have all we need in our homes. sure its a good thing but dont forget a bad one to. It seems like the computer @CAPS3 another reason for america growing obese. We need to get up walk, hang out with friends, do sports. But how can we when were adicted to computers. It's like a powerful drug. To conclude I think computers are not good for us. Teens with the power of facebook. Fake and dangerous info when we have book. Lastly, our own health. At this point I ask you, @CAPS3 the computer worth everything we think it @CAPS3? No, it @CAPS3 not."	4	5		9																					
1354	1	"Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive affect on society. I believe computers have a positive affect because they help us learn of faraway places, they help us communicate with friends and family all over the world, and computers help entertain people. The computer has a positive affect on society because on it you can learn of faraway places, their history, and you can learn of their landscape. By learning these things you can do a lot of things such as plan a vacation, this information can help you on a school report, also this information can help you learn of your heiratage & your culture. Also computers have a positive effect and are beneficial to society because they help you communicate with friends and family all over the world! You can communicate with anyone you know. Nowadays everyone uses the computer as their main form of communication. In a study it showed that @PERCENT1 of people in the world has a computer as a communication tool. Lastly computers are beneficial to society because they entertain us. On a computer you can do many things to never get bored. You can play games, surf the web, or you can watch videos on networks such as youtube. So on a computer you'll never be bored. The computer is beneficial and has a positive affect on society. The computer helps us learn of faraway places, it lets us communicate with friends and family all over the globe, and lastly the computer entertain us. Thats why the computer is beneficial to society."	4	4		8																					
1355	1	"I don't think computers benefit the society as much as every one thinks. When people spend most of their time on computers they don't have time to spend with their family, people don't excersise enough when they are on computers wich causes them to become obiese, and you @MONTH1 meet up somewhere with a bad person you met in facebook or myspace. These are the main reasons computers don't benefit society. The number one reason computers ain't beneficial is because you need sometime to spend with your family. But, when you are on computers twenty-four-seven you have absolutly no time with your family and friends. I belive that families need to eat dinner together and have at least one hour with one another. Some good ways to spend time with your family is to play games together, go on a walk, or even go to a bike ride together. Did you know that computers have a medium sized effect on how people become obiese? If you are at school from seven till -thirty and after school you spend seven hours on your computer you will become fatter because you will have absolutly no time to excersise. When you just eat and don't excersise your body will not just burn off all that fat you ate. When you are on a computer you are probably go on to facebook or myspace. On these chating websites you can make arangments to go some where with someone you don't even know. If you meet up with them they could be a killer, a kidnaper, or a rapist. So there for you can litteraly die or get hurt because of your computer. Thats why e-mail is the absolute safest way to chat online if your were to have a computer. These are the main reasons why computers are not beneficial to the society. Also you @MONTH1 not spend enough time with family or friends, you can become obiese because you don't have ""time"" to excersise and you can be kidnapt by someone you don't even know through facebook or myspace. How would you like it if you had no time with your family, you were obiese, and you got kidnaped because you met up with someone that thought was nice through facebook or even myspace?"	4	4		8																					
1359	1	"Dear Newspaper, Computers have a huge effect on society, can you even imagine where we would be without them? They are great for communication, learning, and shopping. Computers have a large effect on people. Without computers, communication with co-workers, family, and friends would be nearly impossible. Social networking sites, such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4-In play a huge wrolein everyday life. These are the sites you use to access information from others to making plans for the weekend. Do you think that your children use the intrenet too much? Nowadays, that is their way to communicate with their peer. It makes them more social, which is a great quality to have in life. Also, I don'd know about you, but I have talked to many people around the world using the internet. It gives you the chance to experince other cultures. Communication was absolutely not as easy before having computers. It @MONTH1 seem hard to believe, but you can learn tremendous amounts @MONEY1 things from the internet. This @MONTH1 include learning about people. How would you video chat with someone without @CAPS5 or @ORGANIZATION2? You can learn a lot about a person from talking to the face to face, a thing that can't be done on a phone. Also, research for school could not be done without the internet. In a recent survey, @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM2 teenagers said that they use a search engine site, such as @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS6, or @ORGANIZATION3 at least once a day, @CAPS7 out @MONEY1 those @NUM1 said that it is for school. If it weren't for these search engines, children wouldn't be doing too great in school. Clearly, the computer provides ample ways to research and learn on a daily basis. It @MONTH1 sound rediculous, but in @DATE2, @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 shopping was done on the internet. If someone wants to start a business, their first stop is usually the internet. People are making @MONEY1 every year with the help @MONEY1 computers. People find it easiest to buy something with the click @MONEY1 a mouse. It is easier than the hassle @MONEY1 crowded malls and long lines. Also, do you remember when @CAPS8 @DATE1 was the time to put the alarm clock on for @NUM4 @CAPS9? Well, how people do @CAPS10 shopping online, there are hundreds, even thousands @MONEY1 sites that offer great sales. Now think about how purchasing items would be if it weren't for the internet. It's not agreat image, is it? As you can tell, computers have affected our lives in a great way. Communication, learning, and even shopping have become much simpler.

1361	1	"In modern society, @CAPS3 is rare that you come across someone who doesn't know how to basicly operate a computer. According to the statistics project known on youtube as ""shift happens"", most children in the @LOCATION1, @PERCENT1 in facts, have used a computer by age four. While @CAPS3 can be debated that computers are bad, i firmly disagree. Computers are one of the best technological advances the human race has made. they have helped education, reconnecting, and are even at times good for the environment. I wonder why people disagree, and i hope that after reading this, you will too. At my schoo, there are three computer labs, each with about twenty five computers, a library with twenty computers, and each teacher has two computers in their classroom. Wheni look at these amounts and addit to what i know about computers in other @CAPS1 schools, @CAPS3 is clear to me that computers have helped the education system. Many teachers can have students research projects with the click of a button. There are websites where students who were out from school can get their assignments for the next day. Also, teachers can put their grade books in their had drive. This saves paper and ensures accuracy in the final grade. As a student, i think that computers have greatly improved schools in many ways, but mostly in those above. At one point or another in life, we are all older and want to reconnect with our old friends. Thanks to computers, the process of reconnecting is much easier. There are social networks such as facebook, twitter, and @CAPS2, that are valuable for finding your friend from @DATE1 camp. Let's say you have been connected with someone, and you've just found out that you got a promotion. You want to call, but you don't know the hone number, but you know the email address. Email messages send instantly to anywhere. (And while you're at @CAPS3, ask for a phone number!) @CAPS3's always great to talk with old friends. Computers have helped @LOCATION1 make that easier. My friend recently purchased a sony laptop. She liked not only the features, but that @CAPS3 was an energystar, or eco-friendly. Now a days, computers have been made green in the battle for the environment. Paper is saved with online encylopedias, newspapers, journals, etc. Not only that but computers are needing less and less electricity. You save green and are green! Today's society is helping mother nature not only in our actions, but in computers too. In my opinion, computers are helping @LOCATION1, not hurting @LOCATION1. They have assisted education, social reconnecting and the environment. We must look kindly upon the advancement and miracle invention known as the computer."	5	5		10																					
1365	1	"Dear Newspaper, I think that when kids or even adults get computers, then they would not use it for good causes. When people get computers they spend more time inside and on them. They need to get outside get some exercise. Even little things like, if your going to your friends house, then take a jog there instead of your bike. When people spend more time on their computers than talking to your freinds, then they will be low on socializing and, after awile won't know how to communicate with people. All they would have to do is set a time limit on their computer and only use it for work otherwise. Computers could also be used for good things. If you have a project for school and need to type it up on the computer or find pictures on the internet then the computer would be a good resource. If you have a job for working with computers or fixing computers, then you would spend a lot of time on your computer. It also lets you interact with people on the othe side of the world. You can also learn about interesting facts or places. Computers could also be used for bad reasons. When people use it they could just use it to play this cool new video game they got. This can lead them into getting obese. They can also use it for sexual harrasment for stalking people. People can also use it for horrible things like selling or buying drugs or illegal things. So as you can see computers aren't safe in a lot of ways. I hope you can read and understand all the important facts explaining my reasons and consider them. Thank you and have a good day."	4	4		8																					
1367	1	"Dear @CAPS1 I would like to inform the public that using computers isnt so bad. The first reason I think make computers good is because of the people we can meet via @CAPS2, yahoo, @ORGANIZATION1 or gmail. For instance we could meet someone from @LOCATION1 and learn about his or hers culture or beliveths. My second reason I think computers help people is because what if someone didnt have @CAPS3 or the newspaper he or she could get the @CAPS4 news via nbc.com or fox.com and will be able to still find out whats going on in the world."	3	3		6																					
1371	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I feel that negative effects of computers on people is much greater than the positive effects. Computers have caused a massive amount of obesity in the @LOCATION1 and that number is growing everday. Computers can also be time-consuming and people could spend hours and even days on a computer without doing anything else. Lastly, computers can be dangerouis to many kids and could even end up in death. I feel that xomputers are too harmful for society and should be stopped. Obesity is @CAPS4 of the biggest problems in the @LOCATION1 and is growing bigger everyday. Over @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 population is obese and computers have been a major conributer. Put yourself in the mind of a computerf addicy. It is dinner time and you are hungry, but you don't want to lose too much time off of your computer. You hurry down to the nearest fast-food store and by yourself a cheeseburger, fries, and a soda. You then go back to your house and eat the food while on your computer. Not only is the fast-food bad for you, but you dont even give your body a chance to burn @CAPS7 those calories and carbohydrates that you just ate by exercising. Computer addicts do this almost everyday and before they know it, they are. @NUM1 pounds!

So should we keep using computers for the good of our society, or not use computers to exercise more? Computers are helpful to us by doing work that has to be done neatly. It also helps by accessing and surfing the internet to more useful stuff. A computer is very intelligent and not only can came in a boring, heavy, boxed shape. Computers are also in some electronics. If you go on vacation and forget to turn off the lights, you can use your hand held computer to turn it off. Communication is pretty easy on a computer. All you need is computer (of course), a microphone or headset, some speakers, and a special software. After you have all of these, you can connect with the rest of the world! Talk to loved ones or family members through your computer. If you want, you can also get a web cam. A video camera used on your computer. Then you can see others face to face! If you do not have anything what I just said, there is also texting. Just use your computer keyboard to type and send a message. Your computer can also a lot more things.

1385	1	"Did you know that in a recent poll in the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 use computers everyday? Computers have a very positive effect on people, such as informing them on news, traffic, and weather right away, interacting with others, and learning new facts. Can you even imagine how difficult life would be without computers? They are a daily tool that millions of people use positively. One way that people use computers positively is by using it to be informed by news, traffic, and weather. For example, say there are signs of a hurricane going to hit near their homes. they would know righ away just by clicking on the internet. Another example is if there was a shooting nearby. People would be well aware of the facts by reading an article online. Computers help by informing people about danger so they and their families are not harmed not only doe computers help inform people about any danger through news and weather, but @CAPS4 their daily lifestyle. My father drives into work every morning, and is always looking online for any traffic updates so he can avoid them and get to work on time and safely, without computers people would be unable to know directly the harms and difficulties they @MONTH1 face. Another positive affect computers have on people, is letting them interact with others, such as video chatting and instant messaging @PERCENT2 of the world video chats and instant messages. It helps to make people more social, by chatting with their friends. Another example is, say you haven't seen a close family member or friend in a long time. Video chatting and instant messaging will help you catch up and develop a stronger realationship nobody wants to waste time in life not speaking for a long period of time to a close friend or family member, right? Computers help people by interacting with others throughout their daily lifestyle. A third positive effect computers have on people is teaching them new things. Students' main source for education is through the computer on the internet. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""Computers are what helps my students grow. I have them use computers everyday for reports and to extend their learning"". They are @CAPS4 helpful to students because the internet now contains textbooks they use in class. That way, the won't need to lug around heavy books, and strss out for forgetting them, @CAPS4, if the student doesn't understand material learned in class, they can look online for extra help and guidance, malking their knowledge grow further. Without computers, lives wouldn't be the same in a negative way. Computers help people know news, traffic weather directly, interact with people, and learn new things. therefore, computers are very positive, since @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 use them now positively, why stop?"	4	5		9

1398	1	"Dear @CAPS1, Some people say that computers are fun, smart, and do no harm. Is that true though? Do computers make harm? Well, for one thing, I know that computers can take up! a lot of peoples time. For example, many people don't go outside as much. This is because most people are usually on their computers. What are they doing on the computer you ask; well lets, find out. There are many things a person can do on a computer. It can be fun chatting, educational or hard working. A lot of people use a computer for fun. For example, many people use the computer to chat with their friends. There are many sites to chat with friends. That can usually take up a lot of peoples time. A lot people can talk for hours on the computer and that is what takes up their time instead of going outside. Another example is the games that people are playing.To me, the computer games are one of the biggest problems. This is because a lot of the games can be to much fun, that it can be find a game and play it all the time. This can not only take up their time outside, but it can ruin their life. The game can be so addictive that kids and adults might not get their work done. That can cause failure in school or getting fired at work. On the other side though, a lot of people use a computer for work and school. Beside internet chating and computer games, many people use computers for school and at work. People type their work up or they send work to their e-mail to bring home. This is a good thing about computers, but also a bad thing. It is a good thing because now people can get their work done faster. This is a bad thing because it is another reason to stay inside.For work, people depend on computers. They save work on their and they use computers to build things. For exemple, people use a computer to program a robot. Although they use computers for a good reason people should make time for outside. A lot of people need to take breaks off the computer: because computers can do harm. This is because if they spend all their time on the computer they can get sick. Going outside, exercizing and getting fresh air is very important. So people out there, get off your computer. Stop chatting, pause your game, take a break from your work, and go outside. Enjoy the nature. Most of your day should not be on the computer. Thank you for your time. "	5	4		9

Computers allow someone from a faraway place to talk to another person who they can’t see in person, they allow you to get work done in a quicker manner. And get a college education without leaving your home. Imagine that you have a relative who lives a great deal of miles away from you and it’s too expensive to call or fly over there. Computers enable us to communicate with them through email or video chat without the hefty price. Because of computers, talking to your faraway family is a few clicks away. Getting work done can sometimes feel like another chore. Computers only make doing your work easier and faster. Would you rather sit and write out a term paper for hours or type it up and email to your in half the amount time college students find that computers get them efficiently than writing by hand. Computers are way to burdens of work. Education is an of all need, but what if the college that you want to attend is too far from home and you can’t afford to move in ? Thankfully, online college courses are available. If it wasn’t for this source of technology, you would be left to do what? Online courses allow an eager student to learn without breaking their bank or leaving their child if they are parents. Without computers, everyone would not be able to get the education that they have a right to. Computers have allowed us to communicate with our family that live somewhere we can’t afford to travel to. These technological devices have enabled to us to get our work done in a timely matter to receive the grade that we deserve. Computers have allowed over @NUM1 citizens to get their education right in their home at a price they can afford.

I fear that many kids will suffer from child hood obeasity, this is because of the inactiveness of so many teenagers my age. They @CAPS1 could be enjoying life outdoors and staying active, but they choose to sit infront of a screen all day, everyday. Researchers have proven inactiveness is at large due to many, facebook, mysape and twitter users. These websites are nothing but trouble, other than being unhealthy, teenagers all over are being cyber bullied, to the verge of suicide. Many are not aware of the several pedifiles and creepos these sights carry, which can lead to abduction, rape or worse. By staying active and being outdoors with your friends could save you from these dangers. Go outside run a little, you would be amazed how much a little exercise can help you. Also I firmly believe time should be spent with your family, doing family activities and eating dinner with your parents. By doing this you become closer as a family, and it could help you make healthier choices keep exercise. I believe by following these simple steps, staying active, staying off the computer and spending time with the family. Is much more beneficial than learning how to type, or talking to your friends. Using the computer leads to cyber bulling, and dangerous people, living healthy is the way to be."	4	3		7

1419	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have reason to believe that computers and other similar modern technologie is breaking up the world we once were. Things such as computers are a main cause of @CAPS3 lacking exercise, interaction with family and friends, and is also a possible danger to ones mental health. The leading cause of obecity and an outrageous amount of overweight people in @LOCATION1, is the fact that people spend way to much time on computers, and not excersizing. I have recently found out that in the @DATE1's the average familly had one computer (sometimes none). Nowadays, the average familly has up to @NUM1, @NUM2, or even more! Furthermore, the percentage of obese peoples has sky rocketed since then, because people are almost always on the computer, rather than exercising like they should be. A major reason that modern technologie has hur t our nation, is that there is an immence lack of communication and interaction between families. Families are fighting/arguing more often, and spouses getting in divorces because they never get to spend time together. Studies have shown that nowadays @NUM3 of @NUM1 marages ends in a divorce, where as in @DATE2, it was @NUM3 of @NUM6. Advances in technologie have astoundingly increased since then, and people are on the computer/phones/other @CAPS4 which is separating families everywhere. When impubesent children are trying to grow and expand their minds, all they are doing is sitting on the computer, and not getting the brain nutrition they need. The students in schools today are the future leaders of the world. Now the parents should be thinking, if they want their children to do well, or exeed their expectation in life, then they should not be sitting on the computer all day filling their-heads with nonesence. Now, computers do have the abillity to be educationally usefull, but do children use them that way? The answer in no, and, ""@PERCENT1 of the time, neither do adults"", state @PERSON1 from the @ORGANIZATION1. I hope you can agree on the fact that computers are causing more bad than good in familes all around the world. People are not getting the amount of exercise they need, aren't interacting with family enough, and these computers can become harmfull to the mental health of future generations. If famillies can minimize the amounts of computer-drawn activities, then I think parents all over the world can modify themselves about their childrens health."	5	5		10																					
1422	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 is your opinion on computers? Are they good or bad? Computers, have not been around that long but it is contrivertal wiether it has a positive or negative effect. True they do help people research certain topics but they are also hazardous. I believe computer are not a neccesity to people. Computers are uneeded because people spend way to much time on them, then we begin lack exercise, and they become hazardous to everyone. First, computers are not a neccesity because people send way to much time on them. Once you are on a computer for over an hour to an hour -and-a-half the computer will start to effect you in negative ways. For one your eyes will begin to hurt. If you stay on longer than that you will start to get a head-ach. Soon your head-ach wil turn so bad you cant bare it. It will pound and feel as if its on fire. This happens because your brain cannot take in the brightness of the computer and @CAPS2 your reading or seeing at the same time. Most of the time this happens eventually you will lock yourself in time a darkroom to rest. Sometimes you don't get off till they have a stomach-ach too. After they get off and feel better they go back on to repeat the process. This is why, computer are an obstruction to us. Next, people begin to lose exercise. After being on the computer for so long all they have time to do is eat, sleep, and go to work or school. Computer have deprived everyone of the outside. They don't want to go out and get exercise and play around. Living in those conditions can only lead to one thing, obysity. Soon you will become fat. Life will become tough. And being fat also has a negative effect. For one you cannot run very long, you become weak, and for kids you stop growing. But the worst is you will not live as long as you would if you were healthy. So you see computers are a nucence to our society. Finally, computers are hazardous to the envirnment. There are @NUM1 billion people in the world. At anytime about @NUM2 billion are on some sort of electronic device. When you are on a computer, have you ever noticed the hot air blowing out of the fan. Now, have you ever thought were this heat goes. Well, it makes holes in the ozon layer and causes global warning. The ozon layer is the only thing keeping the sun's ultra-violent rays from scorting us. Now if everytime some turns on a computer @NUM3 of the ozon layer disapeared and @NUM2 billion people are on that would be @NUM2 billion mm gone from our atmosphere. Now think about global warming. If the ozon layer is like a bubble, the heat is trapped inside. So this heat will eventually heat up the earth. This will cause the @CAPS3 to melt and then the sea will rise. The @CAPS3 has enough water in it to flood the earth. Do you reall want that. Eventually we would drown and life would seece to exist. As you can see computer are a nucents. They hypnotize the young children and adults. They be helpful but more hazardous. Sometimes we don't even relize this. Computers are bad because people spent to much time on them, people lose exercise, and they are hazardous to us."	3	5		8																					
1430	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you think computers have a positive or negative effect on people? In my opinion, I would say that computers have negative effects on us. This is because we would get less exercise, less time to enjoy nature, and interacting with family and friends. If your on the computer most of the time at home, how would you get your exercise? You wouldnt because the whole time you would be stuck sitting down at the desktop. This is also a proble because this is how obeseity can occur from no exercies, and just sitting all day. Or people who have heart problems nad need exercise can worsen by being distracted by the computer. Being home on the computer does not let you enjoy nature. Instead of going outside in the warm wheather, having fun people are staying home. This is not good because they should be out having fun, not on the computer all day. Missing time with family and frinds is unexeptable when your on the computer. This is because yar supposed to keep your family and friends company and not daze off on what your doing on the computer. Also you miss family gatherings or leave yar friends lonley. Thats because yar to busy on the camourar nad not paying attention to anyone arand you. This is why I think computers have a negative effect on people. This is because of less exercise, less time to enjoy nature, and interacting with family and friends."	4	4		8

You log on to your many accounts, open some chat boxes with your friends & start researching for your project. As more & more people log on to technology, they seem to come out with new things for computers. Some people are missing out, & dont see the negatives, like social relationships failing, procrastinatting, lack of learning & more! Beep! one new @CAPS2 message. On the computer you can talk to your friends & family, but sometimes people are on so much that in real life relationships fail. You cant type a @ORGANIZATION1 message or hide your feelings behind a screen. Also for kids when they get older, many jobs require customer service, and if you only are good at talking to people on the computer, it cant help you. Whatever you say on the internet can be read & posted anywhere, any site, any time, whereas in real life its really you talking. School are learning are very important too, but sometimes I know I have homework but procrastinate and say ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 do it later, i need to check this out!"" putting my learning to a stop. Some people dont like school, but its very important in a persons life if you like to be successful, you need to balance school, learning, computer time, and dont forget exercise & possibly work! Computers can be helpful with research & guides, but facebook or twitter is going to slow you down. So buckle down start that research! Chatrooms, @ORGANIZATION2, email and other things can be harmful to you. There are many predators out there who are just waiting for anybody to log on. Its very dangerous, and someone can pretend to be someone there not. Also, computer all day with no exercise can lead to obesity, and sometimes your hands posture can give you carpal tunnel syndrome. There are many bad things that result from computers. Many times in your life youll need to find a balance. Dont overlook the negative or you could get hurt.

1438	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3't it about time we start thinking more about the digital age. Computers has contributed so much to society for many years and up to this point I don't believe the world would be able to function without it.Some people say that computers @CAPS3't good for society but do they really believe that computers gave us the internet, email, most jobs depend on the internet, even games, and many more let me explain. First of all without computers there would be no internet and without that many jobs would fail. Most jobs need the internet to work like architects need the computer to design buildings and houses. Almost every office has computers for many different reasons. Writers need the computers to wright books, if they were hand writen some people might not be able to read it, so if there was no computers thousands of people would loose their jobs. My mothers works on a computer she would loose her job. Not only that but we need computers for school. If I had to write a paper on a person it would be almost impossible to do without looking up information about him on the internet. Also with writing a paper, some teachers only exept typed papers. How are we suppost to do that if we didn't have computers that makes home work a lot easier. Lastly, computers lets us explore new places. Goole @LOCATION1 is a map of every place on @LOCATION1 that we can see. If you need to find out where something is you can always count on the internet. If you need direction you can print them out off the internet. Also if you need to find out what somthing means instead of using an dictionary use the computer. Now can you see how much the computer benefits society. Some people say that other people take too long on the computer but you don't have to. I don't know any one that uses the computer for more then work or school."	4	5		9																					
1439	1	"Dear local newspaper, I am sure you will agree with me about keeping the computers in this world. I am sure you will agree with me about keeping the computers in this world because computers help everyone in their education. For example when i don't understand some words i go to the computer type www.dictionary.com. Then i words that i don't understand. After that the definition comes up and in a faster time because when i look in the dictonary i take about @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes to just find a word but on the computer it takes me @NUM3 seconds. Also computers let us chat and send massages when we can't see or take to a person so we send massages and the receive the message them they send back a message. Lastly computers help on english class like on spelling, writing, typing, editing & revising. That's why i think we should keep computers in this world. I know everyone doesn't know everything. Computers could help us in math, by using formilas and a calculator on calculator.com. Also computers help in science, by going to @LOCATION1 and asking questions like, ""what is matter or what are . Finally i am gonna talk about not understanding some words. I always go to dictonary.com so that website could give and help understand the word and get the real definition. I always use these @NUM2 websites when i am stuck in math or science or in english. Those websites could help a lot in our education. That's my way of thinking about the computers helping us in our education. My parents are always staked about me talking to my friends and hanging out with them. So, when i can see or talk to my friends i go myspace or facebook or msn to talk and send messages to my friends. We just keep chating and sending can messages because our parents don't let us hang out. Mostly everyone does the same. I do we could also send much other pictures, music and lot more. That's my opinion of why we should have comuters because we need to chat or send messages. At the end you know we all need to type our essays, lesson and more. The computers help use make power points they check our spelling, the could also change why we wright like cursive and more, they also help in editing & revising. I always keep sending words wrong. So the computer help me on spelling it also makes your project look better. That's why i think"	5	5		10

Also, they have enable us to create a @CAPS2 age in research. In addition, computers have given us amazing @CAPS2 ways to entertain ourselves computers have a incredibly positive effetct on people. One reason why computers have such a positive effect on humans, is that we have developed many @CAPS2 ways to communicate with people all over the world. First, one fantastic program such as @CAPS5 (instant messaging) has given us the amazing ability to hold a conversation with one or more people any where in the world, and be able to respond within an instant. In a recent survey @PERCENT1 of people said that they prefer instant messaging over any other type of communication beside face to face talking, second, most computers come with webcams built in now, so you can actually see the person you are communicating with. I had friend move recently, and we are able to see what each other are doing and remain friends even though we don't live in the same town, and I'm sure a similar experience has occured to you or someone you know. Finally, the popular program of facebook has changed communication forever. People can now see things go on in your info whereever want. Although some it has a wonderful computers have established incredible ways of communication. A second reason computers positively import people is that they have created a numerous research. One example would be our phenomenon search engine, google. Google to almost everything with help people in finding schools now use computer resources such us @CAPS6 which allow in research to the fact that there is so much availbale on the. In addition, computers have created many opportunities for people to learn more because of the billions of web you in existance studies have shown that @PERCENT2 of people have found a website conataining information relevant to their research that was than a book. Computer are the reason that research has contuined to thrive and @CAPS2 continue to be made. Finally, computers have established amazing @CAPS2 entertainment for people of all ages. First, video websited such as youtube have created a place for people to watch music videos and creative films just to enjoy themselves. If you can't get tickets to a concert you want going online to watch music videos by that person is a much cleaper alternative, second, jaming websites are a less expensive, but if you go online you can play similar games at no charge. Finally websites with appropriate funny stories posted on them are a fantastic way to get the laughter of a comic, without leaving your couch wouldn't you prefer to stay home, rather than going out when it isn't necessary? computers are an incredible way to achieve quick, un expensive entertaiment in todays economy. In conclusion, computers impact proper in many positive ways. they're established now forms of communication, research and entertainment that will forever change society. Therefore, I invite you to join me to demonstrate the icrredible strenght of computers."	6	6		12																					
1453	1	"Dear local newspaper, I have recently saw that you think that people are spending way too much time on computers instead of excercising or hanging with their friends and family. Well I think the opposite of that opinion. People interact with people online if the want to. People can also learn new things. Plus computers help people make money. So read on to hear more. Most people that use computers are interacting with people someway somehow. @PERCENT1 of all people have either a facebook, a myspace, a skype, or all three. on any of those sites you interact with people. We can meet new people on the internet. Like people on the other side of the state or country. Also we hear about what is going on in our big or small town. Like for instance if there was a missing child we know the description, so we could help find him or her. Not only do people interact bu people can research useful information. For an example, one day I was told do a project on teen mothers. I went straight to the library I took some books out and whatever I couldn't find in the books. I went to the computer for. Also we can learn about faraway places like @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1. My mom always says, ""@CAPS1 your room or @CAPS2 going to give your stuff to people in need."" @CAPS3 the first time she said that to me I went to the computer to see how other people were having to me. Some were good, nice, big houses but tyen others lived in boxes and trash cans. That changed me big time, I felt really had for those people. Lastly computers help people make money and support their family. @PERCENT2 of all people found out about their job on a computer. Theycan go to websites to find good safe jobs that makes good money. Plus if you have a computer you can easily work from home. Some people dont have the money for babysitters so have to watch their kids all day so have to work from home to make money. Finally people can apply for jobs or even community service online. My sister, @PERSON1, got her first job by going on the @CAPS4 museums website and applying right there on the computer. Therefore computers are good. I say this because people can interact with other people online, people can research useful information, and finally computers help people find jobs and make money.

1460	1	"I have relized that there as been a disagreement about computers the positive and negative effects on people. It seems to me, in my opinion that computers have more of a negative affect on people than positive. I believe tat people are spending too much time on the computer and not exercizing, they don't spend quality time with family & friends and need to get fresh air and enjoy nature. Although computers are a great piece of techology, many don't get outside to enjoy the nature & fresh air because their computers are inside their homes. This is not good because when you go outside, it helps skin health from the sunlight & lets in fresh air for your lungs. In addition, a walk outside to enjoy nature wouldn't hurt either. It can relieve stress & can be relaxing. Furthermore, it is obvious when people are on the computer, they usually block out what their friends & family are saying to them. People can lose track of time & be on the computer for hours. Instead you should use this time to be with your friends and family. Being with your family can make your bond between each other stronger and you can get along with each other better. Also, having a nice family time is a good way to help be with your family. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 experts say that eating a family dinner can help a child's grades & prevent them from using drugs or dropout of high school or college. Finally, kids are more obese than us because they don't get enough excersize. At least @PERCENT1 or more kids are obese from recent studies. Due to this; this can lead to bone & joint issues, heart diseaase, lung problems, diabetes and athsma. These issues above are serious health problems if not treated. If kids excercize instead of being on a computer all day, the number of obese kids will drop drastically. Excersize can help kids' self esteem, and get them back in shape. They can either play sports or even take a walk or run. There are many different things you can do to excersize and its fun for kids. Unquestionably, there is definitely more reasons why there is a negative affect on kids/adults due to computers for the reasons above and more. Computers prevent people from enjoying nature to get fresh air. Likewise, they also prevent families & friends to spend time with each other and lastly, it isnt allowing kids to excersice which can lead to obesity."	5	5		10																					
1483	1	"To: @CAPS1 this letter concerns, Computers are apart of our daily life. You can do many things on them such as play games, watch videos, search the web, and even communicate with people from all over the world. They are very useful for people who go to school bacause you can complete and save work for your classes. Sure maybe some people are addicted to the computer but others use it only when they need to. Computers have a massive affect on some peoples life. Sitting around on the computer all day can be harmful but informative in many ways. One of the informative ways is that you learn new information every time you log on. That is why I think the computer has a great effect on people."	3	3		6

Children are going on the @ORGANIZATION1 instead of doing there homework. Maybe perhaps a fmaily member is dieing and you rather spend time on the @ORGANIZATION1 instead of with that family member. all of this things are happening because of the computers everyone is getting. This can not be true! That over @PERCENT1 of the people inNew @CAPS1 say that they are putting on a lot of waight and turning obeast. I asked them what do they think is this to happen. Someone named @PERSON1 said the reason is the computers there taking over people lifes. The computers is the enomy of the people that it is a affecting most in life. Me as a child a @ORGANIZATION1 is throwing me off of my homework. I use to have A's and b's on my report card only. Right now it turned in to @CAPS2 and @ORGANIZATION1's are changing my life drastikly but not in a good way. As you know it your child could be going threw, the same terible things as me. You should start to check there homework instead of them just going on there @ORGANIZATION1 and forgetting all about there work life I did. Try and provent this. running down your face and feeling disaponted in your self. The one you love good past u way and you did not even spend time with he or she. Wanse again the thing that is called @ORGANIZATION1 did this. The disigen that you made because of the @ORGANIZATION1 would and is going to scare you for life. We the people that have computers would find out that they were never made for a good purpose just to distray what we do and how we spend times with are familys and friends. Turn your head and say no to the one thing that would reck you into little peases. How do you feel? I feel bad because I let something so little mess up my life. You still have time to change your life and say no to the computers. They could make you turn obeast because you are not getting enoff exersice. The one you love could be messing up because of the @ORGANIZATION1 that you have in your house. The worst thing of all you were not able to spend time with the family member that you love the most. The computers that we have are missing your life us you no it up. Just say no to the computers and live your life the best way that you could.

First of all, having less time exercising is not good because @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people ent up fighting obesscicley. ""You don't want to be one of those people trust me"" said @PERSON1. Second, enjoying nature is a good thing to do instead of playing with a computer because you get your daily dose of air by enjoying nature. ""You also have a lot of fun"" said @LOCATION1.

1495	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I agree with the experts that people spend to much time on the computer, people should be exercising, reading, or spending time with friends and family. But people are so lazy and would rather be sitting and doing something on the computer and if they dont start doing other things instead of being online they could become overweight. My first reason why people should spend less time online is because people need to exercize. Seriously people should be taking walks around the block or going to the gym or even playing a sport instead of playing on the computer all day and doing nothing and without exercising you will become overweight and lazy. My second reason why I think people should spend less time online is because you should be spending time with your friends and family not ignoring them because your doing something on the computer. Thats just rude, so why dont you go and have a family game night or go out to eat with your family and you could also watch a movie, go skating, or even go to the park with your friends because thats a lot more fun than being online all day. My last reason why people should spend less time online is because everyone should have time to just read a good book honestly just walk down to your local library and check out a book because reading is way better for your brain than doing stupid stuff on the computer. So in conclusion, in my opinion I think people should spend less time online is because if you dont get enough exercize you can become over weight and lazy, and not spending a lot of time with your friends and family is just rude and reading is very good for you unlike staying on the computer, well that is all I have to say for now."	4	4		8																					
1497	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Are you aware that more than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 families have ownership to a computer? Maybe so, but, were you informed that at least half of that @PERCENT1 have family issues or such related The issue in bond is if computers have a possitive effect or negetive effect on mankind. In @CAPS4 opinion, I feel that this invention @MONTH1 be is taking a negetive toll on society. I say this because now-a-days there are inappropriate websites that children should veiw, and it takes away time with family. But mainly because of the recent @CAPS3 issue. Without a doubt, youngsters such as are expertly and a website, we'll just do as we were told and on maybe we could find one by an accident. Who knows? All I know is, there too many to count adult websites that children from the ages of @DATE1 log on to everyday. This is unacceptable on a person why we should be prohibited in computers. No responsible parent would be caught dead with a @NUM1 year old on an adult website and computers make it harder such parents to do so. With such experience computers take away time with and when I had @CAPS4 computer, @CAPS4 always now we never spent time with her. She said the other day do I peel bananas,"" if i never got out on the computer, you would be right now,"" she was right. Whenever @CAPS4 brother and I got on the computer we'll stay in the all day. But every we've been together much @CAPS4 now and I feel that computers have a negetive effect on society is because of the recent @CAPS3 I was called to the office one day to be informed that a crew on @CAPS3 com had befriended me and they were using boys and girls for drugs and prostitution. People take advantage of computers and end reading peoples infos. This could have been prevented but it wasnt. Now it's your chance, I hope you will feel the same way as me when it comes to the negetives and positives of computers. But remember, computers have keep more websites that aren't good for young kids, it takes away time from family, but mainly because of the recent @CAPS3 issue."	4	5		9																					
1500	1	"Dear local Newspaper editor, More and more people are using computers, but not everyone thinks that is such a good idea. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Other experts disagree. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because they let you learn about anything all over the world, they let you talk online with other people, and teach hand eye coordination. I think that computers are very helpful. Dont you love having the oppritunity to research anything from any part of the world that you want to learn about? I'm sure that everyone who has a computer does. With computers, you can use search engines like, google, yahoo, ask, and so many more. I know that computers help me with research all the time when I do projects or write papers for school. The internet is a great, reliable that you cango to when researching a topic for shcool or even just looking for an answer to a simple question. My next reason is that computers let you talk to other people online. Things like facebook, email, myspace, and web-caming all let you communicate with people anywhere in the world. For example, I have an aunt that lives in @LOCATION1, and on christmas me and my family used my cousins webcam to see her and talk to her when we couldnt be with her on a special holiday. Also, things like facebook and myspace let you put up pictures and chat with friends and family all over the world. My last reason why I think computers have a positve effect on people is that playing on the computer is a good leisure time activity. There are all kinds of fun games you can play, and some even let you compete with other people around the world. For example, internet checkers is a game that lets you compete against someone else. There are so many websites that let you pick games you want to play out of a huge selection. Its obvious that computers have a positive effect on people for research, talking to friends & family and leisure activities. I hope you agree with me!"	4	4		8																					
1505	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 of the students and staff members of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 school find computers verry important. Computers not only help people in school but at home too. I know that the readers of this artical will agree that computers are verry helpful, they teach us about people and things far away, and they are great for chating online! Most people use compoters every day! Computers are verry helpful tools in every day life. They always have a program that if you spell something wrong it corrects you. Computers even have websites of a dictionary were people can look up words. I know this is verry helpful because my brother is writing his collige essays and their are no colliges that will be impressed by a gramaticly incorrect essay. Computers also help you find things you need really fast, like food restrants and the closest malls, or even jobs! Not only do computers help people with spelling and jobs but they also can teach us about far away places. Computers can show and tell us of wonderful places beond what we have scean. A lot of normal societys familys have been on vacation before. To find an intriging place to go they can look it up on the world wide web. Even if a family cant go on a vacation they can still find from their computer cheeper closer things to do. When computers are beig used to find places and thing across the world and near you is they can also give teens the oppritunity to chat with their friends online. A lot of students in @CAPS3 hallow school have a facebook account. Most use this account to talk to their friends online. I also have a facebook and I use it almost everyday to talk to my cousin from @LOCATION1 that I havent scean sence I was @NUM3. But, computers arent just used for fun chating they can also be used for school blogs. In my language arts class we have a reading blog that every student has to participate in. This blog allows the class to not wast class time to talk about recently read books. In conclusion computers should be taken seriosly because they do help society. Computers help us every day, they teach us and they can be verry fun and eductional. Remember what @PERSON1 from the department of tecnolgey at @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""@CAPS5 can only get better if socitey accepts it."""	5	4		9

1511	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The computer has been a resource we have been using for years and gives you information and pictures but that doesn't mean people have to be on it all the time. People can talk some times with other people or go on the webcam to see a loved one who's in iraq but the need to go outside to exercise just to take a walk around the block. They don't even need to leave the house all the time just excercise to a tape or get a tredmill. Thats all people need to do instead sitting on thier butts all day move around. People becoming obease has risen because of lack of excercise so grab your shoes and go jog a couple blocks in your niehbor hood just do little things and you will feel much better than you were on your computer. Nature is all around us but most people don't noice because their on the computers. Which needs to end now these beautiful land marks across the world are being wasted because hardly any ones looking at them. Go to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, even @CAPS1 and get some fresh clean air thats not from your home you can go to the park to just look at the birds just see something without a screen on it. So go got your camera and go some where with wild life and have fun. Just doing these things will help your health, energy and your mind.

1519	1	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think that people are spending to much time on there computers and not exercising as they're supouse to do every day. @CAPS5 @CAPS3 says that @PERCENT1 of all people in the intere world are spending to much time on the @CAPS3 and not enjoying nature. So they don't get exercis like other people do. @CAPS5 @CAPS4 says that people that go out side and not stair at there computers will live a long and helthy life. I say that @PERCENT2 of all people that are always on the @CAPS3 often go blind and will never see who the world is changing awound them. I say that @PERCENT3 of all people that don't always go on the @CAPS3 will live a better life then the people that are always on the @CAPS3. My @CAPS5 told me that you should go on the @CAPS3 just not for a very long time because beeing on the @CAPS3 for a very long time is not so good for you so don't go on the @CAPS3 for a very long time only for a short amount of time and don't go on the @CAPS3 every day only like @NUM1 time a week. People that have @CAPS6 book acounts you shouldn't go on it like every day go on like @NUM1 to @NUM3 time a week because going on the @CAPS3 for a very long time is not good for people. My @CAPS5 @CAPS8 says that @PERCENT4 of all people in the world have @CAPS9 and ofthen go blind because of them using the @CAPS3 all the time and that if you go on it for to long your @CAPS3 will mealt down and brake.

1521	1	"I believe computers have a positive effect on people because computers can help people in many ways. You can e-mail friends from across the world, get important information you might need, and also you can do business online. Computers have fasinating things to show and inform. Most people that have computers can use them for e-mailing friends. Sometimes your closest friends are across the country & you want to talk to them. Why not e-mailing them on your computer? It would mean a lot to your friends it you just take time to say hello through e-mail. My second opinion on why using computers are a positive effect on people because. Some middle school through college & the rest of you life need to use computers. Maybe because of some important information they might need for an assignment from a teacher. Not all the time you can find certain things in books. Now a days computers are taking over books. My third opinion for computers is that some people are to ill to go to work so they work online. Even though you are ill you will still be getting paid because you are still working. So women just had a baby & she is using her computer to work online. So she can make money so she can support her femily. In conclusion, my opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people because they are used for e-mailing friends, finding out important information for school purposes or job purposes. My last opinion is that computers are used for working online. To me, I think computers are a positive effect on people."	4	4		8																					
1526	1	"Dear @PERSON1, To this day, there are many people who use telecommunication devices, like the computer. Some think computers have a posotive effect on people. Others are concerned that people spend too much time on them. I think that both these opinions are correct. Although using a computer can become an addicting and unhealthy habbit, they teach a person everyday about something, are enjoyable, and help save the earth. Using computers is something I know millions of people use everyday, and would think @CAPS2 would be difficult to live without. For example, my family owns four computers. We each have our own specific reasons for using them. For my mom, @CAPS2's usually working or checking her e-mails. For me and my sister, @CAPS2's researching and typing of homework, and communicating with our friends via facebook or. So say when my mom is working, or me and my sister are researching something we learn. Before these were computers, everyone used, but now that we have the internet, theres no really need to get a book. Most of the time people wont even have the book their looking either have to go out and buy get one from the library. Now this is an inconvenience to people, so why not use the internet thats quick, and. People also use computers to like I mentioned above with maybe facebook, @CAPS1, or e-mail.@CAPS2's quick, easy and fun. @CAPS2 also saves paper which helps the planet. We always use to send letters, but now with these sources, you don't need to much! Computers are also fun for kids because you can play a lot of games on bring. Now even though I mentioned all those good things, there are unfortunately bad ones too. So many people use computers everyday, and @CAPS2's bad for your physical and mental health. People spend so much time on them that they can get easily addicted. This means they will be on them all the time, and never do other things like go outside. They wasn't exercise which could be bad for their physical health. Also, staring at a screen all day is bad for your eyes, and brain. So I think, due to these causes, people shouldn't use them constantly. In conclusion, I'd like to say that people should use computers for learning things, go outside or do something active because spending all this time on computers can result in physical and mental health issues. Thank you and I hope you agree with my statements."	5	5		10

1532	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In many ways computers have been very useful to the human rare. They can been used to look up information, talk to family and friends music etc. Don't you think people are wasting more time on the computer instead of getting exercise. It's clear that computers can do just about anything want than to do. But why spend your time on the computer when you can spend time with your family. Playing sports, or getting some fresh air. I think computers have a positive effect on people and negative effect one of the positive effects is being able to talk to your friends. i know sometimes we are not able to see them as much in school. In my opinion I think it is a great way so you can catch up on funny times that you can and friends shared. Now here comes the negative effect. Mang kids get bulled and picked by other kids over the internet. This can cause other kids to have a low self esteem, and cause dangerous events in the future. When it comes to computer they have saved many people life. Some of these ways are finding cures to harmful deases. Computers have information when serious weather storms are coming and prepare us for the weather. Wouldn't you agree that computers have played a huge role in our lifes. Sometimes we she take a break from them and enjoy nature. So have fun with technology and don't forget to stay active too."	3	3		6																					
1537	1	"My opinion on computers is that I think it's a good idea for people to go on computers. I think this way because if you haven't seen someone for so many years then you got a chance to see that person or talk to that person through the computer. Computers are also good because if you have a project to do from school then you could get good information based on what project you have to do. I like to go on the computer to talk to my friends that I haven't seen a while you could also meet new people and make friends. If there wasn't computers then we would have to look through a lot of books for information, or go all the way to the bank to check your account balance, this is why I think computers are good ideas. On the computer you could see workouts to get fit we don't only have to go to the gym. My dad gose on the computer to talk to his sisters, or play games with other people arount the world. Another example I could use is my mom she talks to her family in @LOCATION1 and in other places too. If there wasn't computer's we couldn't our tests, we couldn't get information. I think computers are very good ideas, cause it's good when you got to pay your bills too. We could interact with friend and familys online too thats what a lot of tenns and aults do if there was a rainyday or if its snowing and we don't go the chance to see our friends or relitives. For some people they think it's not a good idea because some people get addicted to the computers, but there is so much that you could do that the computer won't get you board. Thats why I think that computers are a good idea and that they are very important."	4	4		8																					
1540	1	"@DATE1 @CAPS1 Local Newspaper, I think that computers have a huge affect on people. My thing about it is that the computer gets kids lazy and unactive. Having a computer will give kids the action to sit around and do nothing. I'm sure you've heard of websites such as myspace, facebook, formsping, etc. These websites can get a person to be willing to be on computer instead of exercising and staying healthy. I believe kids like me these day want to keep in touch with their friends. If the phone's not in the picture then the computer is. Also getting rid of the computer can stop the homosexuals from getting a hold of kids by acting their age. I will admit the computer can be useful but to be on all day that's just rediculous. I have a @NUM1 year old brother that stays on the computer from the time he gets til the time he goes to sleep. Compared to me he's not fit and healthy at all, that's what countless hours on the computer did to him. In fact he's on myspace so much that he has over @NUM2 friends and he doesn't even half of them he gives them his number and home address. Do you notice a lot of kids these days want to. can when you would rather waste the computer other than outside and at least self. I've always had a to football but I could @CAPS2 find the time to play with my brother. All they are about is chicks and of course the computer. I'm not asking to take away computer's in people's homes but put a stop to the daily number of hours spent on it because time is one thing that money can @CAPS2 buy. Some kids will look back to these days wondering how much time they wasted on nothing. long story short like life, dont spend it all on nothing."	4	4		8																					
1543	1	"Dear local newspaper @CAPS1 i think some peoples are not to much on the computers. Some peoples might be talk to their family members. To see if they are ok or if they are bad so they can know. How about if someone die in they family and they don't know notthing about that peoples. It might ben their parents, grandma, grandpa, aunts, uncles or it might ben one of their best friends. Some people also might be on their bank acount. To see if they can get out money fror the bank. Might also be sending money by going to the computer and be sending to their family members. They might be paying a bill by the computer. The money they own to that bank or they might be doing some thing eles. I also think people are useing the computer to much. Just like kids they go on the computer to just play games. That's not go for the little kid because if they keep going on the computers. They might not want to get away from the computer. Then parents will have so hard time calling their kids to go eat or to go to sleep. That's going to be a hard work to do. So i think some people should go outside to do exercis and enjoy the nature. I do beleve to people will go outside and do exercis, enjoy the nature, and spenting more time with their family. And thank you local newspapers. Some people are also now things about people are about some eles."	4	4		8

Also, who would want to get of their @CAPS2 and exercise, exercising is so boring and lame. Second, who would like to especially enjoy the nature, walking through the woulds is so boring, you'll be walking through mud, ticks will be all over body, mosquitoes will try and bite you when you sweat. When kids get older, they mostly don't want to interact or spend time with their family, they want to spend time with their friends everyday. Also, they mostly want to use technology to. Kids will spend time texting on their cellphones when they're not in the mood for calling. Thirdly, computers do give you hand-eye coordination it teaches you how to type without looking down at the keyboard. Computers also teach you how to set you fingers on the home row for the keyboard. Finally, @CAPS2 really do benefit society because you can use this technology in middle school, high school, and through college. When you get older you'll be learning more about these kinds of technology. Also, kids could teach their parents how to use computers if their parents don't know how to.

I believe people using computers does benifit society because scientists use computers every day, to make the plans to send a ship into space or to keep progress of an experiment. Computers help people stay organized. A lot of teens and kids use their computers to shop and stay in touch with friends. Some people belive people spend to much time on computers. That @MONTH1 be true, but also remember what its doing for society. When people spend less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends its a personal choice. Its not like their being obliged by the @ORGANIZATION1."	3	3		6																					
1563	1	"Computers, one of the daily things we use and @CAPS1 with. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on the awesomeness of the computers! I love computers but, I as a teen know about managing your time on the computer. You cannot sit there and waste your time on the computer. The amount of time wasted on your computer could be the time you might be outside haveing fun. Theres lots of things you could do outside! As for some exsamples: @CAPS1 come ball, run around, go to the park, go exploring etc... Friends and family are very entertaining, I have lots of friends and I love them all! If you have some spare time you should hang out with them and have some fun, go to the mall! I always go to the mall with my friends insted of playing on the computer for hours on end. So get of the computer and go @CAPS1! Have some fan in the sun today."	3	3		6																					
1565	1	"Dear, local newspaper people @CAPS1's lot of computer that have help us with are planet. Like not letting us dive are cars for stuff. Learninging was easyer for every one with computers too. Then have comunications with people with computers. We should hate a box the has information in it, we should be glad we have something like that in are home. Why we don't need-in us cars sometimes if you have a computer. Like some people have desided that can have @CAPS1 own busniss so they us the computer to make one. Then if you don't want to waste time driveing to buy a te-shirt you can just go on the computer and buy one. Next the more we drive the more polution git in are atmisphier. If we did not have computers are planet will get @PERCENT1 more pulluted. Each year. Now do you want that to happen to the world? Last, we wont be wasting gas on are cars because we are using computers. If the computer was taken away people will still choose the lasy way and just drive cars. Learning is easyer for every one with computers like we don't have to look in a book to find something. Then @CAPS1 different learning programs to teach us a different language. Like for lots of people have college for people who did not. Last, it can help us do are homework if we have on it. I realy my second brain, it has . Now lot of. Third, communication are going to be a hole lot with computers. Say you dont have and you to send a lot. The computer to help you, it will allow you to talk to, then you can talk to other people like the japaness who know english so you now how @CAPS1 life is to yours. You can ask people question. Or just for fun you can play mind game with other people. I got to do alot of chating with my old friend by this and I miss them but if the only way I can talk to them with out my parents yelling at me bacause the phone bill is so high. The greater or go of a computer make us know we don't have do that many stuff. Like polute are air. Then we can learn fast without a book. Last, to alow us to talk to my old friend, so can every one beleve me that the computer is not that bad."	4	4		8																					
1566	1	"Hello my name is @PERSON1 @CAPS1 and I am going to enforce you that computers can benefit our society. First, @CAPS3 allows students to easily get good grades on projects and reports. Second, You can make online job applications. Lastly, computers allow people to chat with other people. Firstly, the computer allows your children who are also students to do better on their projects and reports. They help children's reports because for example they are doing a report on ""@CAPS2 lincon"" they have access to look up the peron to get information they need right at home. Doing reports with their computer there is no need to use up your projects you can also look up information and print out pichers to make your project more vibrant and eye-catching to younger people. Also @CAPS3 allows you to type your information to make @CAPS3 look orginzed and neet. Accordly, if you are trying to find some job applications without wasting your time, just look on the internets. This way you want go to place not knowing if jobs are available and seeing none. Also @CAPS3 save your to save the trip out there. You are able to look up the paying of the job and regulations, and you can find out if you get the job fastered. Lastly, @CAPS3 allows socializing. For example like facebook or/and myspace lets you talk to friends from school or friends you met online. For adult who don't have a myspace or facebook account they can use email, msn, aol, aim/aol instant messager, or via chat. This way adults can catch up on work and children can kee in touch with friends or/and family. This is why @CAPS3 think computer with internet benifit our society projects, reports, job appicatrone and spcializing with family and friends."	4	4		8																					
1571	1	"In my own opinion I think that people should get less time on computers more time exercising, enjoying, nature, and interacting with family and friends. If people spend time on computers they will not get off and be stuck on computers then spending time like going to the park, or the mall. For my second opinion that people should not get off of computers because it they ever leave somewhere far they are not to be able to contact you. If you on the computer you could get a computer that say's a free labtop then you could take it far like: On a airplane to north carolina, or virginia, or wasington @ORGANIZATION1, or a party, or a road trip, or on a ferry boat to the long island sound. For my third opinion that I agree people should not be off of computer because they might plan a trip to a far away place or a new house, or planing a anerveriry, or a new spot for a hunny moon a gorgest place like ona peek hill or at a hotel with a bed shape like a heart. For my fourth paragraph that I agree that people should not be off of computers that the count a location than person house or a location where they might be for that particular spot where that person is. For the fifth paragraph that I agree that people should not be able to get off of computers. I tell you why planning a birthday party for there child, or going to someone house for a visit like to tennessee. Or going to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to see a basketball team and @CAPS1.S a another team and they are call @CAPS2 @CAPS3 lakers us caverlars. My conclusion is that people should not to be able to get off of computer."	3	4		7																					
1577	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 people haved used a computer to learn new things such as cultures. Computers effect people in so @CAPS3 positive ways. They changed the way people think and how they look at the world. Experts even say how computers change the way they act at home and in the public. @CAPS6 also helps speical learn how to read and spell. A lot of people have used computers to learn different cultures. Which has helped are society in @CAPS3 ways. By edcuting youth so they don't make mistakes such as racial ways. Computers helped people learn things besides racial ways in the past but also about there own culture. Which has been proven by @ORGANIZATION1 news. People state that computers have made citizens lose there daily exercis. But people don't only use the computer to study they also use @CAPS6 to find different @CAPS4 different diets and ways to strech there body so they won't hurt themselfs, less than @PERCENT1 studied that the computer diets and different if themselfs to in The @CAPS5 times has said, ""The computer not only help our fitness, but also help stay in know our @CAPS6 keeps our world by one little click.

1580	1	"Dear @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1, I am a @ORGANIZATION2 student and I hear that some people think it is good to use computers and others think that its a waist of time. Well I have @NUM1 good reasons as to why computers are good technology. One reason is you can book places that you want to go or the sights you want to see. This is a good way to use the computer because you can track your route you can even print a map and go hiking. (hows that for excersing). Another reason why computers are good to use is because of online chats. Let's say that you have a family member that lives all the way out in @LOCATION1 and they have a computer and you want to talk to them but it costs you to talk, you can e-mail. This is a good way to use the computer because you can stay updated on what is going on with your family members. Another reason is learning. You can learn about many different cultures. You can learn about different people and how they live their life and ther cultures. My last reason is the @CAPS1. This is a great way to use the computer because you can keep updated on the lafest things like the earthquake in hati; or a hurricane or a @CAPS1 breaking story. Or if their is a storm headey your way. In conclusion, using the computer has great ways to be used and sure people, put some bad sights out their but if you use it the right way it is a good source of technology!"	4	4		8																					
1590	1	"Dear Local @CAPS1: I'm sitting at the couch thinking about what I should do for vacation. I know I definitely want to take a trip somewhere to do same creative writing, but my notebooks are all scattered, I don't know how to quickly contact someone who could help and I have no idea about the country that I plan to visit. I take a last look at my notebooks strewn about the closet looking very much like a tornado swept through and I find solution on the highest shelf my laptop. First, I highly agree with the people who think computers are useful. Three effects they have on people who use them usely are fantastic. Compare a person with a laptop to one without. The person with a laptop @MONTH1 be a busy business person and have to converse with many people from long distances a part, so they use e'mail and @ORGANIZATION1. They travel places with people at their fingertips. However a person without a laptop could be busy moving from place to place just to meet these people. Their schedule could be chaotic. Conversations over a chat system are fast and effective. Take my story for example. My mom hates wasting, so instead of me driving to a friend we @CAPS2. Saves money and time! In addition, I happen to be a writer who write often everyday in many notebooks. I've written so much over the years that my notebooks are piling all over my room. What organizational tool could help me in this situation? Why a laptop of course! One laptop or computer store a bunch of and editing a breeze. Anyone who with data and writing would be crazy not to have a computer! What you a room notebooks that you buy of, or a single, computer with tons of space and back up? You tell me. Computers encourage users to be more organized! Respectively, computers are resource for a millions of pages information. They're similar to libraries. But think about a library and then imagine a computer. One you have to walk around to seek your information and with the other, knowledge is merely a click away. Some @MONTH1 argue that computer websites are not entirely reliable I beg to differ. There are specific websites on computers with suffixes like '.org' and'.gov' and even'.edu'. These websites contain proven factual information and more great resources for research. By using computers I have acquired greater knowledge and have found computers beneficial. They have effectively made me more intellgent as a person. In conclusion, it's my strong opinion that those who use computers gain nothing but the positive effects, and these include money/gas-saving conversations through @CAPS2 and email organization and increased intelligence from reading. I've decide to take my creative writing on my laptop and in doing so learned the storm."	6	5		11																					
1595	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people is they help make every day life easyier. First off, you can chat with people from long distances. Also, it makes home work, and finding information a lot easyier as well. Last but not least when you have nothing else to do, you can play games, and watch videos from online. One of the best things about computers is going online and chatting with @CAPS1 friends. Even if the are across the country, you can still chat with them, for free! Also, if you can't get in touch with them, you can send them a @CAPS2-mail, and as soon as they log on, they will get your message. Best of all, when you forget to write your home work down, you can go online, and ask one of your friend what it was. Besides talking to people, you can do your homework on a computer as well. All you have to do is make a word document, and type with the keys. Let me just say this is a lot better than having to write with a pencil. Not to mention, typing a paper is a lot neater. Also, if you are doing a report on something, all you have to do is look it up on the internet, and you'll get endless information about it, all on your computer! Last but not least, you can play games on your computer. Whenever someone is bored doing nothing they can just turn on a computer, and play their favorite game. Not only is it fun, but it teaches hand-eye coordination as well. Some people say they don't have the money for games, but little do they know, there are millions of free online games, that any age can play. This is great on a boring day when you have nothing else to do. In summary, the effects computers have on people is they help make everyday life easyier. You can chat with people from long distances, and it even makes home work much easyier to complete. Not to mention it has fun games for people to play when there bored, or have nothing to do. I strongly belive that computers have a positive effect on people, because of all the things they offer, and help us on. Thank you."	4	4		8																					
1597	1	"North @CAPS1 courier, I would like to give you my opinion on the usage of computers. I am a person who supports the advances in technology and believe computers have a positive effect on people, @CAPS2 ran benefit people in many ways. The three most important ways to me is that @CAPS2 helps with hand-eye coordination, gives people another source to retain knowledge from, and lastly @CAPS2 realise to another way for people communicate. Hand-eye coordination is an awesome skill to have in our society. In a country, being the @LOCATION2, that revolves around sports, hand-eye coordination really helps out. Using the computers really helps harness and train your hand-eye for sports such as baseball, basketball and many more. Using the computers for hand-eye coordination will really help the @LOCATION2 to develop some world class athletes. We also live in a country where their are so many drivers and cars on the road. We have a problem with bad drivers here in the @LOCATION2 so if they improve their coordination maybe the numbers of car accidents and fatalities involving automobile will decreas. Well how in computers help with with hand-eye coordination yoe ask? I'll tell you how, by people using fun gaming sites, like luniosity.com, which is a website with games for brain training. @CAPS2 helps with hand-eye coordination, concentration, memorization, and problem solving. They help your brain in all of these categories just by having cute and fun little game. As you can see in the @LOCATION2 we need improved hand-eye coordination and @CAPS2 could do many positive things for the country. We cam improve @CAPS2 just by computer. To retain knowledge about other cultures, places, people and miscellaneous things makes to amazing thanks to the computer we have for this information besides books. have the internet and computers you can know about what you want when you type in the subject into a search engine like google or yahoo. People can learn all of this wonderful and interesting information about things they of never known before. @CAPS2 also helps kids like to find information for reports and. There are truly you can learn on the internet. You can learn about or. Maybe the difference between an element and a compound, or even just the definition of the word sucess than is a to @LOCATION1. You can get so much knowledge from the computers/internet. Communication is another huge part of our daily lives. Most people have home phones or call phones, but for the ones who dont they need as meen of communication. On the computer you can use instant @CAPS3 or email; @CAPS4 twitter, or myspace as well. The computer gives people who don't have phones another way to communicate with others. Even if you do have a phone and someone you known is overseas. Instead of wasting money on a long distances just use one of the systems y've mentioned. The same thing goes for our military, they don't have phones to call home so they communicate via the computer. Communicating via computer is just another reason why the computer is so important. So as I conclude my letter to you, the north @CAPS1 courier, I shall restate that I do support technology because they do have positive effects on people. The positive effects that are the most major are @CAPS2 teaches hand-eye coordinating helps people with another source to gain knowledge, and lastly @CAPS2 allows another way to communicate with people. I will tell you once again computers benefits society and do have positive effects."	6	5		11																					
1601	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 reading your paper weekly and @CAPS2 up with local events, I was able to retrieve the information of a contreversy dealing with the effects of computers. I for one think that the computer was come to be one of the greatest inventions ever created. It was @CAPS3 changed our Society, and if you ask me, in a very posotive way. My first reason has to do with the knowledge that the computer possesses. You can practically discover anything in the blink of an eye, as opossed to a book or going to the library; which is very time consuming Not only does a computer take for less time to get information, it also holds a much large amount of information than a library can store. Computers hold knowledge on almost everything imaginable, but best of all, its right your fingertips. Another great characteristic of the computer, is it's ability to let people @NUM1 miles apart converse freely. This might just be the greatest thing about the computer. Chatting online completeley erases the hassel of @CAPS4 phone bills and carrying around cell phones, You can speak with friends half way around the world with no cost to you, amazing!!! The one thing that is faulty about the computer is it's overusage by children although this is a significant problem, it is not the computer's fault. Kids should no the limit. There should be @ORGANIZATION1 for both being on the computer and for excersise and fun with friends this problem has most likely influenced many to com to dislike the computer, but you must understand that the time children spend on the computer is entirely up to him/her or the parents. In @CAPS5 I hope I have persuaded you enough to agree with my thoughts and to give the computer a chance, im sure you'll be satisfied."	4	4		8																					
1603	1	"To the local Newspaper, I think using computers does not have a negative effect on people. I believe it's an advantage to use it. You are given technology, advantage so why not use it? They give people chance to chat with people allow them to make friends. These days people even watch to shows on the computer-websites such as: @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1 allows them to search anything and watch it on @CAPS1. People make emails, download music and several other things. Children at the age of @NUM1, @NUM2 even @NUM3 move use computers-play games on them. i have a cousin who is @NUM3 and he plays games on it all the time he even knows how to search something on the computer. Some people @MONTH1 think it gives you a negative effect, but really it doesn't. Those people think that should comee to the reality. We have to step up as the life goes. Let's say a girl doesn't have a computer, her parents think that computers spoil children, their technology spoil children. The girl goes to school, her friends asks her to give them her e-mail. Every time her friends asks her about email she makes up some excuse and tries to avoid the subject. this time she made an excuse, but how many times is she going to make up an excuse. Then suppose one day her friends finds out she doesn't have a computer and embarasses her in front of everyone. So, what I'm trying to say is that you have to see around you and go on with it computer also saves your time. You can just type instead of writing whole out. You can make your writing cursive or any other that you would like. After reeding my letter, I hope you understand my point. Next time you see a person who thinks computers give negative effects to people, tell the advantages of the computers and how it benefits society around you."	4	4		8																					
1607	1	"Dear who ever this @MONTH1 concern, I think that people spend way too much time on computers. They do not exercise as much. People sit inside all day instead of going outside to enjoy nature. Family's and @CAPS1's are spending less time together because they have computers to talk to each other. Computer's have become a negative influence on people today. People need exercise to live. It keeps us healthy. With all the fast food places pople need exercise more now than ever. People do not want to exercise if they have a computer to go on. A staticstic is @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS2's @CAPS3 each have their own computer in the house. They said ""I would much rather be on the computer than outside"" (@PERSON2 @NUM3 grader at @ORGANIZATION1). Even students do not want to exercise when they could be spending time on the computer. Human only have so long to live. There is beautiful nature outside. We do not enjoy our surrounding because we would rather be on th computer. For example @PERSON1 would rather spend her day on the computer than enjoying the amazing nature we have around us. @NUM4 out of @NUM2 students enjoy nature every week. A young girl about @NUM6 never apperciated nature until her parents made her stay in a month. She now loves nature. because it got boaring day after day on the computer. Family and friends are huge parts of our life. We want them to be apart of our big events. Because of the computer we can talk to them whenever or email a video of our big event. But would it not be much better for them to be there, @CAPS4 you on when it is hapenning. When I was around @NUM1 @CAPS5 grandparents used to come to @CAPS5 soccer games, but now they dornot because @CAPS5 mom just records it for them to watch. I liked it so much better when they were at the soccer games, @CAPS4 me on. ""@CAPS5 family and @CAPS1 are the ones I want at @CAPS5 events, not to just show them after the event happend. A @CAPS6 is that everyone wants to share their event with the family. Computers aren't that great. They make it so family and friends do not come to see you. Computers take you away from the beautiful nature that surronds us. It limmits you on exercise and makes you gain weight, which is unhealthy. I urge you to use your computer less and exercise, see family, and enjoy nature."	5	4		9																					
1610	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I remember when I was younger my parents got two laptops for themselves. Internet use was always available, interaction of online chat. It was extremly exciting for them. On the other hand, I got to sit home and watch them have fun. I couldn't go outside, or hang out with friends just because I was stranded insided as they enjoyed the computer. I strongly feel as if computers do not benefit society. People spend too much time using the internet than exercising, nobody gets to enjoy the beauty of nature, and there is less interaction with family and friends. There are many holes being dog while computers one still being used and bought. Our society is just going downhill from here. People don't need to be sitting at home inside breathing reused air while using the computer. Proffessor @PERSON3, a health generalist, stated on @ORGANIZATION2 news that @PERCENT1 of all people around @LOCATION1 would rather be on the computer at home doing nothing than going outside and/or getting some kind of exercise. Could you imagine all of those unhealthy people not worriying about anything except their computer? the only thing computers do for us these days is abandon our free time. @CAPS2 waist @PERCENT2 of there spare time on their computer. If technology decreases there new games people play, and sites people use, it is likey for people to get out of the house and do something healthy for themselves. @PERSON1, owner of @ORGANIZATION1, said ""I have never seen in my entire life, so many people using there computers and internet. Its been quite sometimes when over one billion @CAPS2 are online on a typical weekend. "" @PERSON1 later mentions "" it's kind of depressing of how much time they spend on computers, than outside and enjoying nature."" Not only is excersicing time headed down the drain, but our used to be "" beautiful"" nature is as well. Many young kids these days are watching @CAPS3, they see computer game commercials there parents buy them the game, and all of a sudden they are on it @NUM1. Since adults aren't doing there part by idolizing these kids to persuade them to run around outside and do something healthy. The kids need to step up for a change! Did you know global warming is caused by the minimum density in the air? If we have almost to no children or adults running around outside, our world is not flowing too well. Hence our budget is low, and pollution is extremly off the wall; our nature is going from beatifu to less and lesser. @PERSON2, a government official has survey @NUM2 people from each state asking about how much time they spend weekly of just enjoying nature and roleizing the beaty of it. The survey reads one in every @NUM3 people thoughly breathe in the beauty for at least @NUM4 minuests, a week. I mean come on; that's pathetic. Maybe if we surely excluded computers and technology for a while, global warming won't be nessicary. I remember when I was about @NUM4 years old an I never once got to meet my other family besides my siblings. It was pretty sad because I'm always told I have a huge family that is very known to our town but I have no clue who they are ! this is all because technology was invented. Never once have I ever been outside and relaxed besides when I got on and off the bus for school. My parents stand me in my house as they use the computer. The other day I just found out what ""show"" is because my moms computer brake and now I am get introduced to my other family along with the freedom of going outside. Ever since my mom's computer brake she has lots of free time to spend with me. Technology ruined my childhood as a kid and without it you get to open up the real importance of life. Would you want to become obese, like through global warming, and/or to not interact with family or outside nature? Its sadi how @PERCENT3 of these reasonings are caused by the excessvive use of technology and computers. Let's just get rid of it all! Thank you for your time @CAPS1!"	5	6		11

1617	1	"Dear local newspaper, I feel that the people using computers benefits our society. I feel this way because computers give people the ability to learn about far away places: and people have educational websites, and even allow people to talk online with other people. First of all computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. When I was in sixth grade I had to do a project on @ORGANIZATION1 didn't know anything about him. But, luckily we have computers so I was able to @ORGANIZATION2 on a computer and found a wodd or information on him and got an a plus on the project. Also, when I was in fourth grade I had to do a project on @LOCATION1. I went on a computer went on @CAPS1.com a get lots of imformation and got on a plus. The second reason computers are benefitial to the society is because computers have educational websites. Computer technologist @PERSON1 saids, ""@CAPS2 percent of the computers websites are educational. I also remember when i was in seventh grade the whole class went on @CAPS3. com and were able to learn math and have fun at the same time. Last but not the least, computers allow people to talk with other people from around the world. Theres a website calle myspace.com and it allows me and other people to talk online around the world. I asked my class and ninety percent of them go on myspace.com. On the other hand the computer does have cons. Some kids go on unprohibited websites that are not for minors. Theres a website called @NUM1.com and it has shooting and killing games that are not for kids. Also, some people are computer addicts who stay on computers almost twenty four seven. Now, you know my reasons, why computers are good to the society, they give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, have educational websites, and even allow people to tlak to other people online. What is your choice in these actions. "	4	4		8																					
1620	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, The question everyone is asking if computers benfit society? I believe that computers don’t because you can’t get exercise if youre always on the computers and @CAPS2's really hard to enjoy nature too. Another reason comuters don't benefit society is that you aren't interacting with friends and family. hopfully I have encouraged you to not use computers as much and go have fun with your family. If you are always on the computer how are you going to get exercise? @CAPS2's proven that more than half of united states of @CAPS1 is over weight. Exercising is more important than using the computer and knowing that you could be doing something use that you know is better wouldn't you do @CAPS2? Interacting with poeple is important to do because you can meet new people and if you don;t then you might learn to be shy and not make as much friends as you like @CAPS2's true taht oyu can make new friends over the computer but @CAPS2's not the some meeting them in person. Also if you do make a ""friends"" over the internet, you don't know if they are a stalker or a murderer. I urge you to go out and meet new people and not on the internet. knowing that you are better off not using the computer and being with the poeple you like, wouldn't you do @CAPS2? Yes you can play games on the computer but @CAPS2 would be ebtter if you play @CAPS2 with your fmaily.

When his sister showed him @CAPS3, @CAPS4, myspace, @CAPS5, etc. He would stay on for hours and after a month, it didn't get better, day after day he began to come outside less and less, and I began to hate him fo that. Statistics show that people who are using computers excessively tend to have drop in their grades. People are mixed in to these machines they become anti-social, don't do homework, potentially fail the unit and reappeat the grade. Computers are the same as watching tv, sure! they teach hand to eye coordination but at the same time their brains are being turned into swiss cheese. I believe computers are the best idea, since pouring gasoline on pancakes. "	4	4		8																					
1632	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I do believe that computers can be positive. If you think about it, they can actually help you learn with all those different programs they have. Say you need tutoring or advice, you can basically find all that on a computer even if you have a little kid with, I'm absolutly sure that they have websites and programs for them, and trust me they're fun and educational! You know how people are complaining that computers are taking away time from exercising, and inteacting with family and friends? Well, what if you have family living somewheres else. You can chat with them! And also do execise while on the computer. I'm sure if you keep reading you'll know why I think they're positive. Having trouble in school? Are they blaming it on computers? Well we can change that! If we're able to prove to people that computers can help us learn and are educationaly then people might actually think that computers aren't bad with all of this technology that were coming up with these days arent that bad. I'm pretty sure that they have some sort of tutoring program, they even have college online! Now theres something to look into. Do you have a kid, a younger friend, or even a younger brother and sister? Are they always looking for games to play? Well I'm @PERCENT1 sure that they have fun learning games and websites on a computer! So, while the're having fun, you can just think of how much they're learning now! It's a real fun way of learning! You can just imagine on what they're learning and how well they're doing on school. Do you have family who live far away that you don't see much? Well if you all have a computer than you can posibily stay in touch! You guys can chat each other, check up on each other, and see how everyone is doing. It's a perfect way to stay in touch. Want to know what would also be a good way to connect, a webcam! You don't have to have one, it's just a suggestion. So that way not only do you get to talk to them, but you can see them too. Isn't that cool? I don't know about you but I think so. Well now that you've heart what I've had to say about how I think computers are positive. I hope you think the same too. If you really think about it, they aren't bad at all. They're actually very helpful. Thank you,"	4	4		8																					
1644	1	"Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe computers can be bad for society. My reasons being people are spending to much time on their computers, less time exercising, and lose interacting with family and friends. My first reason why i think computers are bad for our society is people are spending to much time on them. I know when i get home from school the computer is all i can think about until i go on. It's like an addiction. People spend all their time on a social net work other then going out and meeting new people. My second reason is people spend less time exercising. Ive been over a friends house before, and all we did was play computer games instead of enjoying nature outside. Alot of @CAPS1 don't make healthy food choices, so why not go out and exercise? It's because of the computer. Ive seen my little brother spend his whole saterday eating in front of the computer and playing games. It's just unhealthy. My last and final reason is it takes time away from family and friends ive spent my whole day after school in my room on the computer. It's like when your on the computer nothing else matters because you think ""hey why not just talk to my friends over @CAPS2, or myspce, or facebook! you lose a lot of friendships like this. Also you lose friendship with you family because you badly talk to them while your on the computer. Half the time im to busy talking to someone i don't know then helping my little brother with home work, or helping my mom clean the house. In conclusion these are my three reasons why i think the computer is bad for sivilization. I really hope you take all this into consideration and really think what the computer can do to @CAPS1 I people once again those three resons are one, people are spending to much time on their computer. Two, spend less time exercising. Three, lose interactions with family and friends."	4	4		8																					
1645	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @DATE1, computers are a big part of our society. They are an advance in technology, and they have some positive effects. However, computers have more negative effects on people. They take away and diminish @CAPS3 time, interacting with family, and seeing the world. First, computers have a negative effect on people because they diminish @CAPS3 time. People are so caught up with computers, their desire for @CAPS3 starts to fall. According to a @ORGANIZATION3 survey in @DATE2, for @CAPS1 person spending @NUM1 hours on the computer a week (roughly @NUM2 hours each day) had an increase in cholesterol and slowly deterioating muscles. ""Computers distract people from their needs"" says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS1 person needs about one to two hours of physical activity each day, and only @NUM2 out of @NUM4 people get this amount."" The leading cause for this low number? ""technology,"" she says, ""@CAPS2 computers, which take away all of the motivation and time people need to @CAPS3."" @CAPS3 is vital, and computers are taking this away from society. People shouldn't have bad @ORGANIZATION1 because of this negative effect: computers. Second, computers have a negative effect on people because they deteriorate interaction with family. @NUM5 out of @NUM4 people say that computers take away from their family time, reports Family @CAPS4 @ORGANIZATION3. This is not of all good, especially since @CAPS1 person needs at least @NUM7 hours of interacting with family for an assured healthy mental state and being. Children are directly affected by computer use in family settings. When computer time starts to eat up time, it also cuts of communication, something extremeley important in graving children. with this, family bonds and relationship are ruined as wal. It affects interacting with family, and puts hates in family bonds: computers haved negative effect on people. Lastly, computers have a negative effect on people because it takes away from people using their world. When you're on the computer, it seems like the entire world is in your computer screen. But its not. This is effecting people negatively. @PERCENT1 of people who use computers on the stocking average of about @NUM2 hours a day have notedly become withdrawn and unaware of their world says my physcology.net. The cure? Traveling, or even talking walks to enjoy nature can help. People should be aware of their world in which they live. They have to make important descions for themselves, their children, even their country, and staring at a computer screen wont help at all. It especially will effect children, the next generation, who will have no knowledge or a clear view on the world if people keep up their negative habits: computer usage. In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people. They diminish @CAPS3, so bad @ORGANIZATION1 increases and the need for @CAPS3 increases. It cuts family interaction by destroying family relationships and bonds, not to mention communication. Finally, it takes away from people seeing the world, something actually very important because it affects people's desicion making as well as future generations. People need to realize these bad effects, and majorly decrease their computer usage."	6	5		11																					
1646	1	"Computers have alot of impact on peoples life! Computers can be helpful and distracting at the same time. I have a computer, but I can only go on if after I finish my homework. I do alot of things on my computer mostly games and social websites like myspce. Computers can be helpful by helping you with homework or find information. I use my computer for homework alot like for project or if i dont know what the subject is about. I also think the computers are helpful by talking to friends or family. I talk to my family alot and they live all the way in @LOCATION1. I go on myspace like five times a week. Computers can also be a distration by making people lazy and have bad websites. Like myspace can be dangerous. If you tell someone all your important information and you don't know them. That can turn out very bad. Alot of people dont even get off the computer. I have alot of family members that only get up to go on the computer or play video games. They don't get off too. There on like for eight hours. My mom also uses the computer to go on @CAPS1. She talks to alot of her friends that she left in @LOCATION1. She still talks to the people in high school, but she mostly talks to her older sister. She's not on the computer for @NUM1. She's on like for @NUM2 minutes to an hour. I think computers can help in life, but not to be on for like eight hours. You'll see what you will turn if you do that every. My cousins are getting bigger and bigger. I don't mean height. So if you do go on the computer not for almost half the day! "	4	4		8																					
1649	1	"Dear @CAPS1, Computers tend to have more negative effects on people, rather than positive. This is true because people @MONTH1 not be getting enough exercise, people @MONTH1 not be enjoying nature to the forest, and lastly, because in this world, people do not spend enough time with family and friends. Computer are good to have around the house, but. To begin, people are spending too much time on computers. They are having more of a negative effect because while on the computer, you are not getting excercise. Think about the a day doing fat because of all the fast food on the computer while eating it. Obeseity now a days is a big concern with the @ORGANIZATION1. Staying on the computer does not help the situation. Any concerned person, technologically challenged would agree the countless ones on the computer are no good for the health of our country. Further more, people are spending too much time on computers and not enough beauty of nature. Many people, adults and have @DATE1 because they are world but there that should be explored and people should be thankful for beautiful that we have still @DATE1. They should be things wait to see it. Although communication is important for everyone, instead of talking on the computer, people should make plans with their family and friends. This idea also relates back to the lack of exercise and naivety of people. If people were to go out and enjoy life to the forest with their friends and family, there wouldn't be numerous hours a day wasted on a computer. People should get off their butts and go. Life is too short to sit around all day. Any intelligent person would realize that computer time isn't as fun as family and friend time. To conclude, computers are and have been very over-used recently. Instead of having problems, lack of sun, and just boring computer talk, people should got up and go. We only live once, and that once should be lived to the fulest!"	4	5		9																					
1651	1	"Dear, @ORGANIZATION2. A computer is a very helpful resource. It helps people navagate through life, they can find jobs, do research for school. This world wold be nothing without computers. But on the other hand some people do spend to much time on the computer. But surfing the web for countless hours is their choice. Computers can help students do research from the comfort of their own home. Instead of going to the local library and looking and looking for books, all they have to do is type in thier research topic and wallah tons of different websites are right under their noses. A computer is the world at your finger tips. Also a computer can help unemployed people find a job. Its easy, type in what city you want to work in, and there you go. You can even fill out a job application right then and there. Hey, some people even work from home. Stay at home moms can easily make money while doing daily chores like washing dishes. Also working from home can a lot less tessful. It's less stressful because you dont have to deal with annoying and impatiant co. workers. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of employment is from the workers home, @CAPS1 now you know. Working from home makes another day at the office, another day at home. Computers have helped us come along way since caveman times. Without computers this would will be nothing. We woulde have so many basic things like stoplights, elevators, and even bleders. We also wouldn't have the more sifisticated things like fockets. and cars and planes. Imagine an airport without computers, where would they store all of their information? On paper? Where would a school store all their grades and tardys? On paper? Where would the goverment store their information? On paper? With those three palces we already cut down half of the @ORGANIZATION1. Computer help the environment too. They will also help us to invent more technology so that one day we can live on @CAPS2 or something. I hope this essay changed your mind about computers. Lets recap they help students reasearch, help people find jobs, you can work from home. Helps the environment. Without computers we would live in caves and walk around with leaves for underwear like caveman. The @CAPS3 line is that computers are very helpful."	5	4		9																					
1655	1	"Dear local newspaper, I think computers have a positive effect on people. Some adults and mostly kids are not getting enough exercise, or even spending time with family. Some parents are less active with their kids. Kids are failing to do their homework because they are always on the computer when they get home. Adults and kids are getting less excersize. Sitting down reading or what ever they do on the computer is not excersizeing. They are going to get fat because they eat and sit down and than they get hungery again than eat and sit down. Some people say that your getting finger and arm exsersize by and moveing the mouse, thats not really true. Looking at the computer screen all day can cause masive hand People are also not spending time with family. They are sitting infront or a computer and ignoring everyone and everything around them. Kids could be enjoying other things besides computers. Parents could be outside. Playing catch with their kids or even playing a board game with them. People are not less active. They are not going out and haveing fun jumping around with their friends. Instead they aim them on computers or message them on facebook or even myspace. Kids are failing in school because they fail to do their home work after school. They would rather go on the computer. This is why i think computers have an positive effect on kids and adults."	4	4		8																					
1666	1	"Dear @LOCATION1 press, I have recently heard about many arguments based on computers ruining society. I strongly disagree with this. I think the computer is a great way to hook up with old friends. The internet is also faster for research than looking in a book and there are many games on the internet. I believe that the internet is a great way to hook up with old friends. Some people have moved away and I haven't been able to talk to then. Now, with the internet I can able to talk again. The same case with my mom. She had friends from high school and college who she ever talked to. Now, with facebook she has re united with them. This also helps because you can email someone interested of sending a letter in the mail, which costs money, unlike email. So the internet can also be a way of saving money. It is also much faster to send someone an email than a letter. The internet is a great way to keep intouch with friends and relatives. I also believe that the use of computer is more efficient than doing to a library and researching a book. If you don't have enough time to go the to a library, you can do some research at your house. What if the library is closed if you do go, then you wasted some time. The internet never closes, it is open @NUM1. What if you go to the library and they are open, but do hot have a book on your subject? This can also be done on the internet because there is any thing you could ever ask for on the internet. If you have an over due library book you can renew the book on the internet. The internet is a great place research on any topic you have or doing what ever you want. Finally, the computer is great for playing about every game, there is that you would feel like playing. Also @CAPS1 of spending about @MONEY1 on an x-box and a game, you @MONTH1 only have to spend about @MONEY2 on a game that goes into your computer. There are also many websites that have games on them. Some websites are for specific games, and same have many games on them. Only a few of the games are interactive with other players and you can talk and make new friends. On the other hand, many games are only for one player. As a result, a computer is a great use to play games. In conclusion, I believe the computer is great need for our society. In the long run it will pay off, especially with the economics problems our country is having now, by helping us save money,. It will also allow connection with old friends, save time, and provide entertainment to all who would like."	5	4		9																					
1667	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Which article title more interesting, ""Local @CAPS1 wins three mile race"" or ""Local @CAPS1 wins three mile race on computer game."" @CAPS3, the less interesting title is what your news will change to if people keep using computers. Some effects computers have on people use cheating an less time with family and friends and lastly, most people aren't learning anything while on the computer, they're just plaing games. As you can see, I agree that computers are a bad idea. I bet some people have never thought of this but computers can lead kids, and maybe even adults, to cheating. There are websites on the internet where the user just types the question in, and they get an answer. There is @CAPS4 another way of cheating, copying others work, essays or articles form a website. Some students could be told to write a biography on a person, and they could just copy an article, switch some words around to make a sound like their own paper, and with no guilt. Another can people computer spend less time with family and friends I was watching television and playing on the computer. The wife was very close to because spent the computer helping @CAPS4, there can was always in the on the computers. Because this show I realized that computers kinds anti-social divorce between parents go up. Do you see all people computers looking up facts about things as going on the computers learning. I know that when I have time to go on the computer, I am not looking up things to learn. Most people these days dont care too much about learning about countries, other than their own, or people, other than people they know. I think it's pretty obvious that noone is going on computers to learn, otherwise they wouldn't have so many users on game websites. In conclusion, computers have negative effects that get to all people. So, @ORGANIZATION1 you want to have your news be the latest divorces and computer game high scores? Or do you want interesting news that will keep you newspaper going. Thanks for taking the time to read this."	5	5		10																					
1670	1	"Do you like learning about faraway exotic land and animals? Are you good at sports but would like to be even better? Do you ever miss your family that lives in other states? The computer can help you with all of this but is @CAPS1 bad for you too? In my opion kids and adults should use the computer. When people are on the computer they can learn about interesting far away lands. When your on the computer you can look up some of the natural disasters. For example people could google each quakes and learn all about the people that has lost their life's. The people that they will donate some money to the poor. Children living on their own. They can also learn about all the wonderful beautiful lands that are out their waiting to be explored. Everyone I know likes to the beutiful birds and animal. In their the world, They will be able to do this on computer. The might be so more this lands. Having a computer will also let you talk to people that are not easy to get. With having a computer people will be able to talk to their family that live in other states then them. I have a uncle that lives in @LOCATION1. I only get to see him because a lot of money to come. Somewhere on the computer, @CAPS1 is easy to just send him a message that say how I'm doing. With computer you will be able to talk to your friends cant talk on the phone. For example, what if your friend and did not. She can not talk phone because so what do you do you. This help you her. The last reason why we should have computer. If you let @MONTH1 periods of time then @CAPS1 will help you with hand eye coordination. This will help the kids that play baseball. They will know where the ball is at all times is they will most likely cauch the ball more often so playing a a little bit of video games is not bad for unless one. Using the computer is @CAPS1 good to do or not using the computer helps people be able to interact wild people that so easy to talk to.

1674	1	"Dear @CAPS1's at the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 to @PERSON2, ""Computers have helped me further @CAPS6 research. I can search up so many things to help a patient and keep all @CAPS6 important information organized."" @CAPS3 you question a leading doctor? I agree with @PERSON3 and say that computers are good use in society today. People were already becoming lazy because of television. You can't balme it on computers. With websites such as @CAPS4 and @CAPS5, people can keep in touch. They can make plans with one another to go for a walk in the park or dancing. These things can keep people healthy, active and in tiptop shape. Computers help people keep in contact with others. ""@CAPS6 patients can email me to schedule an appointment and let me now if they think something's very wrong with them."" say's @PERSON1. With computers, you can email distant family and friends to learn if there are problems quicker. Most people tend not to pick up the phone if someone calls during a crisis. You also don't have to worry about running up your phone bill. you can just @CAPS4 chat with a bud instead of using up an hours worth of minutes. You can learn so much more information faster. How @CAPS3 feel if no one called and told you your bestfriend died or your mom, and you had to find out by reading the newspaper? You'd be extremely upset. I know I @CAPS3 be with email, you and your family can stay in touch with old, new, and now friends. So if anything bad happens and a person didn't know hoe to tell you, they could email you. It's so much easier than telling a person that their.mom died by email them by phone. To hear pain in a person's voice will make you want to cry. You feel their pain. So, now do you understand that computers are a great benefit to today's society? You can't blame computer's for people becoming lazy, since television was already doing that. If a person want's to be lazy, then that's their decision. you shouln't go around blaming pothers and things when its no one else's fault but that persons. This is a great way to keep in contact with other's. Plus, think of all the information you can learn. Not just about family and friends, but the world too. Thank you for taking the time to read @CAPS6 essay and I hope you can see things @CAPS6 way."	4	4		8

1682	1	"Many people think computers are bad or that we spend less time outside because of them. But are they are bad for individuals to use as people say they are. In this instance, a moderation would be helpful. When you think of computers, what comes to mind. Games? Social @CAPS1? What if computers are doing more than that? Last year, a computer helped diagnose a concussion of mine and helped figure out I've had @NUM1 others. Not to mention the computer did quicker and more efficient than a regular human. An expert says ""Computers diagnose anything, not just concussions, @PERCENT1 better than doctors."" @CAPS2 the social netwowrking has a positive aspect. This has let people, who haven't seen each other for a long time, reconnect and become good friends again. With the positive aspects there is always a negative. Computer have started to make kids obese. This is problem in the country because if we become lazy then we could ruin our country. In addition, if we become has reliant of computers @NUM2 diagnos, what happens when they get faulty? These are problems that are very real and aren't being with. If we cant deal with these problems first then computers will turn out to be a bad thing. Lastly, a moderation could be extremely helpful for us today. For example, instead of using social @CAPS1 for friends next door, go outside and play wiffle ball with them. Social @CAPS1 was made to reconnect with friends far away, not across the street. @CAPS2, instead of totally reling on computers to diagnose problems, have them and the doctor find out. Doing this will get great results and keep doctors prepared if computers, dont work. These are just a examples how moderation could be very helpful to everyone. In conclusion, having no computers wouldn't be a great idea because of how much they help society. Although, being totally dependent on them is a bad idea to because they don't have that much benefit to them."	4	4		8																					
1684	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 personal opinion on computer technology is that it is extreamly bad for you, and we need to take percaution, and worry about eye protection vertual harrasment, and that there are dangerouse people on the @CAPS2. Eye protection is important. Although computers are hurting them by, the screen being too bright and hurting your eyes. Also if you look for too long it could make them tierd. I can tell you from personal experence that glasses are un-cool and some people get picked on for it and that could happen if your eyes get hurt so you can see as well as you did befor. It's glasses or even going blind. Vertual harrasment is another thing to be aware of. Over the @CAPS2 you could be cyber bullyed by kids you @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not know. For example, one day you could be on @CAPS3 and be talking on a chat room and kids could make sexual, homophobic, or even just plain remakes. Witch brings me to the, sexual harrasment. Sexual harrasment if extreamly can make people feel usually bad selfs. Kids take pride in calling others bad names regarding there rase, there gender, or even the gender they like. So take extra percaution when seeing sexual harrasment. Sexual preditors are a parents biggest fear to kids. Sexual preditors are everyware, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS3, or even your neibors and wile kids are running around town looking and acting the way they do there extreamly un-safe. This is why you @CAPS7 put any personal information on the @CAPS2 not your adress, not your birthday, not your cell or house numbers, nothing not even your town. Also sometimes its a little dangerous to put your last name. So be very carful on the intrenet. When you see sexual harrasment, or someone being followed by a sexual preditor report them! and be safe."	4	4		8																					
1687	1	"Dear @CAPS1, Computers have really made an impact on society. Some people, think they have made a good impact while others think the opposite. I believe that they are a good thing in our lives and have made a drastic, but great impact. Some reasons that support my opinion are that computers are basically what helps us keep in touch with people, they make it very easy to find needed information and they make our school lives faster and much simpler. First of all, computers are pretty much how people keep in touch. There are many ways you can keep in touch over computers. Tere is video-chatting, e-mail and chat websites such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 etc. There are many people that really enjoy having the ability to keep in touch this way. It is a step up from talking on the phone. On the computer if you are web-chatting, you can not only talk to them, but you can see them! When it comes to chatting websites such as @CAPS2, there are millions of people who belong to this incredible website and love it. Kids and adults really enjoy having access to something like this. For me, since I moved to @STATE1 and had to leave all my friends behind, the computers has saved some of my relationships that I thought I would lose but didn't want to. I can e-mail my friends, and even see what they look like and how much they have changed on @CAPS2. Computers are a very helpful piece of technology that have helped me, and so many other people keep in touch. Another important reason computers are a wonderful technology item is because they make it so easy to find needed information. From what a word means, to the directions to get to @LOCATION1, the computer can help with all of this. I talked to my mom and she said. ""Computers just make @CAPS6 all of the information I need to knew about your brother's diabetes so easy."" @CAPS6 information in books can take so long. You have to go to the library or a bookstore, find the book you need with the correct information, and then you have to read through the whole book to find the information needed. On a computer, you can just google what you need to find, and read the article or map, etc. Computers have made @CAPS6 information a breeze and everyone loves how simple it is! The last reason that supports my opinion is that computers make our school lives faster and much simpler to deal with. In school, there are times when we need to write a very lengthy composition, and it will take forever to write. With a computer, typing up the composition would probably take around half the time of writing the composition. I took a survey of three kids that typed a composition and three kids that wrote it. I asked each of the kids how long it took them. The kids that wrote the paper said it took them around two hours. The kids that typed the composition said it took them around an hour. Also, when things are typed, they are usually easier to read which makes it easier for teachers to grade, and won't take as long. Computers make school easier for students and teachers. The opinion that computers are not a benefit to society just doesn't make sense. Yes, I know that there can be some disadvantages. But think of all the advantages compared to the disadvantages. There are a lot more good than bad things. Without computers, people would be incredibly stressed, and have a hard time making life easier. Computers are an amazing benefit to society. Everyone should agree with this because people stayin touch because of computers, computers make it very easy to find information that needed, and they make our school lives aint easier and faster for students and teachers. Computers have made an extremely large impact and changed our ways of life for the better!"	5	5		10

Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about other people and faraway places, also, you can use the internet to interact with friends and family. Computers can be very useful and efficient to anybody. Did you know that computers can teach hand-eye coordinaiton? Some computers have programs that teach you how to type. Without having to lock down at the keyboard. Even if people don't have the program they can learn how to type fact without having to look down. Many people that I know, have learned how to use the computer or type without anyone telling them hour to do so. Computers are very needed all around the world. Computers give people the ability to learn about other people and places. If you go on the internet you can go and searching person or place and the computer will find it for you. Children and adults need computers because if for example, a child get a project from schoool that need to be done about a famous person or smoking. she would most likely need to go to the internet . The game goes for adults that love jobs in offices, schools or anywhere else. Computers are essential to people all around the world. Computer can be used to comunicate with each other. People use computer to communicate with friends or family in far away places. They can communicate via e-mail, @CAPS2, video and maybe even in other web sites. Some web sites contain the ability to talk to each other through video or through messages, such as @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. People like using the computer because it is very useful when you need it most. If you ask anyone they will tell you that having a computer is very important and necessary. Why would people intend to take away something as important and useful as a computer? Computers can be used to learn hand-eye coordination, and help you move your fingers faster. They give poeple and places in the world. Finally, they can be used to communicate with one another through e-mail, message and many other ways. In my opinion, computers are one of the most important things to a person."	5	4		9																					
1694	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I think that people spend way too much time on the computer these days. They get less exercise. Don't get to enjoy the nature around them, and they don't get to interact with their family and friends! If people stop spending so much of their day on the computer, then they wouldn't be having too many issues. People need to spend less time on computers, and spending more time exercising! Computers all over the world do not involve much interaction with any part of your body other than your hands. You don't tend to want to get up or do anything else when you're on your computer, right? Well that needs to change. Often, peolple get cranky while they are using a computer or if they need to get off of one. Some people are so obsessed, they might even break down and have a fit! Nobody want's to see someone throw a fit because they have to get off the computer do they? If they don't get exercise anytime when you're not on a computer it can deffinately shows. Jimmy @CAPS2 syas, ""@CAPS3 @NUM1 kids are on their computers way to much! They never come out of their rooms, and if they ever do, then they are normally very cranky. They're getting fat! I can tell because all they eat is junk food. This needs to "" @CAPS4 can't even have a little of time with his children. They should go on a family trip and enjoy together! That brings us in next issue. We all need to enjoy nature more. Why would you spend your time on a computer looking of pictures of nature when you have it right there in your . It's because kids are too lazy to get off their lazy and go outisde. The best thing about nature is that if you are  about need to be alone or even just need to get , nature is always there for you anytime you need it. You can laways go otside with your friends and family too!. I'm sure that they would apreciate people getting off their computers to spend some quality time together. Yet again, our next and final issue. Computer obsessed teenagers and adults need to be with their family and friends. When talking to your friends why bother talking to them on the computer when you can just get together and go do something fun? ALso, when you spend time with your family, it brings them a lot closer toy ou. Nobody likes to not talk to the people you love and the people who reised you. When you're on a computer I just think of all the places you could , place you could be with. Nobody wants to be distant from their friends and family. Therefore, people should turn off their computers, go exercise, be around nature and have some quality time with their friends and family. Thank you"	5	5		10																					
1697	1	"Dear local newspaper editor, @CAPS1 you love haveing the enternet at your finger tips. Recently, it has been bought to my attention that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers. I firmly believe that this is correct. My three arguments are its not healthy, the friends you meet up there are siber friends and bad @CAPS5 @MONTH1 occur. First of all, being on the computer too much is not healthy. This reminds me of my friend named @CAPS2. @CAPS2 used to be humerous, outgoing and play alot of sports. One @CAPS3 day, her mother bought her a laptop. This laptop was blue and white-her two faverite colors. She was on it all day and all night. She took it with her everywhere she went. Well, it got to the point whare she stopped the sports, gained some weight and the sadness creptped upon her. She was in a depresion mode. She went to the doctors and they told her that she had to give up the computer and play with it for only two days a week for five hours only. She listened to the doctor and it took her about three months to get back to the fun @CAPS2 she used to be. Being on the computer too much can harm you and the people around you. Second of all, the friends you meet on the enternet are called cyber friends. You don't know who they realy are, where they realy live, or their real age. They can tell you any thing they want because they know that that's a little fantasy world. That is mently not healthy. It is very important for human beings to be socialy active. Being on the computer too much can harm your brain also. Third of all, @CAPS5 @MONTH1 pop up. If you are the type of person who is on the computer every chance you get like becky, it is not good for you or the device. Being on the computer can harm even the computer. Well, you've read my arguments and ideas. Please take them into consideration."	4	4		8																					
1706	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think computers have a good effect on people and not a bad effect. I think this for three reasons. My first reason is that they relieve stress. Without a computer in my opinion things would be a lot more stressful. With a computer you can easily look things up without wasting time or being stressed out by having to look for something. My second reason for thinking computers have a good effect on people is technology. Without technology things would be so much harder. Without computers it would be harder to neatly type assignments, print out pictures, and getting information. If we didn't have technology as in computers I think a lot or things would go wrong. My third reason for thinking computers have a good impact on people is that without them factories would crash. i say this because if you think about it could in a factory is ran by some type of computer. Without that computer telling the machines what to do everything practically wouldn't work! without the computer everything would become so time consuming that no one would want to get the work done. These are my three reasons why I think computers have a good effect on people."	3	3		6																					
1721	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are good far societey. One reason is kids cant write a @NUM1 page essay by hand the will use a computer because it is eascier. People use computers every day if it's not talking with friends playing games it peoples buenesness. I personally don't use a computer that often just to check my email and school work but that dosn't mean that people don't need them. People get excirsize even when they don't knew it like walking have so they are not of that. I personally believe that computers are not bad for but they can be helpful like a research projects like if you don't feel like looking book to find information you could go on a computer and look up somthig you could have the information at your finger tips. Why are peope so concerned about what we @CAPS4 with our. We excirsize nobody dosen't excersize we excersize at scheol when we walk home when we walk our dog take out the trash but thert might experience. Another great thing about computers is that you can video chat a live video chanel so that you can hear talk and see the person this is a great couse of if a paren is away on a burensness you can see them and talk to them I have used it to talk to friends as well. Coumpouters are also great thing becaus of the program that can with it the programs are word, excell, @CAPS2, @CAPS3 ex. They help you write essays, @CAPS4 grades, charts ex. Without coumpotors we would have to @CAPS4 it by hand wouldn't be neat it would be messy. Coumputer excersize your. The las reason why computers are so great the enternet because everthing is on the enternet like if you want to shop. Without the of your go fot it if you want to play games whatch videos you can chat with friends, post pictures, post videos I coiuld go on but I wont all I hope you the @CAPS1 got my point computors not bad for you an that's a fact kids love them and adults then so think I you took coumptor away from childre adults how would kids @CAPS4, how woud adulds fun busnesses think about what you would @CAPS4 to the world us theught computers. Hey coumptors how would you @CAPS4 your new paper. Think about its what kind of world it would be like like they ca'nt fun withouoght the coumputer inside them or the coumputr the grade for tests people don't realize that we need computers and they need us."	5	4		9																					
1725	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 a world where nobody has any hand-eye coordination @CAPS6 they try to cath a ball it slips away. There are no friendships or communication with other countries. Is this really what you want? Computers do have positive effects on people. For example, they help with hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Computers have a positive effect on people and the society. First, hand eye-coordination is not something that all people have. However, you can make it better by using computers and that is a fact. Computers @CAPS4 said that computer help @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 with their hand-eye coordination. For example, my mom used to have horrible hand-eye coordination but now that she uses a computer and it is much better. Oprah said, “ @CAPS6 I was young I couldn’t catch a ball but now that I’m older and using computers I’m the best.” @NUM1 out @NUM2 people agree that computer help hand-eye coordination. Next, computers help other people learn about faraway places. For example, if we didn’t have computers people wouldn’t travel to @LOCATION1. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 agree that they would never travel if it weren’t for computers it is a fact that people use the internet to learn about other countries for educational purposes. Www.exploretheworld.org wrote that @PERCENT2 of the people who use the website are students. Computers help other people learn about far away places. Finally, computers allow people to talk online. @PERCENT3 of people on facebook have at least one friend who live out of this country. It is a fact that countries are better allies @CAPS6 their people get along.Www.internationalfriendships.com wrote that they have over @NUM3 users who talk with people from other countries for example, my friend’s mother was born in @LOCATION2 and she talks online with many of her friends. Dr @PERSON1 said,”@CAPS8 friendships are the best kind because you learn about other cultures.” Computers are a wonderful way to talk to other people. Now @CAPS3 a world where every country got along because of online friendships. Where adults could play a game of baseball because they got their hand eye-coordination back. Where students could learn about distant places they didn’t know existed. Does't that sound great? Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places and allow people to talk online. So @CAPS1 @CAPS2 computers do benefit the society."	5	4		9																					
1726	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you know that @NUM1 in every @NUM2 @CAPS2 families own a computer? Computers can be helpful if you need to write an essay for school, but when it comes to family vs. computer the average kid will usually pick the computer. Computers are taking away family time, exercise privledges, and time spent on school on school work. ""@PERSON3, get off the computer and come play '@CAPS3' with us!"" @CAPS4 mom's will say this to childeren at least once as week, the answer that is @CAPS4 common is ""@CAPS5!"" @CAPS6 childeren from the ages of @NUM3 to @NUM4 would rather spend time on the computer weather it's playing games or talking with friends. This is on issue that needs attention. Families should start to spend more time together instead of hanging out in front of a screen. My friend @PERSON1 has a little brother that is always playing games on the computer. Whenever @PERSON1 wants to play hide and go seek with him he always finds a way out of playing with @PERSON1 play computer. Aport from spending time with family computers take away @CAPS6 kids exercise privlidges. One example is that last week it snowed and I wanted my neigbor @PERSON2 to come outside and have a snowball fight with me but, she said had to finish a level on a computer game and it was realy important. This proves that it takes away time outside alone with exercise. A walk in the park with friends sounds relaxing to @CAPS4 people except for @CAPS4 teenagers would rather talk to their friends using a computer instead of actualy spending time with them. Lastly if time is being spent staring at a screen. When does homework got done? I took a survey recently among the eighth grade and the results showed that @PERCENT1 of the people that don't do their homework are due to spending too much time on the computer. In my science class a boy named @CAPS7 never does his homework. I asked him why one day and he says it was because he was talking to his girlfriend who also never does her homework because she always has something to do on the computer. @CAPS5 time spent with family, @CAPS5 exercise getting done, @CAPS5 time to play outside, and missing homework assignment are alot to sacrifice for ""@CAPS8 one more level."" I you want to help me get childeren not spend so much time on computer, write on artical on this important issue in one of your newspaper and please consider my ideas."	4	5		9																					
1728	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I believe that there is more and more controvosy about computer and whether they benefit society or not. In my opinion, computers are a wonderful resource that will soon become a household item. I am writing to persuade you that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe computers are a good thing because they allow people access to more knowledge, they allow people to stay in contact with people they dont see very often, and they allow people to keep up and know whats going on in modern life. One reason computers are useful is that they allow people to stay in contact with people they don't see very often. Today, parents don't mind sending their children off to college as much because they can actually see them using video chat websites like @ORGANIZATION1. This feature on computers has a big impact on the life of people today. People in @LOCATION1 can talk with people in @LOCATION2. This type of often allows for people to share new and inventive things they've discovered. Another reason computers can be useful is because they help people keep in touch with modern life. Many companies are now erasing newspaper ads and putting them all on computer websites. Some companies are only selling items on their websites and shipping them to the buyers. With computers students can also get their homework done and send it to their teacher by email if they cannot make it to school that day. There is even at home colleges now where you take your class online. I believe that in a few years from now more and more people will do business with computers and more stores will sell online only. Finally the last reason I believe computers are a good idea is that they allow people access to more knowledge with the internet. There are websites soldy devoted to history and information on many things. Also there are blogging websites where people can debate on information or get questions answired by real people who @MONTH1 know a lot about the topic. Another thing on computers that helps you get informed is websites like wikipedia where people can search a topic, read history about it, and follow links to other websites if they want to pick apart the topic even more. Overall, I believe that computers area a great resource to human kind and will be used for more and more things in a few years. I believe computers are useful because they allow people access to more knowledge, the ability to keep in touch with others, and to keep in touch with modern life. I believe that in a couple years there will be liss stores on the streets and most will be online because it is much cheaper for the companies. So, most people in a couple years will be computers and use them effectively."	4	5		9																					
1729	1	"Computers have gotten more advanced over time. They have even gotten smaller and smaller, and yet people still don't understand the dangers that computers have on society and their personal life such as; stress, addiction, and cyberbulling. I am here to write about how computers are a nuisense in our lives. First and for most, computers are one of the laeding causes of stress in daily life. About four out of every ten people that are stressed are stressed out because of their computers. For example, if you were writing an important document or sending an email to your boss about work and your computer suddenly crashes, would you be upset? Would you feel like you want to rip your hair out and throw that computer out the window? I'm pretty sure that you would because your data is lost, you will have to restart your computer and, worst case senerio, take your computer to the electronic store to get it fixed. Another cause of stress is if someone hacks your computer by uploading a virus. Hacking was @CAPS1 become a world wide sport. There are books and instructions on how to hack a computer and the government can't do much about that since the first amendment gives you the write to publish what you (freedom of speech and press). Just look what happened in @LOCATION1. A computer hacker hacks a computer and shut of power to an entire city for about @NUM1 days. Also if someone upload a virus into your they can take all of your personal information, like your social security number. These two factors will cause major stress in you daily life. Secondly, people spend too much time on the computer at home. A recent survey shows that six out of every ten teenagers spend more that two hours on the computer. This make them less social meaning they won't spend time with friends, family, or even try out for sports. They won't get the recommended one hour of exercise a day."	4	4		8																					
1733	1	"I think that computer are a good benefit for people because those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. For example, they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, people and even allow people to talk with other people. My first reason, is that important people around the world used computers to have a better future on life. The people that use computers have important jobs. For example, a judge, an enginere, a lawyer, an archytecht, a scientist, an archeologist etc... This is why I think that computer are helpfull for people. My second reason, is that computer could be helpful with kids because computers could help kids get better grades at school. It could help develop a smarter brain in many ways. The first way that it could help develop a smarter brain is reading a lot on the compute. It helps by knowing the meaning of new words. I helps you speak correctly and clear. That is why I think that computers help develop a smarter brain. My third reason is that it help adult connect to different places at the world. That could be a hobby for adults that does not have something to do could have a good time. My conclusion is that with computer you could have a better life. Computers could help you get a better future."	4	4		8																					
1736	1	"@ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 you imagine the kids in schools that you yourself run not being able to research on computers? Would you be okay with kids not having the option @ORGANIZATION3 typing their homework? Do you think the adolescence @ORGANIZATION3 @LOCATION2 would want to waste paper because @ORGANIZATION3 their messy handwriting and mistakes? I would hate to live like that, and I hate to live like that, and I know my peers would agree. This is just one @ORGANIZATION3 many reasons why computers have a positive effect on people. Other reaasons include, citizens @ORGANIZATION3 the world need an easier way to communicate with each other, and some people have to work at home. I know you as a @ORGANIZATION3 would not want to upset as many people as taking away computers would. First @ORGANIZATION3 all, think about the schools that the @ORGANIZATION1 runs. Now picture this; kids turning in eight page essays to their teachers, when typing it would have taken three. Imagine those kids the night before, scribbling words away with their cramped hands, typing to write as quickly as possible. These children have no computers, and therefore their teacher will have to take the time to try and comprehend the illegibal students' handwriting. I @CAPS1 almost see the kids screaming, their eyes darting around as they struggle to finish their high priority papers. If there were no computers, then this is what would happen to children. Also, students use computers for research; learning about different parts @ORGANIZATION3 the world. As a @ORGANIZATION1, I doubt you @CAPS1 say that research is a negative affect on school kids. I mean, unless you didn't want them to learn. Secondly, I want you to close your eyes. Think @ORGANIZATION3 yourself calling your best friend who lives in @LOCATION1. He does not pick up, so you walk to your clean, shiny black computer. You hear the clickety-clack @ORGANIZATION3 the keys as you write him a message, and the wooshing sound that your moniter maes when you press send. It is kind @ORGANIZATION3 amazing how advanced our technology is, how @CAPS1 you send a message from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 in a matter @ORGANIZATION3 seconds. You couldn't possibly say that all the hard work put in to makng computers did not have a positive effect, could you? I know that I talk to my friends in @LOCATION3 all the time, but not on the telephoone. You see, my family does not have long distance calling, so if I didn't have a computer, I would never be able to talk to her. I know a lot @ORGANIZATION3 my friends have the same issue, and if not then the time difference between locatiions makes it hard to call people. Have you ever had this problem? Would you want the effect to be that you couldn't talk to some @ORGANIZATION3 your friends anymore? Most importantly, I would like to tell you a story. When @CAPS2 five, my daddy used to tuck me into bed every night. It was my favorite part @ORGANIZATION3 everyday. But then, when I was six, my dad got a job that required him to work late every night. He stopped coming home and tucking me in, and I didn't understand why, being as young as I was. I cried every night for three weeks. After those three weeks, my dad's boss told him that he could work from home... if he had a computer. His work gave him a computer, and he was back to tucking me in every night, and he still does now. If that wasn't a possible effect, then I don't know what is. Many people are able to work from home with computers, which is just another reason why computers are helpful to all citizens @ORGANIZATION3 the world. I'm you, a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION3, needs a computer to work. Although I @CAPS1 see why some people @MONTH1 oppose to computer, I completely and utterly disagree. Computers help people with working, learning, and even communication! People @MONTH1 think computers @MONTH1 cost too much, but you @CAPS1 find them for they almost any price range. I do agree that citizens should not spend too much time on the computer, but it still has a totally positive effect on people @ORGANIZATION3 the world. I know that a @ORGANIZATION3 @ORGANIZATION3 the @ORGANIZATION1 should agree."	6	5		11																					
1747	1	"Dear local Newspaper, I think computer technogily is good. I think there are mang good effects on computers. I think the computer teaches us to work onlone with no ones help. Another good effect on the computer is we can talk to friends online. Also another thing is it gives us the ability to learn about it and surf the web. Another reason is it gives us hand cordanation. All of those are the reasons why I think the computer has good effects. My first topic, why I think there are good effects on the computer is we can do work by ourselves with no ones help. My first reason why I think that is because after looking up links on it and getting use to that homework would be eaiser. Also it will help you get more information on homework and you can get a better grade. Another reason is that you will be able to work onlone you will be able to get it done faster by going on the web. My second topic why there good effects is that you can go online and talk to freinds. My first reason why I think that because if you don't have a cell phone and you wanna talk to friends you can go online. Another reason is that is good is that if you can't do somthing and our in a bind you can tell the person that you can't. Also another reason it is good because you can talk to relatives you havent seen. My last two topics are that it gives good hand cordination and we can learn to surf the web. It gives us good hand cornation because we learn how to use our hands and fingers faster. Also it gets us away from typeing. You can learn to surf the web because after a while you will know were everything is and be a web master. Lastly you will be able to find everything you look for. In conculsion these are good effects. The computer teaches us how to type, and search on the web and learn about it. As you can see these are the reasons I think it has good effect."	4	4		8																					
1753	1	"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 many hours a day do you spend on the computer? Too many is my geuss! They are warping the minds of people all over, and in my opinion things should go back to the way they used to be. Some people @MONTH1 disagree, and say that computers help children who are in school. That @MONTH1 be true, but honestly only a couple decades ago the average student didnt even own a computer, and school were teaching the same materials without the usage of them. Also, some children use computers to cheat on homework assignments and essays, and I'm sure many people would agree that that is not helping education for schools. Another reason computers @MONTH1 not benefit society is because of the dangers of them. Sexual predators sworm the internet, and many people talk to strangers over the internet that @MONTH1 be harmful, without even realizing it. A third reason computers @MONTH1 not be help society @CAPS2 you can see, I feel very strongly about the negative effects that computers have on society, for many reason.

Some people are almost addicted to their @CAPS4. I cant blame them they can charge their ipod, tweet, listen to music, palying games and much more all at the same time! computers are great, but using it too much can make you miss out on tons of activities.

1763	1	"Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1 you know that over half our nation own home computers? Recently, though, some experts have been concerned whether or not computers benefit society. I have been asked to state my opinion and I believe computers have a positive effect becuase, they are mandatory for work, allow online socialization, and expand traveling. After reading this, I am sure you will agree. Firstly, computers are mandatory to have for work and @ORGANIZATION1. Students keep their essays, study guides, and home work updates on files in the @CAPS5. Offices would not be able to function @CAPS8 computers; workers rely on the internet email system. An interviews with a student from @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""I use my @CAPS5 for everything; I would not survive the workload @CAPS8 @CAPS3."" @CAPS2 asked why, he replied, ""@CAPS3 keeps everything organized, and is an easier way to research topics."" A lawyer said, ""You can not support a client if you don't have the right tools, and a @CAPS5 is on @MONEY1 those tools."" @CAPS4, @CAPS8 computers offices would crumble and students grades would drop. Could you imagine writing a newspaper @CAPS8 a @CAPS5? Secondly internet access allows people to meet new people. Many websites such as '@CAPS6' and '@CAPS7' allow people to reconnect with old friends, and make new ones. @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 the nation owns accounts on socializing websites, and @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 the nation says their friend groups have expanded to the groups (according to a poll taken). A psychologist explains, ""Some people are too shy to meet new friends in person; online bloom."" @CAPS8 internet, citizens @MONEY1 @LOCATION1 would know little about other countries' people. My next reason, however is even greater. Lastly, @CAPS8 internet, people would do for less traveling. Internet allows citizens to research places they would like to visit and buy transportation to their destination. @CAPS3 also is an easy and effective way @MONEY1 booking where the tourist shall stay. Apoll taken by @ORGANIZATION2 airports shows that @PERCENT3 @MONEY1 the travelers book their flights online and @CAPS8 online ticketing 'the wait to book your flights would be unbearabley long; or stop travelers completely' (quote from a worker). My people and I went to various airports and train stations across the country and interviewed @NUM1 people each. We inquired about how the bought their tickets and @PERCENT4 @MONEY1 them said online. ""@CAPS9 do you mean, how? On the internet @MONEY1 course! no one could get anywhere if we stood in lines all day!"" said a person interviewed. Airports make @MONEY1 for the @LOCATION2 government, and @CAPS8 internet less people would travel. There for, computers are mandatory. Computers have a positive effect on owners; since they allow easy organization and research, online socializing and better ways @MONEY1 booking transportation. @CAPS8 computers internet access, our business would crumble, then the economy would follow. I know you agree with me."	6	6		12																					
1777	1	"Dear Newspaper, Computers have advance a lot since they were first made. Some people see computers as a way to rot your brain, while others see it has a learning device. Although computers have a negative effect when it comes to children, they have more of a positive effect because they give people the ability to learn about far away places and allow people to talk to each other online. To start off, computers are bad because they can be used as a way to babysit a child. When you're on the computer you're just sitting there staring at a screen with pictures and words on it. Some parents use the computer as a way to keep their kids quite, instead of taking the time to go outside. By growing up in an enviornment like that the children only know how to play on the computer. Kids have a lot of energy, and they need to do something productive, not play computer games and talk to their friends. All school day they talked to their friends, they need to be with family doing something to keep them fit and healthy. By using the computer as a babysitter, you as a parent are leading your child to obisity because all they do is games, and they aren't properly taking care of their body. On the other hand, computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. If your teacher gave you a last minute writing essay on @LOCATION2 that was do in a week, what would you do? You can't fly to @LOCATION2 and ask the @CAPS1 people what you want to know. That would be a waste of time and money. And if you go the library and they don't have any books, then you're in trouble. But by using the computer you can find endless information about @LOCATION2, and you could finish that essay in a day if you wanted to. Also, if you were going to @LOCATION4, but you knew nothing about @LOCATION4 you wouldn't be very confident about going. And you would feel like a tourist. But, if you went online and searched @LOCATION4, you could find the traditions, the clothing, and so much more. Lastly, if you wanted to know more about a famous person who isn't around anymore, you could go on the computer and find pictures and what they did, how they became famous, and so on. Finally, computers allow people to talk online with other people. Say your grandma lives in @LOCATION3, and you can't call to often because your phone bill will get to high, what do you do then? You talk online since you both have computers and it won't cost you to call. For example, my grandma and grandpa both live in @LOCATION1. When we call there it costs a lot because they're so far away. When they got a computer, we each bought a webcam and called them everyday on @ORGANIZATION1. Now, not only did we talk to them, but we also get to see them too. If your friend didn't have a phone and you really needed to ask them for the homework, you could go online or on aim or facebook and ask them. You know you can always get an answer because everyone is always on the computer at some point of the day. Although computers have a negative effect when it comes to children, they have more of a positive effect because they give people the ability to learn about far away people an places, and they allow you to talk online with other people."	6	5		11																					
1782	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that computers are a good source of technology. The reasons which I am fighting for tell why, kids are in school more than half of the school day. Parents should be limiting there childrens use and what they do, and computers are a way of contact and research. To begin, kids are in school more than have of a school day. How could children stay on the computer when there in school learning? They can't. In school you get alot of exercise because your always movign around. After school kids usually do homework or go out with friends. Computers don't have effect on people, if anything it makes them smarter. Secondly, if children have a computer at home their parents should be limiting the time and what exactly they could do on the computer. The people who support advances in technology are correct, computers open up imagination, and learning. Parents of the children that have computers should be more worried than anyone else and if they are , they should just take the computer away. Parents sould also take their kids places more often so the schild win not have to go online. Lastly, computers are a way of contacting others. If you don't have a phone, you use a computer to go on your email, or personal websites. Also poeple need computers for schol work and for their jobs too! Another thing numerous peopel use a computer for is research and reports. We need our information! To conclude, my thoughts are very important to consider because, mny other people would be shy to wirte this and get it published in their local newpaper! I would like to say computers are not interacting with family, friends, nature or anything of that sort. We as a whole need computers to do daily life things, without be able to go online, or save files we would be lost! So I will say again to consider my ideas. Thank you."	4	4		8																					
1783	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 several reasons on way I that advances in technology are harmful to our socitey is because it opens doors to strangers on the outside world. Its also takes you away from family and friends. Lastly it also takes you away from enjoying life outside of the internet. One of my severl reasons on way I feel advanced technology is harmful to our socitey is because it opens doors to strangers @CAPS2 teens, adult's and etc. The probem with this is that you never really know whos on the other side of that door, that chat room people can miss guide you into thinking there someone who there not. @CAPS2 example theres a show called dateline. This show is about how young teens put there selev's online and grown or young men click on a picture of you and that opens up a chat line or as I say opening a door, you dont know who's on the other side of that door. So these men online makes these teens trust them and make them feel safe if they are a friend you ""hey can I come over sometime?"" you this young teen thinking thats your friend says yea sure. Dont forget you dont see his picture so he come's over and most of three men are looking @CAPS2 a quick fix. If you know what I mean. This is what go's on during dateline t.v show just imarge how many other kids or teens are out there doing the same thing the difference is they dont get caught. Secondly on why is harmful to our socitey is because it takes you away from your family and friends. It takes you away from your kid's family because that will start to fill as if you love that computer more then them. It take you away friends because they might say hey let's go out to the mall or @CAPS2 a drink youll probably say check up on somethings online. This will one move slowly away from you, all over a computer you will start to lose the people most important to you. My last reason on why you can harm society with teconogly is because it takes you away from living your own life and doing thing's you wanna do like online is a bunch of stuff that everybody else say's is cool. Do what you think and feel is cool. @CAPS2 example if someone posted something saying @NUM1 guys lodon is so cool you gotta go there but youve always wanted to go to @LOCATION1, @CAPS3 thing is that you do get to have enough air outside like your skin will get pail and icky and this is why I feel that way. In covlsion all though some people might think that advanced tencogly is good well cleary there not because they open doors to danger, take you away from friends and family. Also it takes you away from what life has to offer."	4	4		8																					
1786	1	"Dear readers, I think that its good and bad to use the computer to much"	1	1		2																					
1787	1	Dear - Local Newspaper I agree thats computers are good for society. Without computers a lot of things couldn’t be done. Computers are sometimes the easy way out. And thats why I love them. Computers almost makes anything possible. Now say if your an elderly person and you cant get up and your bodys really bad. Well all you need is a computer. You can pay your bills online or you can get a job online or even shop online. All you need is a computer. Computers are also good if your lazy. You can just lay in bed all day and go online to work or to the mall and order things all youll have to care about is personal hygenic. Sometimes computers take a lot of stress of you. No more ignorant co-workers or no angry boss everythings a-okay. Computers are also swel because its the eazy way out. But you have to make sure you get a good computer. Not and old one because it can breakdown. Dats one reason why computers arent so good. But as i said computers are very good they might be a little pesky but ones you get the hand of them everything gonna be alright and remember you can do almost anything with a computer.	4	3		7																					
5993	3	"In the essay Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the author Joe Kurmaskie uses the features of the setting to affect the cyclist. The cyclist is affected by these features because of he sees the same setting (the dessert) for several miles, he has no water and, the road has a lot of hills. The cyclist could been affected by seeing the dessert and no scenary changes for a wahile. When you look at one same scene for hours you could start to get tired and bored with everything. So this cause him to be very drossy and bored. Also the cyclist had no water as none of the fountains were cold water. Having no water out in the dessert could make you dehydrate and faint."	1	2		2																					
5998	3	"The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the lack of water, out of date information, and rolling hills. If he had up to date information then he would probably have got water from a town that’s not empty or almost empty like a “ghost town” as the cyclist said."	2	1		2																					
5999	3	The cyclist has a couple things if he racing and the wind is blowing then theres a problem and he has to follow traffic law and ride on the right side or the road.	0	1		1																					
6002	3	"The cyclist had a very hard time geting to Yosemite National Park. This is because the sun was out, and it was in the middle of June. I was so hot out the cyclist became dehydrated faster than he would have on a cooler day. When the pumped the handle of the old rusted water pump, he said the water felt, “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. The cyclist also had to deal with a lot of ""short rolling hills"", which was much more difficult to bike on than flat roads. On top of everything else the roads were in very bad condition, so you had to watch for rocks in the road."	2	2		2																					
6003	3	"The cyclist in the story is at first confident in accepting the old men’s help, and doesn’t seem to suspect anything is wrong when he first starts out. The way the men directed him seem all going for his water supply is all in store, and the first land mark, a ghost town now, is exactly where it is supposed to be. The next “town” he hits doesn’t have anything that could replenish his diminishing water supply and he starts to feel troubled. However he was told the next town wasn’t further, so he pressed on. Then the scenery makes a drastic change, the flat roads becoming hills, the sun beating hotter- it really look like a desert after tumbleweeds even go past! The cyclist continues on, despite being very dehydrated. The next thing to come along is an old juice building that almost seems to mark him on how he has no water. He keeps on, however, and at last sees a shop where he can get water. The canging scenery sends the cyclist from confidence to worry, to hopelessness and lastly, relief."	3	3		3																					
6022	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist.The features of the setting, or nature, affect the cyclist because they are wearing her out. The cyclist is going to the city of of yosemite but some guys gave her a short cut. Through this shortcut are hills and heat and lack of water. @CAPS1 describes this by saying, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited.” @CAPS1 is excited that there is a building that @CAPS1 might get some water from. Also, @CAPS1 wiped the sweat from her eyes meaning it is hot outside and @CAPS1 is sweating and losing water. Therefore, the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6023	3	"The three most important features of the setting that effect the cyclist are the ground he is traveling, the towns he passes, and the availability of water. The ground the cyclist is riding over is important because the rougher the terrain, and the more hills there are, the more energy he must use, and the less distance he can travel. @PERSON1 is riding fine until he must travel the rolling hills which consume his energy, ehausts his water, and causes dividing hope. As he approaches towns, his hope increases but soon fades due to the realization that the town will be unable of giving him relief. When he pumps out water that tastes like “battery acid,” his hope once again diminishes. As he sees the bait and tackle shop, he knows he can make it there and that when he gets there he can recover. These three features are what effects the cyclist the most."	2	2		2																					
6034	3	"The settings that affected the cyclist were in fact ones you don’t want to be near when you are out of water and tired from pedaling. The time and place affected him greatly because there wasn’t a cool breeze in the air in June at California. He was in the middle of flat deserts and had no sense of where the part as and where civilization too so he can get some water. The quote “old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” helped you realize taking advice of direction from old people who don’t go anywhere is a bad idea. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills”. This quote shows you some terrail features that affected the cyclist. Furthermore, the cyclist realivingly found civilization with running water."	2	2		2																					
6042	3	"The cyclist is mostly affected by his lack of water. In the beginning of his ride the cyclist is confident and is striving to reach the joys of @LOCATION1. He longs for, “the cool pines and rushing rivers…” (@NUM1). Later on when the cyclist reaches the rough terrain, he starts feeling exhaustion as he depletes his water supply. A bit of relief later comes upon him after a long climb over a hill until he sees a shut down juice factory almost seeming like it was put there to tease him. His destination fills him with relief and pride, knowing that he would survive the strenuous journey."	2	2		2																					
6056	3	"The wonderful features and settings had a dramatic affect on the author. The affect was bad rather that good. First, there was the almost unbearable heat. The author had limited amount of water and used a lot of it because of the smoltering temperatures. Another feature that had a great impeidence on the author’s well being would be the lack of water in the pumps he stumbed across at the snack. Lastly would be the tar-like substance that came out of the pump when author tried to get water. There was also Brackish water in the that tasted suspiciously like Battery acid."	1	1		1																					
6058	3	"The features of the setting affect to cyclist because of where he is. The biker is in a campground in California. By saying that one could sense it is a dusty place. Also, when the story says that the “town” had been abandoned. This also tells us that the place the cyclist is in is a diserted place without many people or places to stop. The story also talks about a snake in the road. A snake in the road tells one that the town is desireted I could tell that this “town” is deserted because around here, people do not goin towns that don`t have buildings. It a snake was in the road, then the town must be empty because around here streets are busy and no snakes in the road."	2	1		2																					
6065	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the weather in California in June was hot and the water the cyclist found in the pipes was hot, as well. The text says, “Somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This affected him because he had no water to drink from. Another example is when he had to overcome tumbleweeds and snakes. The text states, “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” This was an obstacle that he had to overcome. Another example is he was deserted. The text says, “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.”"	2	2		2																					
6075	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the author changes the mood by not only telling us how the cyclist feels, but also by describing his environment. As he's leaving the “resevoir compground” he’s feeling pretty good because he’s just leaving “the serenity of an early-summer evening and he’s headed toward “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” He’s in a beautiful setting and this affects the cyclist because he’s anticipating another one. However, when he moves to the “ghost town” and the “sun was beginning to beat down” he’s less confident and becoming more doubtful about the mens advice. However, he’s still optimistic, finally it funny that it was once “a thriving little spot.” Next, when the cyclist comes to “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral” he knows that things are in bad shape and he @CAPS1 water. However, all the have is a “tarlike substance” so he moves on, having no choice. When he comes to the “rough road tumbleweeds and a ridiculously large snake” it effects the cyclist by letting him know that things are at their worst and he can either give up, or keep pushing through. I doubt it could get any worse, and so does the cyclist. Finally, at the end the cyclists enters a rather modern bathroom” and things are back to civilization for him, so he feels relaxed, relieved and much better. "	3	3		3																					
6079	3	"In the text, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. For example, the text states, “There was no one in sight, not a building, or structure of any kind.” This made the cyclist very lonely and they started to lose hope of finding water. Secondly, the text stated, ""In an ironic twist the building abandoned years easlier, by the looks of it-had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory” This made the cyclist lose more hope, after he thought the building would have people in it and he got excited. Lastly, the text states, “GRAPE AND @CAPS1’S FISH CAMP” The sight of this building gave the cyclist hope and happiness for finding a place to get a drink. The setting’s features greatly affect the cyclist's feelings."	2	3		3																					
6088	3	"The features of the setting effected the cyclist very much. The text says, “The sun was beginning to beat down”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The hot sun was making the cyclist sweat. He was losing water. This was making him dehadrayted faster. The text says. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The hills the cyclist had to ride up were wearing him out. He was getting tierd faster. The text says. “I stubled into a rather modern in bathroom and drank deeply from the sink"" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The modern bathroom had good, cold water. This allowed the cylist to drink from it. The water replenished the cyclist allowing him to regain some of his strength. Then the cyclist could carry on."	2	2		2																					
6102	3	"The cyclist trusted a man that didn`t know much about the world, he thought that the guy would know how to get to the place he was looking for. The cyclist took his advice, he thought that he would be there really soon so he start to drink his water really fast. He realized that he was out of water and the park he was going to wasen’t anywhere near. The cyclist got frustrated and angry he was now crossing the desert which was making him tiered and dehydrated. He pased this road that was a rough road with tumbleweeds and snakes he kept on going until he sow the “@CAPS1 Juice” company. He hurried there, went into the bathroom drank same water. When he got out an old men asked if he needed directions, the cyclist said no."	2	2		2																					
6108	3	"The features of the setting affects he cyclist. One way it affect the cyclist is it by being hotlike a says in the text""I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgerous day in June ""@CAPS1 way it affects the cyclist by being bumby like it says in the text ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD:DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT."" that is how the setting affects the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6109	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the mood the cyclist and what happens as he journeys in the desert to a town. For example his mood changes when the old man asks him for a map and his attitude changes by cautiousness of the new, of the new road he went on then terror when he thought he was gonna die “ I was gonna die and the birds would pick me clean” then to pride when the old man asks for a map and the author says “I own a very good map” But as he journeys to Yosemite the setting changes when he goes to a  desert type of place then goes a bait shop to rest. Then probably on his merry way to his destination."	2	2		2																					
6117	3	"There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature is the weather. When a cyclist is on a trip the weather could affect the setting greatly. An example, if it started to rain the roads could become very slippery and dangerous to ride your bike on. The cyclist and his bike could crash and die. Just cause of the weather. Another feature is the animals. An animal is important cause any were you do the are different animals that do different things. If the cyclist knows  the animals around the area that he is traveling he could keep safe and not be harmed. Ti’s better to know the area and feel safe. Then not knowing what’s going to happen next."	1	1		1																					
6120	3	"In the story there are many affects the cyclist deals with. He has to go through a lot of bad things just to finish. The cyclist has to watch out for a rough road he was going over. Also the whole time he was racing he had to watch out for diamond back snackes. Also the whole race, the cyclist biggest problem was water. He ran out quickly. And when he saw the factory and stopped. He put rocks in his mouth to make him forget about water, and lets yours split circulate. The cyclist had to go through all these problems which made it show that he had determination."	2	2		2																					
6122	3	"During the cyclist bike ride the unbearable conditions changed his attitude when he firsts starts the reader can sense frustration because of the old timers and there directions. Then as he realizes that he might have enough water his attitude changes. The cyclist goes from frustrated to loving the secenery, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,” as the conditions changed to even more unbearable heat. He decided to just give up. Until he got courage and “slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” When he saw Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, he realized he was safe."	2	2		2																					
6123	3	"The byciclist from “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed speed Limit” was effected in many ways from the environment. The most talked about feature in the environment was the lack of water. The byciclist was going to die because there was no water and he was really dehydrated. Another feature was the heat. It was really hotwhere the narrator was bycicling. When @CAPS1 hot, the heat dehydrates you. So the narrator was being pushed to the limit because of the heat. Also, everyone was gone from the towns so every town he came to was hauntinghim until he got mad at the lodgers hetalked to and was really frustrated. The smooth flat road gave way to rolling hills, which made it harder for him to ride. Lastly, the snake inthe road affected him because he had to avoid it. All of these things affected him.

6124	3	"“Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie is truly a story of man against nature. Here is a man who is completely alone except for his bike, the baron landscape and relentless sun. First he notices the sun, over head him, expected from California June, but not none the less. Then next come the rolling hills and incline in elevation, going up hill means his body working, harder, and burning calories and his much needed water supply. Then there is the man much torture. A speed limit of @NUM1,were he is going a tough 12. And worse a billboard of “a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” this truly hit his emotions, showing him exactly what it was out of reach. In this story every element of his surrounding contributed to his hoplessness."	2	3		3																					
6128	3	"During his cycling trip, the author had to endure extreme heat, face snakes, deal with little or no shade and survive a dire lack of water, all problems related to the setting of Yosemite National Park. The author, cyclist Joe Kurmaskie, writes of becoming dehydrated, and describes, “the sun was beginning to beat down and l was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 struggle for him was crossing the path of a “ridiculously large snake” and “trying to keep his balance in his dehydrates state. Kurmaskie ran out of water, due to the extreme heat, and upon reaching a water pump, finds the water to be unfit for drinking and “in the neighborhood of zoo degrees.” @CAPS1 setting-related issue for kurmaskie was the fact the area seemed deserted and he had to continue for mile until he was able to find a spot with clean water where he could rest and rehydrate."	3	2		3																					
6129	3	"The features of the setting were very affective in the story “@CAPS1’t exceed @CAPS2 Speed Limit.” It affected the cyclist because in one part of the setting it went to roling hills. That’s going to be hard to pedal a bike on. Another was the setting affected the cyclist is at one point tumbleweeds were in his way. If the gets caught on the bike it could have caused him to fall and it could harm him. Lastly, the road started getting rough up ahead which could be hard to ride over potholes and thugs like that. Therefore, the setting was affecting to the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6131	3	"In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” written by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the author in many ways. One feature was the hills.

6134	3	"Many features in the setting affect the cyclist. Several main features include the cars lading town. that aint really towns anymore, and the water pump. Both of these examples gave him hope but none gave him relief. The town he first saw could give him water, but it was all run down and weakened. “I arrived at the first “town”. This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time... refer the @NUM1 word war.” He is saying that the town could’ve given him more water and enery, but it appeared that it was over for this town. Additionally, he biked across a water pump that was well needed He tried to pump water but got no success. “I pumped the handle for several minutes but the water wouldn’t cool down.” A working water pump would’ve been huge for him giving him more strength to bike. However, once again it was very misleading"	2	2		2																					
6145	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist with his train of thought. On page @NUM1 it says, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This gives a sence of heat and foreshadows maybe the lack of water he’ll have later on. As he passes a snake, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” So the cyclist is most likely begin to feel dizzy and begins to loose hope. On page @NUM2 he says, “…I could drop from heatstroke…” meaning he’s starting to think of the worse possible things that could happen. Which effects him because he’s beginning to loose hope and  thinks he’s not going to make it. On page @NUM3, he says, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean…” By this point the conditions he was having were rough and making him worry. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist throughout the story."	2	3		3																					
6149	3	"The features of the settings in “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie were rough and challenging. A biker rides through todi, California which is a rough area to ride. The ride was hot and long that he was so dehidrated that sweat was dried around his neck. The solo cyclist says “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” He had no where to get water or food. It was deserted. He thought if he died no one would find him faster the birds would pick him clean. The essay “rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit by @PERSON1 shows a solo cycilist are very independent."	2	2		2																					
6150	3	"In the story, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faced many obstacles. For example, he had to get directions to Yosemite National Park, but the directions were from elder men, whose information was out of date. In addition, the cyclist had to decide which way to take when there was a fork in the road. He chose a path the old men said would have a town nearly eighteen miles down the road. Furthermore, the cyclist ran into flat roads that went to rolling hills, snakes blocking his path, and a dehydration state that could’ve killed him. In conclusion, this man overcame obstacles to get to Yosemite National Park."	2	2		2																					
6153	3	The affect of the setting are two old timers sitting on their front porch out in the desert since carter was in office. It was starting to become daylight and he  had to walk @NUM1 miles to get to the next town. So he gets on a bike and rides to the next town. The speed limit is 55 miles per hour and he  was going 12 miles per hour just like the waterflow. He was riding up and down rolling hills. He finally got to the next town to live.	1	2		2																					
6155	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a lot of ways. in the essay, the author describe how the setting is hot, it is bumpy, it makes him sweat, it makes him tired, he is also, running out of water from his thirst. The road gets, very rocky at one point. The narrator states “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills (Kurmaskie @NUM1). There is also a photograph that shows how rough the terrain is. It is barrain with nothing around it."	1	1		1																					
6161	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the climate could be hot, the road could be bumpy, and the town could be deserted. For example, ""Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This would be hard for a cyclist who is thirsty. And if he is not and with no water he probably could  barely make it up the hills. And with no town for water he would be thirsty.""First ""town"" This place might have been a thriving little spot at one point but anthor warning it fit the outsides of ghost town"" No waters"	2	2		2																					
6162	3	"Hot, lack of water, lost-all are how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, it was hot. In one sentence he say the sun was beginning to beat down. Also that the water felt around two-hundred degrees. That sweat was all over him. So he had to be really hot. Next, the lack of water affected him and his performence. How was because he was dieing in need of water. He tried everything to get water but made it through with almost no water. Lastly, he was lost. The map that he had was wrong and the trip wasnt what he expected. But in the end he was relifed. So even toward all these negative affects he still managed to come to positive. Basically this story is explaining how if you try your hardest, never give up, and try new things you are most likely to succeed in life and other things you @MONTH1 take part of. So try your best and make way of your life and plans in your life."	2	2		2

Ten this essay, old men give the cyclist direction, and instead of using a map, he takes their advice. However their information is out of date, and takes the cyclist through rolling hills and bumpy roads. The cyclist uses all of his energy to get to unknown towns of no importance, and with no water. The cyclist blame the old men for giving him directions that wasted his energy.

The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He ran out of water and became dehydrated through his trip. The heat has a major part of his dehydration during the bike ride.” I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I have been to California and it is hot. The trip was made even longer due to some bad directions from some old men.” Because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” The gentlemen gave him wrong directions because in their time that was right information.

6219	3	"The setting of this essay was the California desert in June. If any of the settings features affected the cyclist(which they all did) This had the biggest impact. In the fifth paragraph, the reader leaves that the author was “travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” My prior knowledge tells me that California is generally always a very hot place especially in the desert in June, the hottest month of the year This would have greatly affected the cyclist. He was riding for over fifty miles through the California desert  with a limited supply of water. This put him at a great risk for dehydration, which he tells the reader he reaches in the last time of paragraph ten. This terrain and the extremely hot conditions would make the cyclist very tired and dehydrated, making his journey to @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 all the more difficult."	2	2		2

If it was flat he wouldn’t have to really be more aware, cause with bumpy roads he has to look out for rocks, holes in the road. Another affect are the hills. He had to put out more energy than if the hills were just flat. Those are some reasons that explain the features of the setting that affect the cyclist."	2	2		2

6245	3	"The features of the setting affect the cy clist in many ways. For example the lack of water was the biggest thing. Without cool water he had nothing to reboost his energy. He would get tired out faster. Even he does find water its hot, like when he says,” brakish water feeling some where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This shows how in “the high desert of June,"" the water is all very hot. Even after he pumped the well for several minutes the water still wouldn’t cool down the hot desert had baked everything above and below ground. So when you go to get something liquid which heats and cools faster than solids it will be hot. Also the rough road made it difficult for the cyclist to travel it. We know the roads rough when he says, “large highway signs dumped out at me. It read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.

6292	3	"During the cyclist’s trip, he experienced physical and mental strain. The intense heat, rough terrain, the animals and his isolation all contributed to his strain while completing his challenging task. His isolation while cycling down the “shortcut” was a definite factor in his strain. @PERSON1 stated that, “ there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” All @PERSON1 had to focus on was accomplishing his task. There wasn’t anybody nearby to help him and there wasn’t any shelter for him to take to escape the heat. The heat itself played a very predominant factor in Kurmaskie’s physical strain. The heat caused him to become dangerously thirsty and required him to find an abundance of water fast. Kurmaskie stated, “ the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” This statement proves that the intense temperature was a life threatening factor. The rough terrain and snake and two factors in his trip that just helped make his journey even more cruel. The physical strain of avoiding a snake in the middle of the road and the dangerous terrain just put him in a more grading position. "	3	2		3

6317	3	"There are many ways in which the setting of “Rough Road ahead” affects the cyclist. First of all, he is bicycling through the desert. This poses a problem because it is very dry and hot. At one point in the story, the author writes that he was “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” It is obvious here that lack of water is affecting his in a big way. He almost collapsed because he is so thirsty. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is that he is in a very remote area. He says that “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Since there was rolling now, the cyclist had to keep cycling and drinking his water until he could find a place to stop. Lastly, the “rough road” affected the cyclist. The road made traveling even harder to do and caused the cyclist to have a very rough time. If I had to bicycle for a long period of time, I would much rather have a smooth road so I could renew my energy. The heat, remotness of the area, and the rough road all affected the cyclist on his journey. "	2	1		2																					
6336	3	"The dry desert like setting would affect the cyclist because he could easily become dehydrated from the sun, and loss of water through sweat. The cyclist states, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” (Rough Road Ahead). The man is badly dehydrated, but in his determination he moves on. The terrain went from being flat, to short rolling hills. The road had been abandoned along with the town he had passed through, hoping to get water. The man goes can to say, “ I toiled on, at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me ""(Rough Road Ahead). The setting is obviosly desert like, so it is dry, hot, and dusty. This would definately have an affect on his body which is sweating, which causes dehydration due to water loss. In conclusion the cyclist was greately affected by the setting."	3	2		3																					
6348	3	"Throughout the story, the cyclist describes the hot weather and harsh tarrens of the midwest in his quest to find a source of water.

In the story it say when he was riding that “ He barely noticed that the sun was starting to beat down.” This quote shows it was starting to get hot. Also, in the story he says “ I checked my water supply.” @CAPS1 means he’s starting to realize his waters running short.

6363	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in, “Do not Exceed posted speed Limit.” By changing him physically. He was in the California desert in the middle of June without any water left. This was taking a physical toll on him. His physical effect was making him feel hopeless as well. He says, “It was a sad hopeless laugh mind you, but at least l still had the energy to feel sorry for myself."" So the way he was suffering from dehydration physically effected his emotional state because he felt as though there was nothing he could do. Had he been in another place, for example @LOCATION2, where it does not get newly a shot as soo thon California, he would not have been suffering from dehydration, as have been in such an isolated place. His cycling could be compared to the climbers who were lost in the snow storm in @LOCATION3. Instead of dehydration and heat strone, however they suffered from hypothermia. Had they been on a different mountain, there would have been no snow storm and they would be fine. The outcome of this story and the climbers was determined by their setting."	3	2		3

6377	3	"In the essay “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting relates to how the author is feeling. At first, when the author sees the abandoned first “town” he is not too worried about it and moves on. “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” The author is okay right @CAPS1, and still has enough water. Next he starts to get low on water, and he becomes more panicked; which in return makes the day seem even hotter. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of california in June.” @CAPS1 that the author is low on water the day seems worse afterward he continues on and runs into a rattlesnake, which makes him even mere panicked “and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balanc in my dehydrated state.” @CAPS2, when he got to the bait store and drank from the sink; things didn’t seem so bad anymore and there was no more talk about water nor the heat. As a result the setting was related to the author’s moods."	3	3		3																					
6384	3	"Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. After about @NUM1 miles, when in need of water supply the cyclist found a rusty pipe which a tarlike substance came out, then a brackish water substance. While cycling, you are in need of clean water. Next, the terrain changed from being flat to very hilly. In need of water,the last thing you need is be to be challeged more. Later on down the food, there were no cars or any buildings in sile. When you are feeling the the worst, you would want someone to he near in case you fall out, but no one was in site on that road. Lostly, seeing the old welch's Grape Juice Factory would affect the cyclist. Seeing that image of a drink factory right infront of you but not business has to make them fell like he/she will never make it. These features of the setting had to affect the cyclist."	2	3		3																					
6389	3	"The features of the setting directly affects the cyclist. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This affects the cyclist because in June it is very hot and going through a desert makes it worse, so he would continue to drink water until he has no more. He is also using energy which is making him sweat and drink more water. “One ramshackle shed. Several rusty pipes and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule greeted me.” This could also cause a problem because he can’t renew his water source, which means he has to conserve it, and can’t use as much energy. Both of these things factor into the setting, in a desert with no water, affecting the cyclist more than cycling in a cold day."	2	2		2

Fear and thirst start to get to him. He says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” When the cyclist finds the bait shop he has almost lost all hope. On his way to the shop he says, “Slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” At the end, the setting makes the cyclist regain his strength as he sees the bait shop, when he sees it, he says, “Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me.” The features of the setting put the cyclist in an unsteady ride of fear, hope and confidence"	3	3		3

Hills and terrain make it harder to keep going but more of a chalange, and a good workout at the same time, the setting does affect the cyclist."	2	2		2

To his dismay, these elderly men sent him through life threatening conditions in a deserted area. As the cyclist begins his journey through the hot, June weather, he “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.'' As he continues forward, he notices that there are no buildings, cars, or people of any kind. He passes abandoned towns and creeps into the desert flat land. The flatland however, morphs into crippling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes awaiting. Not only is the terrain suddenly different, but the cyclist is rapidly deteriorating. Tiredness and lack of water make the cyclist think “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.'' It was amazing that through all this, the cyclist was able to reach a small fishing camp where he is quickly replenished. “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp'' saved the cyclist from almost certain death and him to always just use his map.

As he reached “the fork of sorts” twenty miles up the road, ""the sight was troubling to him his water supply was somewhat deterriorating, so he became a bit uncered. Finally when the cyclist read the sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the author continued to move on, but with a large chunk of his confidence gone. He was dehydrated, toned, and had lost a lot of hope after coming across all these places. When he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, he was as happy as could be, knowing he would drink some water continue his journey the next day, and not listen to old men’s directions again. Many people in stories or in real life are affected by the setting they are in. In the novel @CAPS1 of champions by @PERSON1, one of the characters named @ORGANIZATION1 went on a journey to find an art exhibition, running into many problem's on the way, which in many cases, gave him a lack of hope in reaching his destination safely."	3	3		3

At this point cyclist is very worried because its hot and he has no water, while knowing he has another @NUM3 miles to go. @NUM3 miles of rolling hills and hot sun shile seeing a “A Rough Road Ahead” sign and a diamondback snake he is sure he is going to die.

However, as he was riding, the cyclist realized that perhaps the older men’s travel advice was a little out dated. with barely any water left to hydrate himself, and being surrounded by nothing but more road and desert, the cyclist couldn’t help but laugh. “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. “At this point, the cyclist was mad at himself for not just using the map that he had brought with him instead of listening to the locals.

I chuckled…” This shows that the author is still in good spirits because he can still laugh. When “a tar like substance  oozed out of the water pump at the next stop the author became a little unsettled, as the author was running low on water. But he was still optomistic.

6484	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead” the cyclist was excited and determined to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with “His name written over them”. The rough terrain and harsh weather took its affection on the unaware cyclist. The sun, beat down on the cyclist back, he tried to ignore it, but soon the heat made him frequently drink his water away to sips to drink. The cyclist was told by the old man a town was only @NUM1 miles aways. The town was the traditional definition of a ghost town. “That probably gave the cyclist no hope for surviving of finding anyone to help him reach his destination. The conditions of the roads, the lack of water which made him see a mirage, made the cyclist not trust the words of an old man who had led him to the abandon locations he had seen. The cyclist was affected by the settings in a bad way but in the end was given a little help from a traditional map."	3	3		3																					
6487	3	"In the selection “Do not exceed posted speed limit” there are a lot of great details of the area around the cyclist. In the text, it makes it clear that the route the cyclist is traveling is very deserted when the drinking water was explained as oozing out and tasting like battery acid, you can tell that people hadn’t been there in awhile. Also, being informed that he was traveling through a desert, in June. I am able to understand how thirsty he is. Also, he is traveling for miles over a rough terrain and “crippling hills,” according to the text, so he has to be ovely exhausted. I could understand why he was so upset with getting wrong directions based on the troubles he encounters when he finally reaches the camp and drinks water, you too are glad he has reached somewhere that wasn’t empty and deserted."	2	3		3																					
6492	3	"The cyclist was biking through the California deserts olwing the warm summer months. The heat and uninhabited canal was the biggest struggle for the cyclist. For example, he thought there would be many stops for water decive his trip, but he was mistaken. Also he runs out of water very quickly because of being dehydrated in the heat. The cyclist became irritated with himself for trusting someone else to give him directions for a shortcut. The setting affected the cyclist’s mood in a negative way.  "	2	2		2																					
6494	3	"Many things caneffect a cyclist and how they ride, in this essay many things effected him such as the setting of the story. One of the problems of the setting was there were no stores or even people, another and most important thing was the lack of water around him, so many things can effect a cyclist while They are riding inculding there suriondings."	2	3		3																					
6503	3	"In the story Rough Road Ahead by Joe @PERSON1 it tells of a cyclist heading for Yosemite National Park, and the problems he faced. For example the heat was a major issue the cyclist had to face. In the story it said “Drop from heatstroke.” this shows the setting affected him in a negative way, in the story heat was a major part of the setting that affected the character."	2	1		2																					
6505	3	"As soon as the cyclist gained information about which way to go, he set off through tall, cool pines. They  gave him a feeling of confidence, and physically cooled his body down. As he headed down the road, he encountered various small towns-none of which looked promising- which gave him a feeling of despair, in accordance to his lack of water. Even further  into. the journey, he found one last town, and arundown welche’s  @CAPS1 factory. This increased his thirst and gave him a feeling of spite towards the old men who had given him advice. However, he soon found a bait house where he could get water and escape the heat. For this he was satisfied and grateful to the owner. It made him realize to never again trust the old men."	3	3		3																					
6511	3	"There were many features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One was the extreme heat during the June heat in California. The speaker said that he could have died from heatstroke. The rough road was also a problem for the cyclist. The bumps, hills and wildlife affected the cyclist’s journey. The thing that most affected him was the lack of water. It was such a problem that he had to suck on stones to take his mind off thirst. As you can see, these problems in the story affected the speaker’s journey to Yosemite National Park."	2	2		2																					
6518	3	The features of the setting affected the cycalist in many bad ways. For example in the text it says how “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”. Meaning that he had trouble being in a place he didn’t know well of and he was dehydrated. In conclusion the setting did affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
6521	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is going to be on the road a long time. The features of no buildings, no people and no cars, affect on the rider is that he feels helpless when he is low on water. The ghost town doesn’t help he because the old man told him about it and he thought he would be able to get more water. The grape juice factory affected him because he thought he would get a drink but it was abanded. This is how the features affect the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6524	3	"The features of the setting greatly impacted the cyclist. First the setting at the middle of the story was empty and no place to get water. This filled the cyclist with doubt and despair, he/she thought they would die. The setting also made the cyclist thirsty because of the extreme heat. Finally the cyclist was filled with regret because they regretted listening to the old men because the cyclist didn’t make it where he/she wanted to go."	2	2		2																					
6541	3	"The setting can affect a cyclist in a lot of ways. One way setting affects cyclist is when it is hot, it is harder to cycle long distances. I say this because in the story the narrator says “…and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke…” @CAPS1 part of setting that affects cyclist is the terrain they cycle on. For example it is much easy to cycle on flat smooth ground than it is on the rolling hills with rough, rocky ground. This is shown with the quote “…ride down into distances I could see over the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” Setting can have a great deal of affect on a cyclist, depending on if its smooth or rocky, or hot or cool. "	2	2		2																					
6543	3	"The cyclist in the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is about a great adventure gone bad. He has every thing he needs but some how it turns out bad. He get low on water & the setting is horrible. He is on his way from a camp ground in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 to the Yosemite river. He gets bad directions from old guys at the camps ground. On his way he ran into two abandon towns & was running out of water then he came to a sign that said, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” He was pedeling over hills & becoming dehydrated when he tought he was going to die he came to a bait shop & got waiter & met an old guy who was going to give him direction & he decided he better stick to the map. Even though the setting got worse through the story & stuck it out & made it to the end."	3	2		3																					
6545	3	The cyclist is in the desert which @NUM1 degrees with water that tastes like the battery acid. The desert makes him see the mirages having sweat get into his eyes. In the story  “Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie 	1	1		1																					
6548	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way it affected him was time because of the road he had to go slower so took him longer to get to the town. Also because the road was harder to peddle on he got thristy and the water was really hot.	1	1		1																					
6559	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance the desert is not a hummid making is lack of water a bigger deal than normal. Also these are many hill making him have to use full force to get up them also making water a big deal. In conclusion I temperatures where level and it was flat land he could go further with less water supply.	2	2		2																					
6562	3	"In “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie: c, I think that e the setting affected the cyclist because he was thirsty and he thought he was going to die In this case he had no water left and he was in the desert. He was regreating not taking the advice of the stranger and was dieing of thirst. Also he dident have the mind set that he wanted to live. Thats how I think the setting affectd him.

6565	3	"Some of the feature setting that effect the cyclist was the seal was begging to lent down, but he truly noticed it and about twenty miles up the road he came to park of sorts. The cyclist was riding through the high deserts of California in June. He get on his hands and hence working on the heated handle of the rusty pump. The pump began it shoot out a tarlike substance and the water was feeling somewhere of two hundred degrees. Two more miles I noticed the terrain changing from a flat road to a short, rolling hills.” He said tumble weeds crossed her path and a large snake crossed her pavement. He gather some pebbles and stuck them in his mouth, after reading that if sucking of stones helps to be your mind off thirst. Well after reading of I believed these settings did effect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6570	3	"The features oF the bike ride to Yosemite through California in June affect the cyclist. Some of the features were it was hot high deserts, and no water. This affected the author by making him dehydrated and tired, which made it hard for him to find water or to get to Yosemite. In this cass the outhor says “The sun was beating down on me”. The author is hot From the sun. He says “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips”. He is showing how he hasno water and is probably dehydrated. All of those features are affecting the way he is traveling and getting to water.  "	2	2		2																					
6575	3	"The setting affects the cyclist in almost everything he does and everything he faces. The setting is a hot day in June in the dessert. There are many hills and the terrain changes a few times. Because the day is hot the cyclist drinks lots of water. And because he drinks lots of water he very soon runs out. In the story it states, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June. This quote shows that because it was so hot, the cyclist drank lots of water and because he drank lots of water he very quickly run out of water. Also in the story it states, “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote suggests that becaused the terrain changed to hills, the cyclist became very tired and hot from having to pedal up and down those hills. And because this caused him become hot and tired he also drank his water more quickly than if he was pedaling on a flat paved road in a cool day in @DATE1. In conclusion the setting causes the cyclist to become tired, hot, and thirsty, which affects his entire journey."	3	2		3																					
6581	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the cyclist is tired and thirsty already. The features include a desert like setting of California, it is extremely hot, there are no signs of civilization in sight, and the roads are like hills that always were throughout the desert. On top of those facts the cyclist is dehydrating because his water suposely has diminished. "	1	1		1																					
6586	3	"When the biker listened to the old folks he had confidence. He biked to the first town but it was like a “ghost town.” A town is a town. soon after that, he did not see anything. No cars, buildings, or anything. He was getting sad and dehydrated. The old men swore there was a town coming up so he put his trust and confidence in him once again. He saw a building  coming up, but it was just an old wore down factory. He thought he was let down. He was sure he was going to die, right there right now. He than saw a siga for a fish comp! He was overjoyed! The place was real to! He thought of them as his savior! The settings effect the cyclist tremendously."	1	2		2																					
6589	3	"The setting in the story was hot. The biker was sweating a lot. The whole town was empty. He pasted empty buildings. Their were rivers and big hills that he had to ride through. As it says about the buildings, “somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” The setting would affect the cyclist because their was no one in the town. Also, their was high hills."	1	1		1																					
6595	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist because. It was a lack of the water and he was in the high deserts or California .For example in the text stated “when I tried a drop or two, it  had the flovor of battery acid. That showed clearly when he tried to get water from a pump what it clearly came out as the settling was extremely hot and made the cyclist misreable in such ways."	1	1		1																					
6597	3	"In many real-life situations, nature or a setting can be the biggest hindrance in succeeding, or even surviving. For example, the cyclist with stood the blozing heat of the sun as he pedaled through what seemed to be the @CAPS1’s living room: Dry, desolate, and extremely scornful. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” @CAPS2 and depicts the intense heats of the desert. Another feature in the setting was the every hanging hills and steps though pedaling down the hills was an easier task, traveling up the hill, as well  as maneuvering the thirsts and bends served as a direct conflict. An example, “with what I believed was my last burst of energy I maneuvered a setting affect a situation is ultimately, the cyclist reached his destination is great relief. But the biggest hindrance was along his setting.                        "	3	3		3																					
6601	3	"Through most the story, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a more negative way. For instance, he makes it to this town a guy swore was there, but it turned out to be abandoned. So he let out a sad, hopeless laugh and still had energy to feel sorry for himself. Another feature was the Grape Juice Factory, also abandoned, so he hung his head and that blues tune “summer time” rattled in his brain. A third feature was his thirst. So he stuck some pepples in his mouth to take his mind off it. Then he thought about how lucky he’d be if he checked, @CAPS1 negative to me."	2	2		2																					
6604	3	The setting in the begining of the story is flat an easy but as the path becomes unfamiliar it turns into many hills & turns. This effects the cyclist a lot because he was low on water & was begining to become dehydrated.	2	2		2																					
6606	3	"The cyclist has to over come a lot of obstacles. For example, there is a snake in his path, so he cationly rides around it. Also, there are alot of hills and he wasn’t sure if he could make it up those hills. Furthermore, he is almost out of water so he could die of heatstroke or dehidration. In conclusion he over comes these obsticles and achieves his goal. "	2	1		2																					
6607	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” the author goes through many seneries. All of the places that the author goes to make him even more determined because he wants to find water and he just wants to get to Yosemite. The determination pushes him to keep going further and further. And then the determination finally pays off after he goes around a turn because he then see’s a place where he can get something to drink and a place to cool down.	2	1		2																					
6610	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he get tiring. The character, in the story is ridding his bike for a long period of time and he gets tired. He rides alone with nothing or none around his accept the tries and wild animals."	1	1		1																					
6613	3	"The hills and bumpy road slow him down, and he is dehydrated. That is also slowing him down because he needs water. There are obsticles in the road too, such as, the big snake laying across the middle of the road. He is lost without water and could possibly die of an heatstroke."	1	1		1																					
6617	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The temperature in the area affect the way he drinks his water which leads him to thinking he is going to die because he is running out of water. The “towns” he comes to are so deserted he thinks he is going in the wrong direction. All the settings in the story also help him not to give up but keep on going. In conclusion even though he had to go through all that doubt he was going to be alive in the end he still went on and tried. In the end he did make it and all it was worth it.	2	2		2																					
6622	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it was June and the cyclist had little water. The cyclist was dehydrated and couldn’t find any building or water for many miles. The cyclist took advice from oldtimers which didn’t know what they were talking about. In conclusion, the weather and the location affected the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6628	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. The landscape was hard to ride on, there was intense heat & little water. As a result, it was a long trip and he had a difficult time reaching his destination."	1	1		1																					
6636	3	"The features of the setting gradually contribute to the cyclist’s anger. For example, at the beginning of the story, the cyclist comes across poisonous snakes, “one ramshacke shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule.” All of sights trouble the narrator, and he starts to becom frightened and neurotic. As he cycles on, the narrator begins to deplete his water supply, and when he stops to restock, “the water wouldn’t cool down” and “it had the flavor of battery acid. The cyclist’s lack of water frustrates him, and the increasing steepness of the hills adds to his annoyance. The final straw came when the cyclist passed by what he thought “had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory.” The narrator goes on in an outrage to explain that hopes to die out on the road, in order to spare himself from the dreaded features of the setting.  "	3	2		3																					
6637	3	"The features in the setting most definetly affect the cyclist while he travels. The cyclist is incredibly thirsty and tired and the setting he’s placed in just gives him no hope of survival really. He first comes to a “ghost town” where he finds no one is living. This first encounter with isolation in a desolute place doesn’t really affect him because it is the first place he finds but the rest of the storys setting comes to mimic this. As he travels he is met with barren land, no water and no people in sight. It’s June in California and the cyclist fears he @MONTH1 soon suffer from heat stroke if he doesn’t find water yet. It doesn’t help when he comes to an abandoned juice factory that taunts him with the one thing he needs to survive. All in all the features in the setting make the cyclist lose hope, make him feel like he will die if he dosen’t find water."	2	3		3																					
6646	3	"Joe Kurmaskie had a rough time trying to get to Yosemite National park. First, he received directions from an old man, Joe followed these instructions; little did he know that he would be headed for many hardships. After he reached the first town he checked his supply. About @NUM1 more miles he reliced his bottle was getting low because he was travelling through the high deserts of California. It is hot cool out there,then the terrain changed. He no longer had that much water. He ran into a snake, which he swore was a alamond back. Finally, he came to another town, got some water and then left after going through ghost towns. Riding in conditions that are hot and unfamiliar are hard to do. Adding hills to heat is not a good combination, with nothing around val it can be very dangerais, even fatal. Before you bike thinkof what conditions are ahead of you"	3	2		3																					
6648	3	"Each time the author comes to a point where the setting isn’t very appealing or helpful, he loses hope for reaching his destination or finding a nice place to rest and get some fresh water. For example, the text states, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The author has a sort of negative, sarcastic tone at this point. This shows that he’s getting frustrated and losing some hope. He also mentions that the “sight was troubling” which shows how big of an affect the features around him or scenery can have."	2	2		2																					
6661	3	"In the essay, the cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting. Under the conditions he could barely survive and make it to his destination. It is clear that the features of the setting are affecting him when he states,“The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cruel.” In his efforts he is slowly getting weaker and the sign he sees only makes him feel worse because it seems to him that it mocking him. He also states, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and ledge one in my throat.” This shows he is ready to give up completely and wouldn’t care if he died. From the author’s tone, it is clear that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist."	3	2		3																					
6667	3	"Snake, heat, hills-all are what the biker had to deal with because of certain settings. He had to deal with a diamond back. He was going through the desert so it was like @NUM1 degrees. While he was biking he had to go up crippling hills. He had a redicuious setting to have to bike with. I would never be able to do what he did."	1	1		1																					
6669	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, written by Joe Kurmaskie, the author describes the setting as hot, tiresome, and aqusting. You get this picture from the author when the bikerider is describing his surroundings. The bikerider describes his as the high desserts of California in June, being hot and musky, ruff terrain, etc. This gives you an image of what the bike rider feels physically and emotionally. This image shows how tired, thirsty, and determined the bikerider really is. Using words, metaphors, and imagery the author puts you in the shoes of the bikerider emotionally and physically."	3	0		3																					
6670	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the people around the area of @LOCATION1. Taking advice from older people in open landed place can affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
6675	3	"In “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist by making him doubtfull. The cyclist is doubtfull that he won’t make it to Yosemite National Park. ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the bivas would pick me clean, leaving only some expenses outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom and their keen senses of direction.” This shows how he is doubtful. Finally in the story the cyclist doesn’t think that they will make it."	2	2		2																					
6676	3	"In the passage, the features of the setting affect the cyclist because every time he comes along something different a new idea about his survival comes into his head. First, when the cyclist sees the mule he says, “This sight was troubling,” he is now troubled by the fact that he had not seen a town yet and starting to doubt the old mens advise. Also, when he sees the juice factory he puts some pebbles in his mouth and says, “It didn’t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This shows that seeing the broken down juice factory gave him no hope and he tells his self that he will die."	2	2		2																					
6686	3	Different settings can effect how well your bycycle ride goes. If it is hot and you have lots of hills it makes it hard. If you have no hills and it is a sunny breezy day it makes it nice to ride. In the essay the biker had no water left but was going down a hill. The going down the hill part was probably easy but the fact that he had no water left was not a good thing.	2	3		3																					
6692	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he can’t go any farther because of the hills, and the snake. When he finds the bait shop he’s relieved. He relieved because he can get something to drink. He can also buy the worms to eat. The cyclist didn’t really know where he was going because there wasn’t a car, building, or structure in sight. So the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first “town” as he calls it in the essay. When he comes across the road that has 55 mph per limit, and he’s only 12 he knows that he’s not going anywhere near Yosemite National Park."	2	2		2																					
6694	3	"The different settings in the essay/ writing affect the cyclist because of how old and hopeless they look. I think this because when the cyclist stops at the first town, he’s looking around expecting to find a quaint, bustling little place, but instead he finds these abandoned, decimated old houses. And if you yourself can picture being in his situation, then you can imagine how discouraging and almost frightening that must be. As the cyclist continues for a few more miles, he’s becoming slowly dehydrated, and finally sees a building. At first, he thinks this building is a mirage; he was wrong, but for him in this situation it was worse- an old juice factory, right when point you kind of get the feeling that every things turning against you and that there’s no hope left. But when he finds the fishing camp, his entire perspective of things changes, and he just feels so thankful to have been saved."	3	3		3																					
6695	3	The setting affected the cyclist by the people from Lodi get him into the wrong way and he had to survive from there so he that was very dry and No water or nothing to the next stop was at the bait store so he was determined to get to next stop destination by he did want to give up own but the guy ask him did he want direction he said he was not going to be fooled twice.	1	1		1																					
6697	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. It was so hot where he was that he kept drinking his water without realizing it until he only had a couple of sips left. The terrain also made him thirsty because the more he had to go up and down hills, the more he would drink. The fact that he did not see any town except on ghost town for miles affected him because he did not think he was going to make it to the next town. The setting played a major role on the cyclist because it affected him that much."	2	2		2																					
6702	3	The setting effects the rider because if it’s hot you get thirsty and you have no water.This kind of question is hard to answer	1	1		1																					
6707	3	"The harsh features at the setting affect the cyclist by hindering his journey to Yosemite National Park. As the cyclist is traveling along “The high deserts of California in June”, some problems arise. The heat from the pounding sun in the desert takes a toll on the cyclist causing him to drink more water and rapidly deplet his supply. The cyclist is also traveling through small “gost towns” rather than stoping at appropriate rest stops in order to refill with water and relax etc. Also while refilling he encounters hazards such as “Short rolling hills” through ghost the terrain and ever a snake. All of these features in the setting impare the cyclists ability to maintain confidence in wether he will make it to his destination and his positive attitude toward the journey etc."	2	3		3

6712	3	"In this essay by Joe Kurmaskie, a young man is baited into accepting outdated information by a group of old men. He pays for it later when on his bicycle, he is almost killed by heatstroke or dehydration. The setting is an excellent way to portray his feelings of hopelessness, despair, and fatigue. While he is just starting out, the road is flat and easy. It is cool and breezy. When he begins to run out of water, the terrain becomes bumpier and harder. He sees empty plains, cracked, dry ground, and the hot sun. He begins to despair even more. After a while when he thinks he can go no more he sees a store that once held gallons of grape juice. He laughs at the irony. The setting does do a wonderful job of describing his sense of helplessness."	3	3		3																					
6719	3	"The features of a setting can affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, while he was riding in the hot sun he became very thirsty because whe only had a few drops of water left. That is how the setting can affect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
6720	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. They make it hard to concentrate, because its heat, they make it unbearable. The setting has the affect of drowsiness and thirst, “Dry bitter lnad, longing, longing."	1	1		1																					
6729	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because where they were.It was like in te middle of nowhere and every person they asked are having all times.They go the wrong directions to the nearest town.The old guy told him it was @NUM1 miles down the road when he went @NUM2 miles to the next town and said to him self he will never take directions from a gut that has all timers and hasn’t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office.	1	1		1																					
6731	3	I think that the setting made him find more courage inside him self to save his water and go to the next town with out any water.	1	1		1																					
6733	3	"As the cyclist makes his journey towards Yosemite, the setting causes him much worry and concern. In the beginning, the narrator is content and excited. He is doing something that be lovers, is heading for a beautiful destination, and has found a short cut to save him hours of time. He is confidentin the directions given to him by the old men. However, as he continues down the winding road, his environment makes him doubt theirjudgement. The first town he comes to is entirely deserted.Though at first he laughs it off, he laster realizes just how much trouble he in if he didn't come to a civilization soon. The cyclist runs across ""ramshackle shed[s]"" and shut down factories, and as his water supply sinks lower, the road seems to tantalize him. He passes a water pump (just what he needs), yet the water is something close to toxic. A road sign reminds him not go too fast, though he @MONTH1 die if he doesn't pick up the pace. He is forced to look at a picture ofa happy boy guzzling grape juice as he dehydrates. All there features of the setting, in addition to the overpowering heat and sun, drive the narrator to the breaking point.      "	3	3		3																					
6740	3	"In this story it is clear how difficult the cyclists journey is. He has to conquer wrong directions, lack of water, rattle snakes and fear of dieng. However he shows great determination and control. An example of his determination is “The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. “This shows his determination that he feels he can go on such a long journey. An example of his self-control is shown in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. When finding this building to be abandoned, and all things, juice, anyone use would have become frustrated and wanted to give up. But not this cyclist he controlled his anger and again showed determination. And it paid off in the end he found his water and survived.

Also in the text, when, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view,” hope was replenished into the cyclist.

The cyclist reveals this when he describes, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,” aid againg  It read: Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly, He had thought that he would have stops on the way to get water from. So he drank all the rate he wanted. He then figured out the needed to conserve it but by then it was too late.

But he soon became very troubled when he became aware of the several rusty pumps and a weak corral, next to a ramshackle shed. The cyclist additionally experienced a bit of irony as he approached the 55 mph speed limit sign complete with a warning to strictly obey it. On his bicycle, at a pace of 12 mph, he could not even reach the 55 mph speed if he had wanted to. Before he reached what appeared to be an abandoned welch’s Grape Juice factory, the cyclist felt this twisted amusement yet again, as he laughed. The text states, “It was a sad hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” @CAPS1, his suffering was through when he discovered a “fish camp,” with a modern bathroom and working sinks. The cyclist’s relief was so immense that he,” had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber (the owners), (and) kiss them."	1	1		1

The line “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” shows that he is drinking a lot of water and is running low. Another feature is that he is riding in the high deserts of California in June. The story says “and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Not only is it in June, but it adds heat because he is also in a desert. There is no doubt he will get dehydrated.

He starts cycling the next morning and he is thinking of Yosemite, he is relaxed and confident however, his attitude about the day changes greatly when he comes across the rumshackle old shed, rusty pumps, and a corral at the park in the road. He becomes a little worried but he is not discouraged. When the terrain changes, he is a little discouraged. Then, when he comes across the abandoned factory, he is most definately a lot discouraged. A little later he comes across @PERSON1’s Fish camp, he is very relieved and thankful to the owners.

The second offered only water that slightly resembled battery acid. The cyclist soon becomes exhausted from lack of water and having to cross the now hilly terrain. He barely makes it to the third town to realize that the juice factory was out of business. The cyclist becomes sure that he is going to die of lack of water when he stumbles across a bait store.

The lack of water almost puts him into a heat stroke as he is determined to leave the desert, riding his bike all alone. A grope juice factory taunts him, mocks him, but he continues on, with a steady pace. The desert roads are rocky and bumpy and his lousy 12 mph speed is getting him practically nowhere.

He pedaled on, but began to run out of water when he arrived at a well, he found the water to be inedible, and continued. Just as if things couldn’t get any worse his trail was getting rougher, and his water supply was low. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated, and began to lose hope. He became even more of a pessimist when “a ridiculously large snake- blocked the majority of the pavement…” He kept going, and excitedly pedaled toward a building, but found it to be abandoned.

6941	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he had limited water, he had to peddle harder to get up over the hills and he was getting dehydrated from the heat. For example, he had limited water because he had taken the directions from the old men and probably didn’t bring as much as he would have if he would have taken a longer way. Furthermore, to get up the rolling hills he had to peddle faster and harder. That affected him because he would have been more exhausted from peddling.

Next the story says, “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”, California’s temperature is really high and June is one of the hottest months of the year. The temperature was very high and the cyclist did not have much water left. This was affecting the cyclist because he was tired, hot, and getting dehydrated. Finally, at the end of the story the terrains were changing and there had been more hills and a road that was not as smooth as pavement because it was a dirt road and the hills were making the cyclist have to cycle harder to go past making him very tired.

He had been very tired. The terrain had made him drenched in sweat. If it wasn’t so hot, then he wouldn’t of had that much of a hard time. The desert contains a very high temperature, which makes it harder to endure physical activities. Even if you are to have a high endurance.

Then again, if its too cold, breathing gets really hard. The biker in the story was in desert area in june, so it was really hot & tiring. Also, the terrain as affects a clyclist. If the road is filled with hills getting up those hills is difficult. If it’s all down hill, it’s really easy, but all uphill is hard, level terrain is fairly easy. The cyclist in the story was in level terain, then it turned into a lot of hills which tired him out. Features of the setting really affect a cyclist"	2	1		2

As he started to head out the scenery changed. “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is hinting at the fact that maybe this town he is going to @MONTH1 be abandoned or not used. He saw a huge rattle snake and tumbleweed. Which are usual signs of a desert. It was hard for him to keep his balance as he says, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” He ended up getting to the point where he had to put rocks in his mouth to trick his mind that he wasnt thirsty anymore."	2	2		2

The roads went up, down, there were hills, there were towns-ghost towns at that. The only water he could pump from the pump was scalding hot and tasted acidic. Also, he wouldn’t have lost as much energy if it was a straight shot. It’s easy to say that he literally roughed it, having to resort to putting rocks in his mouth to circulate saliva. All in all, he was very determined to work through the very unfortunate conditions he had working against him, and very lucky to survive it. "	2	3		3

The more hills, the more energy lost, the more tired he became. The desert was also hot, and dry. Obviously, since he was in the ""deserts of California in June."" @CAPS1 the would make him become thirsty. He did stop for water but a ""tarlike substance"" came out instead.

The rusty water pump, highway sign and abandoned juice factory all seemed to make his trip more difficult than it already was. First of all, when the author stumbles along a “ramshackle shed” surrounded by “several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lames mule”, he is anylous to check the pump for well-needed water. When he finds that he is out of luck and cannot drink the bitter tasting water, his hope droop a little. It is as if the sun were taunting him, telling him that he can’t make it. Secondly, he passes a large road sign reading “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. Once again he begins to feel hopeless, but then turns his angst into determination to finish his journey. He says “sometimes life can be so cruel” as he notices the speed limit to be @NUM1, but he continues on, pedaling hard. Lastly, the author sees a lone building in the distance and almost doesn’t believe his eyes. It turns out to be not only his last hope for water, but an abandoned grape juice factory. He reflect on the irony of his position by saying that his situation “should please all sadists” reading about it. Therefore, the features of the setting affected the reader by highlighting the negativity of his situation, which in turn drives him to continue pedaling."	3	3		3

That all the towns we past through were ghost towns with no running fresh water, so this extremely dissapointed him, it also furthered his dehydration. Just when the cyclist was losing hope he found a small bait shop and got into the shade and finnaly got water to drink.

The desert that he was in. also happened to be desserted and there was no one around to help him with the directions. The worst thing would have to be that he ran out of water.

The terrain he had to go through was unbearable and could almost kill him without water. Luckily he had faith and determined so he got through it and learned a lesion.

The sun was also beggining to heat down on him which means that he was going to have a hot ride to the town and which later caused his struggle for water. Overall, the hot, desert setting affects the cyclist. It causes him to dehydrate and have a need for water. In the story it says, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips” and that he could drop from a heatstroke on a beautiful day in June, This is basically showing that the hot environment caused him to drink a lot of water, and now he has run low which could cause him to have a heat stroke."	2	2		2

Second, dessert because the narrator is the only one around and deserts are usually diserted. For example the narrator exclaims “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind.” @CAPS1 clearly states that he could be in a dessert where no one wants to be. Lastly, humidity, because it can be hot but then the humidity comes into plan and makes the sky more dry and seen hotter than it usually is.

Seeing that the last attempt of direction had caused the cyclist to become nearly delicious, the setting had added severly to the problem. The beating sun and high desserts in California in the middle of June made the cyclist dehydrated and tired. When he come to a rusted water pump “black tar oozed out, you can picture the cyclist as furious and anxious and of course thirsty. The rough terrain and tumble weeds had caused the cyclist to feel skeptical of his decision to follow the old mens-directions."	3	2		3

When he first begins he doesn’t even notice how hot it is and he says, “the ran was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” His mood starts to change very quickly. Soon he drinks most of his water of becomes increasingly tired. He finds a water pump which irriates him when he realize the water tastes like “battery acid.” As he continues he sees a snake which he could swear was a diamond back so he slowly goes by out. When he notices a factory he uses his last bit of energy to reach it only to be discouraged when he finds it abandone. His spirits finally rise when he finds a store and drinks a good amount of water."	2	2		2																					
7386	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist are. The hills that the cyclisit has to go over and the heat. The heat is making the cyclist sweat alot so he is loosing fluids and he starts to got dyhydrated. The hills are making him have to work harder and getting more tired.	1	1		1																					
7387	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. They affected his confidence, his energy, and his determination. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist is very confident. This is show when he says.” The cool pined and rushing rivers of yosemite has my name written all over them. This shows confidence because he knows he can make it to yosemite.When he runs out of water he begins to lose confidence and thinks he way die. Since he ran out of water because of the heat, his energy is also dropped. You know he’s running out of water when he says.“The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” @CAPS1, after lose of water and confidence; he actually had higher determination to make it to Yosemite. This is human nature because our bodies when into survivor mode and become determined to survive. As you can see the cyclist was affected in many ways by the features of the setting."	3	2		3																					
7393	3	"The conditions in the California desert were horrible for a cyclist. The temperature was extremely high and the humidity was very dry. The roads also had a lot of hills and when a cyclist has to use his energy in the heat to go up and down hill after hill, it can be very hard. There were also no stops to refill his water a long the way,which is bad because the neat,lack of water,and all of his energy extension leads to major dehydration.The conditions along this trip are not good for a cyclist and can be very dangerous."	2	2		2																					
7396	3	"In ‘Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie the main character faces a lot of trouble. First people give him the wrong directions. But, worst of all he has to travel a lot of mile on a bike through extreme temperatures. Going up and down hills and pedaling really hard. He doesn’t even have any cool water. As the character says, “…followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees (kurmaskie @NUM1). That kind of water didn’t help him either. It didn’t quench his thirst because it was so hot, he said it tasted like battery acid. But, finally he worked up his confidence and kept pedalig till he found a fish camp that had a bathroom with a sink that had cool water. Then he headed off to Yosemite and didn’t take anyone’s advice."	3	2		3																					
7399	3	"The cyclist was motivated to get the job done. When they   said only “    eighteen miles down the road.” He thought it was going to be forever but he made it because he “conserved his water ...” and last kept on going, when the road   turned into a rocky gravel road, he still kept on going, but it was harder on his legs and water supply."	1	1		1																					
7407	3	"The countries of the setting that had the most effect on the cyclist were the deserts and hills. The author tells us first of his depleting water supply as he journeys through the high deserts of California in June. “The hills had a major effect on him because the intensive host that any desert contains, with this heat, his limited water, and the fact that it was June. I’m sure the author was most a happy person traveling within his intensive journey. Another misfortune that the author explains is the touring changing.” That road was replaced by a host rolling hills. “With my own experience, I know these cannot be a worse kind. Tall steep hills are a difficult climb, but your a living house the luxurious most to cool. In his mind too with, the author’s “Short, rolling hills”, the climb gets more miserable with every hill, and the coast down the other side barely cools your bare skin, leaving your thiving soul to continue in this dep pain. I’m sure the cyclist was experiencing a burned out spirit after just a few of those deadly hills.    "	3	3		3																					
7417	3	"The settings affect the cyclist in more than one way. These ways are that he is running out of water, he might become dehydrated and he is unsure of the path he is on. With him running out of water, he is in real trouble. Because of the lack of water, not only might be die but he begins to see mirages. His lack of water eventually leads to dehydration and he become uneasy about things. For example; in the text it says that he staggered into the store. Because he is unsure of the path he is on, he begins to panic a little. Panicing isn’t good especially considering that he is running low on water and is becoming dehydrated. Panic can’t help to solve anything. The setting is in a dessert so he needs lets of water, which he runs low on. Desserts are extremly hot which causes a person to become dehydrated or die. Desserts have little shade, if any; and they have rough weather as well as rough landscape. For example, they’re landscape is mostly all hot sand. Therefore, the setting does affect the cyclist."	3	2		3																					
7424	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He always kept his head up and was determined to make it to his destination. The first problem was when he came to the “fork of sorts” as he put it. He needed more water, but the pumps were rusty and all he could get out of them was a tarlike substance followed by blackish water. He tested it, hoping it was better than it looked, but it wasn’t. It tasted like battery acid. He was very thirsty, but had to move on, looking for another water supply. Another problem that occured was, while he was becoming dehydrated more & more by the minute and unsteady on his bike, a huge snake lay across the road. He had to slowly maneuver around it, though it was hard, he was successful and continued down the road. The third ""obstacle"" he ran into was he was so thirsty and finally had a chance for a drink, when to his dissappointment, he found an old abandoned welches grape juice factory. As nervie and upsetting as it was, he continued to move on, still determined to make it to his destination. He finally came up to a fishing supply store where he was able to take a break and get a nice drink! Even though the setting was tough, teasing, and ironic, the man made it through and still with a smile on his face."	3	3		3

7437	3	"There are many things that can affect a cyclist's journey. This cyclist seemed to have bad wick. He starts off mentioning that he is planning a trip to Yosemite and the men that hear this give him a tip. The cyclist is pretty confident in what they tell him, so he follows their suggestions. He ends up getting lost. The cyclist is also travelling in the “high deserts of California in June.” That means that he is travelling in summer with dry air. When he gets to the first “town” he sees, he can it get the water he needs to rehydrate his body. He also runs into a snake while travelling through the desert, which slows him down. Because it’s hot, and he’s tired, he begins to see mirages that affect him. All of these features cause the cyclists to take one long, tiring journey through the desert. These features also taught him the lesson to not take advise from old men who have not left their porch because their information @MONTH1 be out of date."	2	2		2																					
7439	3	"In the “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the main characters, the cyclist. After he first journied from the house where he met the old men, he rode over much flat desert terrain, where the sun beat down and dehydrated him. Soon, though the terrain changed. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This tests his endurance even more as he has to maneuver down the hills while dehydrated and ready to collapse from exhaustion."	2	2		2																					
7461	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because sometimes, it made him lose some courage and optimism. “and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day” This is an example of how he lost courage. I wanted to be brave and be strong. But the hot day and all the sweat made the author feel weak. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear” This is an example of how the author lost some optimism. He didn’t want to die, but he kept telling himself that he was going to , he should have thought to himself that he was going it make it, but the setting was just to rough. There were bumps along his ride, and the sun beating down his thirst, he became less courageous and less optimistic."	2	2		2																					
7468	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was out of water in a desert like environment and their was no one ground for most of it so he was down on his own. The cyclist was affected when in the story when he says ''I got down on my hands and knees, working the water handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substaNce oozed out followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. That affected him because, he was drinking a lot of water before he got to that point in his trip and he was almost out so he needed to fill up with more but he did not have a place to get more water. That is one of the features of the setting that affected him."	1	1		1																					
7469	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by getting dehydrated, getting tired, and by getting lost. After the cyclist was on the road for a while he had drank almost all of his water, but he still had a while to go before he got to his destination. He was going to try to find some where to stop so he could pick up more water but there was nothing around. He also got tired because he was out in the sun, had barley any water, and he didn’t know where he was going. One last example was that he was lost. There were no cars, buildings, or people. So if he were to get hurt or sick no one would have been able to help him.

7475	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting affect the cyclist alot. The terrain has a great deal to do with it. Also, the heat: First, the terrain affects the cyclist. It affects the cyclist because there is alot of hills. The text says, ""With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.” In order to go down a hill, you had to have gone up a hill. So, having to use the energy to pedal up hills affected the cyclist alot. Next, the heat affected the cyclist. I know this because the text says “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” This proves it is extremely hot outside. Heat would affect the cyclist because heat prevents you from functioning at your greatest ability. That is how the features of the setting in ‘Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist.

7476	3	"In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed posted speed limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way it affected him is the towns were old and deserted. In the story he said “This place might have been a thriving little spot… but @CAPS1 it was a ghost town.” He could not get any water or any directions. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because the roads were bumby and there were many hills. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS1 the cyclist had to use all his power to manuever over the hills. The third reason why the setting affected the cyclist was the weather and that it was a desert. “I was traveling through the deserts of California in June.” He was hot, sweaty and thirsty. He was also tired and desperate to find water and town that was not deserted. The features of the setting affected the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by the roads, deserted towns and the lack of water."	2	2		2

At first, Kurmaskie is confident as he listens to a group of old codgers giving him advice. The setting is calm and happy and Kurmaskie writes that he “enjoyed the serenity of an eary-summer evening”. The word “serenity” gives the affect of calm and peace. However, as Kurmaskie proceeds into his journey, the setting changes. He is troubled by the “ramshackle shed, several rutsy pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule” in a ghost town that he meets in the desert. Even later, the terrain changes and he sees a sign stating “Rough Road Ahead”. Kurmaskie’s confidence turns into even deeper doubt and worry as his water supply runs low. Finally, kurmaskie sees a sign for a fish camp. Here, his hope returns as he finds a “rather modern bathroom” where he can stop to get a drink. As the setting changes, Kurmaskie’s confidence is followed by determination and then relief."	3	3		3

7515	3	"The cyclist “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was definatly affected by the setting. He was cycling in California - which is a hot place to begin with - in June - which made it even hotter coming upon a hot desert. When you’re doing a physical activity like that, the last thing you want is to be in the heat. The narrator only brought one bottle of water which at first he was drinking regularly. Then it started to get hot and he was out of water. This affected his body by making him tired, and his mind because he started doubting himself. Then there was the abandon juice building where they made juice. He said “In an ironic twist abandon years earlier had been a Welch’s grape juice factory and bottling plant.” He was dying of thirst and then he found the bottling plant. The cyclist was definatly affected by his surrondings both mental - by saying “I’m going to die.” - and physically by becoming dehydrated."	2	2		2																					
7521	3	"The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For one, he was biking through the high deserts of California in June. This caused the cyclist to become overheated ad sweaty. So he drank from his water bottles frequently. Unfortunately, since there was, “no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” he had nowhere to fill his bottles and become dehydrated. To make matters worse, the terrain changed from flat road to “short, rolling hills”. Normally, this would not cause too much struggle, but since he was dehydrated and overheated, each hill seemed “crippling”, My thoughts are that if the setting had been a bit cooler and perhaps on the time period the old men had lived in, the cyclist would have had a much more enjoyable experience."	2	3		3

Even though the author started this journey out nice it did not take long for thing to change against him.

You could tell he says “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get excited.” He was very doubtful he’d get to where he was going.

Also, there is no buildings, people, or cars in sight to save him.

Another example is when it says “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” The connection with seeing a tumbleweed is that of being deserted and alone so this increased his feelings of despair. Lastly, he sees the Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, which is deserted and serves to only make him thirstier. All of these things affect the cyclist.

I’m sure that the heat makes the cyclist more thirsty, and heat can also drain energy extremely fast. Being in “the california desert in the middle of June” does not sound like an enjoyable time to be riding a bike. When the cyclist got tired and exhausted from not having any water, I’m sure that riding past all of the empty land had an effect on his attitude. I think that seeing a building made him get excited, and then when he found out that it was nothing more than an abandoned building, his spirits greatly dropped. He probably felt that he couldn’t continue for very much longer simply because all of the buildings he came across were empty, or abandoned. When the cyclist reached the bait store, he probably felt much better, and very relieved to have gotten there before he had a heat stroke."	3	2		3																					
7578	3	"According to the essay features of the setting affect the cyclist. If the cyclist is in the middle of a hot desert in June with no water, the cyclist will become excessively thirsty the longer they go. For example; the author states “I had been hitting my bottles pritty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June”. The terrain changes to short, rolling hills from flat land causing the cyclist to push herself to get the next town to get water. For instance; she states “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view”. This cause the cyclist to use what they thought of as their last burst of energy to get down there, but the building was abandoned, thus making the cyclist feel let down. As the cyclist continued on a setting of a bait store came and the cyclist felt relief because now she could get water. These examples show the change of setting on the cyclist’s trip and how it affected her."	3	3		3																					
7589	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One feature of the setting was the heat. It affected him by getting him dehydrated. For example the text states,“The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips I could drop from a heatstroke ” This meant the heat was getting to him."	1	1		1																					
7590	3	"The author made the setting seem long and unbearable, felt of undesirable heat and lack of water at hand. Specially in the way he kept describing the road with all these challenges that kept appearing like after @NUM1 miles to a town then @NUM2 miles passed that he, “came to a park of ???. One ramshackly shed, several rusty pumps and  a carrol that couldn’t hold in the hamest mule greeted me.This sight was troubling.” Then he went in a discharge, ""I was traveling strenght the high deserts of California in June. @CAPS1 ?? imagine, the heat, and unbareabalnes of the ??? journey still I face. @CAPS1 that bike seen endless.Then with a thrust gaining on him for example, ""I was doing a water-deplety 12 mph, sanctures life can seen be cruel. ""@CAPS1 him feel his constrain regrate on the journey @CAPS1 me feel his constrain sorrow for his endless journey he had to go through. Another example is, ""I riped the sweat from my eyes to make sure I wasn't a mirage"". Then, reaching this, the building abondoned years ago. @CAPS1 his journey seen hopeless and long had that make endless with first wave problems getting strength at him @CAPS1 his journey seen to be harder and filled with ?? hope as strenght left to finish his goals."	3	3		3																					
7593	3	"IIn the story I read the setting is a big factor to the affect of the cyclist for example it talks about how the cyclist see’s the sign that says, “Rough road ahead! Do not exceed posted speed limit.” So the cyclist has to be cautious"	1	1		1																					
7595	3	I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he talks about things that he had to endure while he was riding. For example he had no water so he was parched. There was a huge snake that took up half of the road and there wasn’t a building in sight. So the setting affected him with doubt but he had confidence of getting where he needed to get then when he got there it was a sign of relif. Thats how the setting affected was.	1	2		2																					
7603	3	"The settings effected the cyclist, because where ever he went it seem to never end. Like when he was riding along where the old men told him to go. He went through a ghost town like they said he would go through a town. Then he kept on going but it never end and the summer heat started to get to him. Like when he started to dehidade he this old juice factor and started imagening that he was drinking juice. So he started seeing things."	1	1		1																					
7610	3	"The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting. The cyclists has been pedaling his bike in the direction that the old men told him to go to get to Yosemite. Soon he is out of water and very tired and he believes he will die soon. But then he finds a fish camp, goes in the bathroom to revive himself. when he comes out a man is sittiNg on the porch. The author gets directios from him and is happy that he is on the right track again."	1	2		2																					
7615	3	"The features of the setting effected the cyclist in many ways. The setting was verry hot and there were a lot of hills. The cyclist had been riding up and down hills all day and it took a lot of energy when he saw the building that he thought could help him he said, “... last burst of energy, i mane'uvered down the hill,” By saying that it showed that the setting of where he was contained a lot of hillsy and they effected him by taking up all his energy. That is how the setting had effected the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
7619	3	"The features of the setting dramatically affected the cyclist. He started out in a confident mood, until he arrived at a town that was deserted. His confidence was still pretty high but not like it was prior to coming upon the ghost town. Twenty miles up the road after that, he came to a fork in the road which contained a ramshackle shed rusty, unclean pumps, and a small corral. The desert was hot and his lack of water was dehydrating him. Paragraph @NUM1 states, “This sight was troubling…I had been hitting my water bottles regularly, and was traveling through the high deserts in California.” With little water and a short energy supply he was getting tired and dehydrated quickly. The land started turning into rolling hills and caused him to become even more exhausted. His mood had gone from confident to hopeless. He even planned on changing a diary entry in case he died of heatstroke. The features obviously greatly affected the mood of the cyclist. Sometimes disappointment can come from taking the so-called “easy way out.” "	1	1		1																					
7623	3	"Many things can affect a cyclist. But in the story three main features of the setting affected the cyclist the most. While the cyclist was riding it was very hot. We know this by looking back at the text. It gives us this quote, “That I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” Because it was hot. This could make the cyclist thirsty. Another feature of the setting was the multitude of hills. This would create exhaustion. We know their were many hills because in the text it says.” Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” Going over all those hills can really tire someone out. A third feature of te setting would be nature. Nature can affect us in many ways, by weather, by terrain, as in this case by animals. In the story the cyclist comes upon a large snake. This making it dangerous. The setting can affect anything. It would have been a totally different story if the cyclist had been in the summer during @DATE1, not June."	3	3		3																					
7628	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it harder for him to pedal and complete his ride. For example, “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This should make his trip harder because instead of being able to pedal at one consistent rate the whole time, he would have to start pedaling harder and easier over and over again, using more energy. Another example is, “through the high deserts of California in June.” This makes it harder for him because he has to do all his work in a scorching summer heat. Finally, the first three stops he made had no where to fill his water bottles, take a drink, or cool off. This would make it hard because he is becoming dehydrated during his whole trip. These are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist by making his trip harder."	2	2		2																					
7642	3	"The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” has a great effect on the main character in the story. In the beginning of the story, he passes the first ‘town’ and continues riding his bike, following the directions some old folks gave him. “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.” His mood at this point was already confident, but this adds to it, with words like “rushing” being encouraging to him. Then, he continues moving on the road. “Not two miles into this section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.” At this point, he is becoming unsure of how good the directions he obtained really were. Once he is already tired, rolling hills isn’t what he wanted to find, so this adds to his doubt. Further along, he said, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. “This adds to the despair he was feeling, because he feels he is going to die in Yosemite. Not seeing anyone was probably extremely discouraging, so the setting really affected him. Then he said “over the long crippling hill, a building came into view.” It is at this point that he uses the word “crippling” because he is just about exhausted and can’t go any further."	2	2		2																					
7646	3	The setting in the passage is working against the cycler. Hes running low on water hes almost dehydrated and the weather were hes at is very very hot and he cant see a town for miles.	1	1		1																					
7647	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist because it was really hot out, he had very little amount of water, and a long way to go. The temperature was so hot, the cyclist said he felt dehydrated. He also had to go over a lot of hills and go through deserts to get where he needed to go. He took a “shortcut” but it ended up taking longer and he got dehydrated. This is how the setting affected him."	2	2		2																					
7649	3	"In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie many obstacles are caused from the diffrent settings. For example, the hot temperature caused the character to get dehydrated. He recalled “ I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ” This caused the loss of determination, which led to him lossing his consciousness. The hills he had to cycle also effected him. They caused him to become tired and weak and to lose his determination, as well. Just like the temperature problem, the loss of determination could eventually  make him lose consciousness. He said “ if it looked like i was going to lose consciousness for the last time.”  "	2	1		2																					
7650	3	"The setting of the story had effected the cycle’s becuse if it was sub earbs he could have stoped any where and got water but the plot was in a middle of a desert and all he could do is keep rolling and hoping to find some water For example, he had to go @NUM1 miles to get to the next town to get water and if he was not in the desert with hills he could have made that in no time at all    "	1	1		1																					
7652	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is to hot. It is hot enough that his water tasts like battery acid.  Then he has to deal with difficult trails breakway he said “old-timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” This is sayin that the old-timers gave him old directions. Plus what made the setting even hotter was he has been cycling nonstop. Then when he was riding he said “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.” With him thinking about this it made him forget about the heat. This was why the setting was affecting the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
7653	3	"There are many reasons as to why the features of the setting affects the cyclist. One reason is because it is so hot, I know this because it was sammertime in the California desert. Another reason is because the road was very rough. I know this because of the sign that he saw that said “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @NUM1). This tells you that the road is very rough. And being that he is on a bike rough roads are not very good for him. Another reason as to why the setting affects the cyclist is that there is no one to get directions from. There is no one around to give him a drink of water. These are few of the many reasons why the setting affects the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
7654	3	"The setting of this story is outside. Yosemite is outside riding her bike. She is around hills, no water, and very hot land. You know that she is around hills because she says to herself, “… I maneuvered down the hill.” You also know that she starts of around no??? ???good water. “When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid…” that shows the water was bad. Also the land is very hot because it says “…in the??? ???of two hundred degrees.” Yosemite starts off bad then ends up learning to stick to it and never give up. Yosemite’s biggest problem is her lack of water due to the fact that it is hot outside and the water she had was bad, tasting like battery acid. "	1	1		1																					
7657	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, the river and the pine trees “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them"". Thinking about that helped the cyclist keep going. Second, the road was getting harder to travel. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" and a sign on another road said “rough road ahead” The roads made the cyclist work harder to get to Yosemite National Park. Finally, the cyclist's water supply was running low. “the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing  sips.” Not having a lot of water is really bad when your outside in the heat and the cyclist had no idea where to find more. The towns the cyclist ran into were abandon or “ghost town”. The cyclist had nowhere to go to get help. This cyclist faced many problems during his bike ride to Yosemite national park."	2	3		3																					
7660	3	"The features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heat because he was getting lost and he was slowly running out of water. The cyclist said, “That you should never accept travel advice from old timers that haven’t left their porches since Carter was in office”. This means that because the cyclist followed their advice he got lost in the desert and was running very low on water. He was thirsty that he put stones in his mouth to keep him from thinking about water. In the end the cyclist learned to trust the map and the signs instead of listening to really old people who haven’t left their homes in years."	2	2		2																					
7668	3	"Different features of the settings affect the cyclist. The setting of the story, which is based in the desert has a negative affect on the character. “The desert land is baron, leaving him only with his small supply of water. During his journey he runs out of water causing him to lose contact with reality. The extreme heat in the desert causes him to begin to hallucinate. The cyclist begins to see a grape juice factory, which interrupts his trip. To his dismay, it turns out to be a no more than a mirage. The lengthy road also affected the trip. The length and roughness of the road had worn the cyclist down."	1	1		1																					
7674	3	When riding a bike the features around you can affect the cyclist. Some things that can affect the cyclist are weather and scenery. If the weather is cold and rainy the cyclist would not want to be riding. The dangers of riding when the weather conditions are bad will make the cyclist second guest: riding or not. If the weather is extremely hot the cyclist will get dehydrated quicker and even more exhasted. The scenery can also affect the cyclist. When a cyclist is riding and all he/she sees is a desert then they might have doubts on where there going. If there are abandon buildings everywhere the cyclist @MONTH1 become frighten and want to head back of lose hope as shown in the story “Do not exceed the speed limit” when he gets over a hill and begins to think that he will never make it to Yosemite. Many things can affect the cyclist.	1	2		2																					
7682	3	"There are many features of the setting that affected the cyclist in ""Do not exceed the posted speed limit,"" The time of year affected the cyclist because it’s mid June, @CAPS1 the region affected the cyclist because mid June in arizona is extremely hot and try. If it was in a more northern state in @DATE1 or I, ll it wouldn’t be as bad and you world not have the dance of a heat struggles. @CAPS1 when the terrain changed from flat to hills this affected him because it made it harder for him the to ride. These are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist in ""Do not exceed the posted speed limit."""	1	1		1																					
7684	3	"In the essay, “Rough Road A head Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First of all, he was traveling in the @CAPS1 which means it was very dry. This meant that the cyclist could not refill his water and was slowly getting dehydrated. Also, the cyclist was biking in the heat. This meant that he was continuesly sweating which also depleted his water from his body and played tricks on his mind. Finally the hills caused him to exact more energy furthermore making him more and more dehydrated. The hills also put a damper on his spirits, which made him have to muster a lot of inner strength and determination to keep going. This part of the setting affected him emotionally. Overall the setting had a physical and emotion effect on him."	2	3		3																					
7698	3	"The setting of the story, are very dry and humid, and flat, and hilly. The author noticed the terrain changing, “Flat road. Was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Joe kurmaskie). Being out in the middle of a dessert like surronding during June, and nothing surronding him is a scary thought. The heat, and lack of water affect him, by him possibly getting mirages, or he @MONTH1 faint, because of the heat, and how much fluid he has lost. The hills don’t help any eigther."	2	1		2																					
7704	3	"In the story, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, the condition of the road was bad. It changed from flat road to short, rolling roads. Tumble weeds crossed his path. He had lack of water, and the water he did have tasted like battery acid. In the story it says, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.”  "	2	2		2																					
7707	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist; the author says he is in the California desert. This means that the cyclist must conserve water so he can stay hydrated for the trip. Also, there are many hills, as the author says, “over one crippling hills…” with a lot of hills to climb, the cyclist uses up more energy and will become dehydrated quickly, if he isn’t careful. Finally, there are many abandoned towns that are several miles apart from each other. This again affects how the cyclists uses his water, he thinks that there is a prospering town coming up, so he drinks his water, thinking he’ll get more soon. However, when he gets there, there is no water, and he must pedal seveal more miles to the next town with very little water. The setting is a great effect on how the cyclists act especially with no water."	2	2		2																					
7708	3	"The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” greatly affect the cyclist. Depending on what sort of new terrain or landmark he came to,his determination increases and decreases. For example, when he saw a building come into view ahead of him, he got excited and used all his energy to get down the hill to the building. Also, when he came to the next building and found a working bathroom, he drank from the sink as his hope (of not dying) was renewed. The man riding the bike in the story had many different changes in his emotions during his long trek in this story that were dependent on the setting. "	2	3		3																					
2993	2	"Dear Newspaper,     @CAPS1 would you feel if someone wrote a book about @CAPS1 bad the newspapers are, and the tore you down so bad no one wanted to touch another newspaper? Think about it if something is found offensive should it be avalible for thousdands and thousands of other people to read? I believe that certain materials such as books, music,movies,ect. that are found offensive should not be allowed to be removed from a libraries book shelves, let alone even be on the shelves.     Now lets just think about this for a moment.What if a sexist book fell into the hands of an inocent childs hands that could just read enough to get through the book? That child could end up living that kind of life that the book protays. If I were a parentt I know for a fact I would never want my children exposed to harmful reading materials until they know right from wrong, and have a clear judgement on it.     Or from another perspective what if that  one book, about @CAPS1 black people are bad and nasty, fell into the wrong hands for this purpose lets say a drunken, old fashioned man. Who just so happens to think we should continue slavery. That one book could stimulate this white mans thoughts and he could try to put his thoughts into action. Throwing what that book says about black people in a young black womans face. Then continues ,after seeing what that alone has done to her, rapes and beats her. Only to let her live and make her his own whore or slave for aslong as shes living. Can you imagan this world when @CAPS2 only knows @CAPS1 bad this woman is hurting. @CAPS2 is the only one who know @CAPS1 long she will deal with the pain.Before she stops fighting for her life.     Just think all that I have told you about, gave you examples of all started with that one single book.The offensive book towards sexists and towards black people. these are all reasons for those book to be ban from libraries or at least glued to the shelves."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
2998	2	"Dear news people,     I am qriting to you because I have my own answer on what people should do with books. I think it is ok for people to write whatever thay want because it's a free contruy to where you can do anything that you tink you can do. What I am trying to say is that people can write books how ever thay want with anything in it such as drugs, sex, abuse, bad language, and so on you get what I'm saying. I think it's ok to write whatever they want and put whatever it was they wrote about on the shelf. It's they person who is picking a book choose to read a book just because they don't like what the book was about they don't have to make a big deal about it and cause a problem. People can just not pick the book up and look for another book.     I don't think it's fear that people should make a big deal out of a book that they don't have to read at all it makes no since to me and I bet a lot of people would agree. If I was someone who was a aganised stuff like sex, and drugs and I saw it in a book I would just set it down and look for a book that I would agree with than causing a problem like others would. It just is not fare and it's a waist of time to me if someone has to complane about something so dumb.     So to rap this thing up I think people who don't like the way books are writen should just put it down and not worry about it and buy a book that they feel better off with reading. There is no point to waist time and cause a problem that's my oppion about this problem hope it is yours to."	3	2		3	2	2	2																		
2999	2	"I think that books, magazines, papers etc shouldn't be removed from the librarys because some @CAPS1 like to @CAPS2 them. Some @CAPS1 feel that reading a book about there problem will help them get through what ever problem they are having. @CAPS1 often say that they are stressed and depressed. Those @CAPS1 can get the books and @CAPS2 them to help them solve there problems.     If the books etc are offensive then, the @CAPS1 who think they are shouldn't get them. The can't control what books are in the library. Some @CAPS1 have problems and some of the books can help them. Alot of @CAPS1 I know dont think that alot of books are offensive. Its eather they want to @CAPS2 them or they dont.      If @CAPS1 think that books etc are offensive they will just have to deal with it. @CAPS1 like to @CAPS2 all kinds of books and some dont even like to @CAPS2. For the @CAPS1 who like to @CAPS2 they can pick whatever book they want that they feel confortable with. If they think that a book is offensive they go past it and find a different book to @CAPS2.      I suppose if you find a offensive book you could go to the teacher or someone and talk about it. Im sure that they wont do anything about it. The books and other things are there for a reason, 'For @CAPS1 To @CAPS2', and to understand what there life is and how to fix it.      You have to control under the books. You can't tell them what books should be one the shelf and what cant be on the shelf. In conclusion I think that @CAPS1 should deal with it because they cant control it"	3	3		3	3	2	3																		
3002	2	"I think almost every movie might offend someone in some way, So if your wanting to take every movie off the shelf then go ahead. Everyone has different taste in movies, music, books, etc. If the music offends you, don't listen to @CAPS2. If a book does, don't read @CAPS2. Its as simple as that. So I don't think they should remove the books, music, movies, etc. That could offend someone, and here are my reason why;          If you were to remove all the things that might interest the people now a-day, then you wouldn't have anything that entertains the kids instead of them going out and getting in trouble, I believe every person has the right to read, watch, or listen to whatever @CAPS2 is they want to listen to. Also If they find @CAPS2 offensive then they just shouldn't listen that song, watch that movie, or even read the book or magazines. Everyones offended in different ways from another, So we can't help @CAPS2 if @CAPS3 little book, song, etc., offends a person.          I also think if you give a kid the chance to read @CAPS2, and he sees how offensive @CAPS2 might be, @CAPS2 might keep him/her from doing some of the things he might do if he didn't read the book, Also if he watches what movies he wants, he will learn that, @CAPS1 every body is good people. Children read in a wide variety, some read there dr.suess books and other could be reading @PERSON1 '@CAPS2'. Depending on the children they should be able to choose what they read, listen to or watch. The only flaw I find about Children down side to some magazines is the fact almost every magazine has atleast @CAPS3 half naked women, or man in @CAPS2. Children in there @ORGANIZATION1 years through about first year of @ORGANIZATION2 should @CAPS1 have to see that.          My @CAPS4 reason is, people have many different tastes in the materials, so I believe they can read what they want as long as @CAPS2 does @CAPS1 offend them. What there reading should @CAPS1 have any effect on others unless they are reading @CAPS2 also. There are so many people that get offended by the littlest things, but they don't see that its life they will get offended more than a hand full of times in there life.           In conflusion I think that people should be able to read what they want even the books people find offensive. The offensive things Should @CAPS1 be taken off the shelves. I also feel that if children get to read some things that could be offensive then they will understand the fact that life isn't easy and you will end up being offended. Also that @CAPS1 everyone is good people, and things happen that people don't like but its life. Finally I think people should @CAPS1 have to give up reading, listening to, watching or looking at things that @MONTH1 be interesting to them"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3003	2	"The world in full of offensive material, and there almost nothing we can do for it. These books that we leave behind influence the future of our society. These materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries because it is part of a large varity knowledge and the library is not the last place someone will look for such material.      On the logical side of this, the more a person knows the more power one has. That doesn't mean that some items such as centain types of music of movies are inapropate his or her age. Some partents get really  offensive when they see something slightly inapropate but the thing to remember is that, those so called little children will sooner or later see such items; it is just a part of growing up.      In the last paragraph, it suggested that a person should have large mass of imformation to choose from becasue there is not a perfect little soul and everyone has amounts of cruiosity. For example somethings like @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 are taught in school and could be consided dangerous. In @ORGANIZATION1 we learn the ways of atoms and  make make perdictions of how they will react with other chemicals. When in the lab, students are required to wear safety material because of the dangerous enviroment. The same goes for @CAPS1, one learns about how to live a healthy life and this requires students to learn about the human body such as the reproductive systems. In these @CAPS3 we learn better how the world works around us and with this we learn things that can be dangerous.     With everything that we do there is postive and negative outcomes. What I am suggesting is that, we need to find a healthy balance of what is really needed and the materials that are strickly entertainment, and those items should be removed. If it has some purpose behind it, then it holds a place but if it is some magazine talking about drama it apears very useless.      In this large world there alway was and always will be people or material that are a bad influnce. Yet this is all a matter of perception and everyone has different torances and values. With this on going problem, we shall make this judgment with the best of our ablities, based off of our values"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3021	2	"In this millenium we really should'nt be to concerned about censorhip. People say so way worse in puplic and do worse things in public. On the other side of this, the parents of a child should be watching their kid and looking to see what they are about to grab off the shelf. Its the parents fault if their child gets ahold of a book that has adult content on or in it. So why should we have censorship?                                                                             If a cd contains adult content and the child is underage and grabs it off the shelf listening to it, then its the parents fault for not being responsible enough to watch their child. Same goes for books and etc.. Now if the child is old enough to understand what they grab then they should be able to listen to it, and ask questions about it. If its about adult relationships and the child takes it, then the parent should explain it all and tell them what is going on. The parent should be the one to take responsibility.                           Now, if a book, music, movie, magazine, and ect.contain raceism in it then it should be censored, unless its about history. Kids under the age of teen usally repeat what they hear or read. Same goes for teenagers too actualy! Books with the wrong kind of words in it should be kept safe or there should be a age to where you can get it. The world has enough horrid language in it, why should the library add to it by letting kids get ahold of these books and repeating what they hear.                  I remember when I was walking around a library and I saw a little kid not older than @NUM1 grab an adult book and started to open it and look through it. The parent was no where to be seen nor heard, who leaves their child in a book section like that? This young boy put the book down on the hard floor and started to take off his clothes. This was no ones fault, wasnt the library, wasnt mine. People should take responsibility, control their kids and if they can't then leave them at home!                                                        There are also certain people who need book for research and need to take home books for their projects. We should'nt have censorship and take down all the books that should be contained from kids. Some of us need those kind of books in order for us to do our research and projects!      No we should'nt have censorship in our libraries! Im not about to be able to miss a project or miss a good movie because some parents don't know how to control their kids and watch what they grab. We should be able to keep all the books, movies, magazines, and ect., there could be a way to censor most books but they would need their own shelf, and they could be a age lemit or a pass people could use. That would take to long to do so though. So keep our libraries filled with interesting things without censoring them!"	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
3022	2	"Libraries, to myself, are a gateway to another world; where I can be who I want to be, and let my imagination wander where ever it pleases. Libraries should not have the ability to take a book off the shelves depending on it's content. We are all different people, we all don't enjoy the same kind of books. Also, some books @MONTH1 be needed for research. Censorship in a library should not be allowed.     First, there are so many different people in the world. Some people learn more about people from books. Imagine yourself a white, @NUM1 year old boy, growing up in an all white town. Never in your life have you seen an @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You go to the library and pick up 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS4 young boy has never been introduced to such racism. Books are history. Books are learning. Books can not be taken off the shelf just for their content. That content might be a whole other world for a young child.      Next, libraries are used so often by college students to writer papers for school. Books are needed for research. For an example, you're a college student writing a research paper on abuse--including sexual, physical, and mental. A young author writes a non-fiction novel about her childhood ranging from being raped by her father at six years old to being bullied in school. After hours of searching, you find all local libraries have removed @CAPS4 book for it's explicit content. College students need books no matter what they're about.     Libraries are open to people of all age. It is understandable that a twelve year old could easily get a hold of a book inappropriate for their age level, but that's why libraries are split into sections. If you find a book that is considered to be taken off the shelves, don't remove it, just move it to a more secure and mature area"	4	3		4	4	4	4																		
3033	2	"Why should we be more carefull of what we get at the libary? Libaries can have books with knowledge, fun, rommance, and action or adventure, but some can be desterbing and grusium. Kids a lot of times will pick books that have pornagerfy or grusium action. This causes the kids to act in different ways. They act hyper and mean to other people or even other children. They are sneeky and do things behind the parents back. Why is because they think they need to act this way because its cool, but they don't understand this makes them look very ugly. 'So take them out' is some of the parents are saying now a days.     Even if we do take out all the books that can be bad for our children, there will not be a lot of books left. Because now a days all books have something that is bad for our mind. So why do we need to be more carefull with the books we put in our libary and the books we take out of our libary? It causes the world to change very fast.     Now libarys are a great place for kids to learn. Books can teach them new things and expand their knowledge. The libary is where all kids that have reports or essays on important people come to. Some kids go there just to get a book to enjoy. From my point of view libary is one of my most favorites places to be. Any where there are books involved count me there. Having books causes our imagination to come out and take us on adventeres that some of us will never get to do.     Sometimes books can cause things to happen in families. Some of them causes us to have nightmares or have very bad behavior. If we try to take out some of these books it will help the familes to come together, but also if we don't take out some of the books, it will cause things to go wild. Because people and kids think they need these books to survive in the world. Which really its just  the books and ect... that causes our mind to picture things that make us think we need them.      Other writing materials and even movies cause problems in this world today. Magazines can have girls with not much clothes on or other things that make boys minds wander. Movies are even worse because the picture is right there in front of their faces. I am not saying all magazines and movies are bad to our mind because they can also be helpful. Magazines can help us with research or just to now what is happening in this world today.      They also can talk on many subjects like cooking, room decerating, on how to decerate your weddings and etc... Movies can help us research and also show us what happened back then. Like watching docromentries, they are on people or what happened in our past. We don't need to take every movie or magazine out, but some we can do without.      So why do we need to be more carefull for what we put in libaries? It can cause us to have bad behavior or bad dreams. So how can we help to solve this problem? We can take out  books, magazines, movies and etc... that are really bad for our mind. So it can help our children to grow up well behavied and mature. Also one more thing books, magazines, and movies can be a very good thing if we use it right. How do we know we got a good book? We find right books for us by following our heart and our instinkes"	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
3041	2	"There are many books that are offensive to people. I personally agree. There are many things that shouldn't be seen by children.There is alot of material out there, weather its books, movie, and other things that have a bad influences on children. Children learn by watching and observing. They learn from us and our generation. What better way to protect them than by removing their bad influences.     First, children watch movies and they see to people kissing and one thing leads to another. Some movies even show people having sex. What kind of influence is that on the children. Than the children learn and they go out there and do the same thing. Teen pregnacies have jumped threw the roof. High @CAPS1 are filled with pregnant teens. Any where you go I garentee you will see a pragnant teen. Some girls even get pragnant right after they have developed and were able to have kids. Now imagine if we were able to stop that. Theres a way; dont let the children watch these programs, that way they won't be tempted.     Secondly, there are books and movies and other things that show the children shooting and killings and how people get away with it. This could be a very bad influence. There are video games with shootings and have limbs flying all over the place. Well the children will learn from those video games and movies. They think that killing someone is ok and you can get away with it. Bad influences like that make the children think it's ok to do things like that.There have been children who have killed their parents for a video game. Then the children become cereal killers or go on a shooting spry at school. Is that not much evidence at all to show the people that something is wrong. We need to take imediate control of this situation and stop it before one day you see your child on television for killing someone.        Finally, all the children are getting lazier. All children do is lay down and watch tv or play video games. Their lazyness causes obesity. Their are many kids to whom this topic refers to. No parent wants to see their kid over weight for many reasons. Children being obeast causes lots of depression. The child feels sad because they feel ugly and they lose self esteem. Thechild then becomes shy and quiet. In some cases the child trys to comit suicide because otherchildren are teasing them in school everyday. I know any parent wouldn't want their kid to die. These are things that are happening and parents need to open their eyes and see whats happening before its to late.      In conclusion, to prevent all these catastrophies their has to be change. Their are many harmful and bad influences out their today that can determine the childrens futures. There still time for change, so lets do something about it. Lets try to reduce teen pregnancies, bad influencial video games or movies, and instead of watching movies and playing video games all day get up go outside and go for a walk. These are little things we can do to make a change for good"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3055	2	"If you were offinded by a book in the library would you want it took off the shelf? I wouldn't there is no point in removing it there are a lot of books that offend people, that one book isn't just towards you the same goes for movies and music.      Books should be able to be written about any and everything that interests people. Some people @MONTH1 not find the same thing offending like you do everyone dont think alike. If books were made towards emotions or about how people would look at them then there wouldn't be that many books in the world today. This is a free country and we have the write to speak and write about whatever we want to get out.          Movies are anoter way of getting you emotions or expressing yourself. People find most movies offending but neither are movies made up of how people feel about it. We are able the express any and everything we can in whatever it is that we do in movies. No one or no race is the center of attetion in movies people @MONTH1 feel as if they are but thats a personal thing people @MONTH1 go through.     Music can be produced or even rapped or sung in many different ways to get to people. Music @MONTH1 be found most offending now days but, music is also away of getting emotions and freedom of speech out. I've never felt offended because of a song i've heard or anything people are going to say what they feel and want.     Freedom of speech goes a long way in the world people either gotta het used to it or stay offended. Books,music,movies, or magazines wont be pulled because of emotions. I look at it as a way of art expression that shows how people think and respond to things"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3057	2	"I do not think that they should be taken off of the shelf because some people find it offensive. The way i look at it is, is that everyone has their own beliefs and rights their own opinions. Not everyone is going to think alike.     As an example some people are against blacks and others are not. Everyone thinks different and have their own opinions therefore, they should all be able to listen to whatever.      Not everyone is going to like what you like and listen and believe everything you do. Don't read it if it offends you, but just cause it offends you doens't mean that someone else out there doesn't believe in it or likes it."	3	2		3	3	2	3																		
3064	2	"I actually do believe that they should be able to be removed from the shelf. On the other hand i do not believe that anything rascist should be on library shelfs. Teens these days want to be able to pick up a book that they can actually relate to and the same thing goes for a movie, nusic, and a magazine.      You can't help what people want to listen to or like to read or watch. I don't really like robot movie's or any of that crap so that wouldn't be something i'd pick out to watch. On the other hand i don't think that it should have to be removed out of the library just because i dont like it. Also something like @CAPS1 in the @LOCATION1, i don't think that it should be removed from shelve's just because of the title. Family @CAPS2 is a really funny show but also has a lot of bad language in it but i don't think it should be removed because thats what people like to watch. Teens want to be able to read about they can relate to, but some of the things in the book can be offensive maybe. If they didn't have anything to read that they could relate to hardly anyone would read. Not everyone listens to the same music but a @NUM1 yr old doesn't want to go around listening to barney, they want to listen to the music that they like and think is cool, but on the other hand others @MONTH1 not like it. Not letting you get something off of the library shelf because it's bad is like saying you can't eat a certain kind of food because its bad for you.     If people didn't get to listen to, read, or watch the things that they like they would be screwed and very upset. I think people are entitled to their own opinion, although some people's opinions could be rather stupid. Not everyone likes the same things and we shouldn't have to."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3074	2	"Several years ago a parent at my school complained to the administration about a book, The @PERSON2, her child was about to read for his english class. She believed that it was an inappropriate book for a ninth grader to read. She was in her rights to be a little nervous about the book, there had been concerns from within the school when it had been added to the ciriculum. The administration eventually decided to keep the book as part of the class because even though the approprietness of one scene @MONTH1 have been in question the rest of the book taught lessons taht were important to children, like tolerance for other cultures, the imaortance of right and wrong and that you must fix the things that you have done wrong.     Although I understand that parents do not want to expose their precious children to the rest of the world, I believe that it is important to be exposed to a wide variety of materials because it helps people learn about different cultures and other ways of life. I once read a quote that said something a long the lines of understatnding leads to tolerance. We cannot ban books and other media because we think they are inapproriate for a situation. Being able to understand another person's culture or point of view @MONTH1 one day lead to the solution of problems in out world today, such as the crisis in the @LOCATION1 involving the @CAPS1 and the @CAPS2.     I agree very much with the quote by Katherine Paterson about how if we all take away books and other media that we dislike we would have nothing left. A good example of this is the popular internet video site, @CAPS3. There are thousands of videos listed on this site and millions of people who watch them. On each video there is a place to leave feedback on whether you liked or dislike said video. With all of the different viewpoints, opinions, and interests of the millions of people who have viewed this site it is very difficult to find a video without at least one or two dislikes. If we all had the power to take videos we disliked off the site, there would be none left for us to watch.     Another reason why we cannot just remove offensive things from our shelves is that without authors taking a little rebellious flair and exposing new ideas, the material we read would quickly becme very boring. During the women's suffrage movment, the men of this country thought the idea of women being allowed to vote was offensive. Now after many years it is seen as a commonplace thing and it is now a legal right for women to vote.This is an example of how a once radical idea has now gained support and made people's lives better. If we take these books from our shelves we are harming ourselves and allowing us to become ignorant.     All books and media have value, whether they express just one person's ideas or the thoughts of thousands. We remove material from our shelves at a risk to ourselves as individuals and as a society as a whole. I believe that the founding fathers of our country knew what they were doing when they included the freeedom of speech in the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6. If we remove books and other media from the literal and figurative shelves of our society, are we not denying the authors, writers, singers, and publishers who made those works their freedom of speech?"	4	5		4	4	4	4																		
3078	2	"Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc ...,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?   Most of the people made books that are inapropiate or offensive and sometimes are the life of the person or some experience that they have live. But the problem is that a lot of people are not realistic and they don't thing that those is the live of person's and can be the future of more people.Peple sometimes like to be the best and can make problems with other and that mekes them happy that is a sad thing because that's bad and also they can get of the point of do things so bad that they go to jail that's are some of the experiences that people shows  but others get it wrong. well thats their problem they can do what ever they whant .  I know that live is not easy but thank's of that material we can have a better live and also we can deffence ourselves.  Also i don't think that they  need to be remove that books or magazines because that's what help us to have e better life and also in the future, they need to be in there and if people found them offensive just don't go there or don't see that materials ignore them more people like those and thinkthat are helpful for them and for me.   I don't think that they goin to have a bad material in there, things that are inapropiate i thing that they can't have bad or  nasty information in a place that a lot of people go and not only adult also childre's  go too. And that's is more inappropriatefor kids. People know what's going on in there and some others persons know too. the world sometimes is a danger and sometimes help us for grows up that's is a good thing but we hace the choise if we want to read or have that information.  I remember one time when i read a book that is kind of sad but that help me to know better our life it was about two boys the book has a lot of bad words and talk really bad bad olso that explain more the book and we learn more about it. that's some things that help us with life. One of the books, magazines,music,movies .etc  that we can write is our life because we pass a lot of difficults times and that is a book of our life and can be a inappropriate book of our live.people like me give the tanks to those peoples that publish they experiences and at the same time help us"	3	2		3	3	2	3

3101	2	"No, i do not think that books, magizines, movies and music should be removed. However, I do think that the books, magizines, movies, and music should be monitred by age. The reason why is because younger children sould not be reading , listening, or watching material that is for adults or teenagers.       They way these type of things can be monitred is by the child's library card. The card could have their name, age, grade, and date of birth. If there is a certain book, magizine, movie, and music that the child want a parent has to be there with them. The parent needs to show a form of identification so that the librian knows that the parent  is of age.           Teenagers should also be moniterd. Event though they are almost adults. Some parents @MONTH1 not agree with some of the material. So, if their parents does not want them reading certain things their should be stickers on their cards.

3107	2	"Two of the many privaleges that we have as @CAPS1 are freedom of speech and freedom of expression. Although some bodies of work @MONTH1 be percieved as offensive or inappropriate, I believe that they should still be available to the public. Some might agree with the topic being expressed, even if it is offensive or inappropriate, and others @MONTH1 not; but they should not be removed from libraries because of their negativity.     These offensive or harsh pieces of literature could even be used to show the public what is considered rude, offensive, or inappropriate, and should be thought of as learning tools instead of being banned. Every person has a right to an opinion, and others @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not agree with what that person has to say, but it does not change the fact that they have the right to their beliefs.     Katherine Paterson says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self'. I myself have read literature that is considered offensive, but as disturbing as the literature was, I am glad that I was educated on what people thought was acceptable behavior so that I know, and can teach others that despite what the book said, we now know that it was describing how people should not be living.     I believe that it would be a grave mistake to remove these materials from the public eye, because many are ingorant to the historical beliefs of others that have affected our nation and other countries across the globe. All of these books are educational, though some are harsh, and they should be used to show what is right and wrong. If they are taken off of shelves in the libraries then people, especially children could start to think that a certain idea, that @MONTH1 be incorrect or offensive, is completely appropriate and acceptable. As someone once said, '@CAPS2 who do not know their history are bound to repeat it'.     By removing the problem, we would be creating another issue. For example, many books have been written over history that convey hatred and discrimination towards other cultures, ethnicities, religions, and lifestyles. If @CAPS2 works of literature were banned and not available to the public, many people would not know that it is wrong to show hatred towards others just because they are different than you. This type of literature provides usefull information: it allows people to see how a large amount of people thought life should have been years ago, and they taught the people of @DATE1 that it actually was how people should not be living."	3	4		3	4	3	4																		
3108	2	"Libraries are known as places where a person can go to find material on almost any topic they could want to learn about, whether that material is a book, movie, or magazine. Anyone can use the library, and it is a valuable resource to many people. So why do some libraries insist on removing some of those valuable materials from their shelves?     In past years, censorship in libraries has been the focus of many news reports. In almost all cases, library patrons have been angry that certain materials have been deemed unsuitable to be offered at the library. I have to say that I agree with them. People have a right to choose what books they want to read, what movies they want to watch, and what music they want to listen to. People have opinions; people disagree. What one person loves, another person could hate. But just because one person dislikes or is offended by a material on a library shelf does not mean that the opportunity to use that material should be denied to all other patrons. I feel that if a resource is checked out by just one individual, and that one individual is able to learn from or enjoy the resource, then the library has achieved its purpose and helped the community by offering that material.      In conclusion, censorship in libraries is limiting and wrong. It creates barriers for those who want to learn and it takes away people's freedom to make decisions for themselves. Everyone should be able to decide whether to pick up a library material, and censorship makes that impossible"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3116	2	"I think that if there are books, music @CAPS1, movies, or magazines that we should have a right to take it off the shelf if its offensive. The reason why I think this is, because I have a baby girl who I don't want to see that kind of stuff. I don't want her listening or watching movies or reading anything offensive or vulgar.           I know this is a free country and everyone has the right to have their own opinions. The libraries are paid by tax payers dollars and if we take the offensive to vuglar movies, books, music and magazines then they should come off the shelf.  Kids can read or see or listen the these vulgar things an think its ok or cool to say or do these things.     They can see bad pictures, nudity, drugs and violence. They can see the different types of drugs and learn about them. For example pictures of weed, cocaine or pills are in books. The kids can look at this stuff and see violence. For example they can see pictures of  men hitting women or kids killing kids and this sets a bad example.     We live in a world where people are influenced by the things they read, watch, and listen to. It is important that people are aware of what their children are seeing. The library is a place where many people go to learn. It is important that only people are allowed to see material that is appropriate for them"	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
3119	2	"There are more than six billion people in the world. That means there are over six billion different personalities and opinons of all these distinct people. It would be virtually impossible to remove all aspects of media that could be found offensive, because almost everyone is offended by something. Some media can be found more offensive than others, but its likely that its something that the author feels passionate about and the author could be offended if his opinon was rejected. Now that the internet is accessible in almost all places in the world. Media that used to only be found on the shelves is now displayed online, which can never be permanently removed from public view. It's illogical to think that just removing materials from libraries would prevent different groups of people from being offended by the media.     There is a big difference between awareness and offensiveness. Some books and magazines might just have the intent to explain a type a culture and raise awareness about the subject. However, there is a definite line that reaches over to offensiveness that can easily be crossed by authors across the globe. So, it is in those authors best interest to take into account the people they are writing about. It's important to avoid stereotypes because those can be hurtful. There is already plenty of offensive literature in the world and to find it all and restrict all of it would just be irrational. If a person is offended by something someone wrote, they should just avoid reading it. However, this does not give authors the power to target a group in their writing and offend them specifically.      This is a very two-sided subject. It can not strictly be controlled by censoring libraries; it is also in the hands of authors and readers everywhere. Authors and media producers should take other people into consideration and put their efforts into raising awareness instead of offending. In regards to this, readers across the globe should keep in mind why the author might target them, and avoid conflict by avoiding the material. It is not right by any means to target and offend a group of people in a piece of literature; however, this is a practice that has been done before and just remvoing the materials from the shelves won't stop it from being exploited.      Libraries are already decreasing severly in their reveleance in the world. All the new technology has hurt them and its not likely that they will ever become more prominent than other reasources, like the internet, again.With this in mind, how much would censoring libraries really help those offended groups in the world? Most likely, they would not even notice a change. Everyone has the right to have an opinon and share it, but it is important to keep the feelings of others in mind as well. The world is overflowing with different media that many people have access to, so writers and producers need to think outside of themselves before putting it on the shelves."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3121	2	"I, personally, do not think that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the shelves because they are found offensive. However, I do believe that there should be a way to protect adolescent, still-developing children from reading books that @MONTH1 offend them or introduce them to new concepts or ideas that @MONTH1 hinder their educational growth. Some kids who have not been properly educated over a controvercial topic (such as drugs or alcohol) @MONTH1 make a bad decision based off something he or she reads about in a book or on a webpage.     To help solve the problem of offending children or deterring their education, I propose that we make a book 'rating' system. Similar to rating a movie or a video game, this system would rate the book so that readers know what age level the book is apropriate for, and state what factors the book incorporates to rate it the way they did.     As a newpaper company, you obviously know about our @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. We, as @CAPS3, have @CAPS2. One of them being freedom of speech, along with freedom of press. With that said, I do not think that taking books labeled as 'inappropriate' off the shelves is a reasonable solution to the issue. I know, that from personal experience, when someone tries to take away my @CAPS2 that I'm entitled to, I get extremely angry. Authors, editors, photographers, and publishers all go through a lot of hard work and long hours to put these books on the shelves. By taking the books off the shelves, I believe that that would be repressing their @CAPS2 as @CAPS3. I know that if I were an author, and my book were taken off the shelf, because someone found it 'inapppropriate' I would be very upset. Taking books off the shelves could possibly cause an author's strike, to protest until their books are allowed to be enjoyed by anyone who wishes to read them.      However, like I mentioned in the second paragraph, I do think that making a rating system for books is a good idea that allows the authors to express themselves fully, and also allows readers to know what controvercial material is in the book without them being affected by the information they would have read without the warning. I would strongly advise you consider my proposal, because it has the potential to prevent future confrontations between authors and the public."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3122	2	"Why @CAPS1 @CAPS2?     Is there movies, music, magazines, books, and more in our libraries today seen as offensive to some? A good portion of people believe so, and there is some that @CAPS2 doesn't even concern. So should they be removed from the shelves of our public libraries or should they be able to stay? Katherine Paterson made a statement and a part out of @CAPS2 said ' But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work that I abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     @CAPS3, I believe that some of the literature and magazines should be taken out of the libraries just because of the content many books are loaded with foul language, violence, sex appeal, ect. For example I can recall a day I went to a local library with my little sister, and she was looking for a disney magazine and there were provocative magazines on the shelf that had half naked women on the cover right next to the kids magazines. To me this is an image of selling sex. What parent would want there child learning about sex at a young age?      Next, even the music today placed in libraries is not good clean music. A lot of the music today is also sellling sex, violence, and drugs. My father tells me all the time till this very day that music back in the day was appropriate for all ages. Music such as hip hop, and rap, is the main source for all the inappropriate stuff, but the rappers and producers are not to blame causse they are only creatimg what people want and what is selling.     Also, the movies rented out of the libraries today are very offensive. They seem to contain the same material as the books, magazines, and music.They all portray the same image that seems to be entertaining to majority of the society today. So can we just find something better to catch the attention of the audience who buy this material?      In conclusion, I do believe that this material should be taken off the shelves of public libraries. But I dont think @CAPS2 would do any good, cause people will just find another source to get @CAPS2. Like Katherine said @CAPS2 won't be any books left if its all taken off"	4	3		4	3	3	3																		
3123	2	"I believe censorship should be used in libraries to a certain extent. There are too many children that have access to inappropriate materials at the library, but some of it could be useful.     There was a time when I borrowed a movie from the public library. When I went home to watch it with my mother, it turned out to be highly inappropriate and offensive, not to mention awkward and embarassing. My mom and I couldn't believe that a person of any age could have access to a movie as inappropriate as the movie '@CAPS1'.      Although there are some materials that should not be in the library, there are some materials that could be thought of by some people to be offensive that are in the library for educational purposes. Some people think gay rights, abortion, and teenage sexual activity are offensive. There @MONTH1 be some people that would like to know more about one of those things for a project at school or a problem in their personal lives. Somebody @MONTH1 have a family member who believes they are homosexual, a daughter who has become sexually active, or a woman @MONTH1 be thinking about recieving an abortion. What is offensive to some, @MONTH1 not be offensive to others.     I believe censorship should be used for some offensive materials. If it is educational, it @MONTH1 be useful to some people. There will never be a perfect answer for a problem like this in the world. As the world evolves, so does the human race's morals and there is nothing that is offensive to all the people in the world."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3127	2	"There are many books in the library that shouldn't be there. From books about racism, violence, or pornagraphy I wouldn't want my young children to be able to take those type of books out of the library.     A library in a school is a great way to help sudents with projects, essays, or just to read. If my child was in elementry or even middle school , I wouldn't at all want them to be able to check out a book about things they shouldn't even know about yet. If my teenager was in high school though, I wouldn't mind that because they are old enough to realize the things that actually go on in the world. They also could be doing a project over the wrongs of pornagraphy, in which the library is better place to find a book then the interent that could take them to many bad websites. Since I go to my local high school I think its nice to be able to find anything I need in my library at school. It makes it easier to work on projects.      Also in libraries there are a ton of music, movies, and magazines. If a library has educational music, why not keep them in there? If the music is rap, pop, or country they could just get it from @CAPS1 instead of the library providing it. Magazines can also be educational. If you are doing a project on fashion a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 would be excellent to help them find out some tips. Magazines can also have some inaproprate things in them. Since all they talk about in the media is sex, sex articles would probably be in the magazines. Whenever I look in magazines I just skip all of that nonsense they talk about and read the articles about clothes, food, and people. Exposing that to young children wouldn't be the best, but for teenagers they understand. Movies shouldn't be in the library unless they are educational too. There are a ton of @CAPS4 around that those scary movies don't need to be in a library.     In conclusion I think it all depends on what kinds of kids are going into the library. For young children, stay with the cartoon educational type things. For teenagers, keep it educational but be more relaxed about it. If something offends you, go have a talk with the libraian they woukd probably be happy to take it off the shelf."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3128	2	"Books can be good things, but are they always good? They teach us things, entertain us, and are sometimes good pillows, but they can also be bad things. When a book is inappropriate for the reader, then it should not be on the shelves of the library. Music is the same way.     The library should absolutely take the book off the shelf if it is found offensive by someone. Some books @MONTH1 be offensive in religious ways. A person @MONTH1 believe in something very strongly, and then a book goes and makes fun of it or trashes it in some way. Some @MONTH1 say that the person just shouldn't read the book, but if it were me, I would want the book gone so it didn't remind me of what it had said everytime I walked by it.      Books @MONTH1 even be inappropriate for little kids. It @MONTH1 have language in it that the parents don't like. People have said that they should just make a section for those books to where little kids can't get to them, but you don't know what the childs parents are like. they could think a word is bad when you think it's fine. Everyone is different. Furthermore, a book @MONTH1 contain images not suitable for children. It comes back to what I was saying before, you can't just make a section for these books and say the heck with it. Libraries could even consider censoring some of their books.     Some religions believe that some types of music is the devils music. I know from experience that my mother thinks that scream-o is the devils music. She says that it is not right for them to sing like that and that @CAPS1 wouldn't like it. Other peoples parents @MONTH1 feel the same way.     Magazines @MONTH1 also have words or images in them that someone could take the wrong way. Although I don't believe libraries should remove them, but they should still watch who reads them. They could even put a little label on the front cover of the magazine that says it @MONTH1 not be suitable for everyone.     Books are usually good things, although they can be very bad. In the end, libraries should consider censoring their books, or if the book is bad enough and gets enough complaints, take it off the shelves completely"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3130	2	"offensive materials in libraries should not be taken off of the shelves because of their content. Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could obscure their message. people live around offensivness every day on the street and in public places so censoring it in libraries would not protect anyone. Removing the books from libraries entirely could also interfere with research or school projects children have to work on for class.     Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could potentially obscure a message or major theme of the novel. This style of writing can be seen in @PERSON1's novel To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 by @PERSON1 using terms that are offensive to @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to set the one of the racial tension in the south at that period in time. This type of censorship would also be detrimental if a reader studying the holocaust can not view pictures of death camps because of the graphic nature, the reader would not be able to understand the true horror of the camp without it.     People live around offensivness every day at home, on the streets, and even in school. A normal person encounters several occasions a day where they @MONTH1 hear profanities on the street from passing strangers or friends. Parents sometimes curse or use profanties in front of their children to prove a point or just by accident, and this would expose children to offensive behavior just as much as adults. Children are also exposed to profain language and behavior when they go to school and work around ither childern who might have offensive behaviors.      Censorship of books in libraries could interfere with school or work related projects and research. Censorship could be an issue if a student could not get a book on a major war or event because of graphic nature, and this would hinder the students ability to efficiently complete their assignment. It could also cause problems if a teacher needs to rents a book that has slight profanity in it but is not able to because of the content, inhibiting her from teaching her students about the theme and lesson.     Censorship of books based on the content should not be allowed in libraries. first of all trying to censor a novel might abscure the message or theme. secondly people live around profanity every day so trying to censor it would not protect people because they have likely already heard what is said in the novel. lastly censorship of libraries could interfere with work or school projects or research. If all libraries were censored it could potentially lead to several complications with workers, students, or people who are just looking for a good book to read"	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
3133	2	"To begin with I feel everyone should admire the libraries. I feel this way because at one point of time we didnt even have books let alone libraries to get books from. A library is a place that has a peacful and calm environment. People come to hang out at the library to collect good books, surf the internet, check out new music and aslo to relax.    So to answer the question 'Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the selves at the library if found offensive?' @CAPS1, I believe if things are on the shelf that @MONTH1 come off offensive to people they should absolutely be removed. You shouldn't have to be in an environment were things are offending you. If things seem to come off offending, it will make indivuals stop coming to the library. This will make the library loose alot of business due to lack of service.    The library should be a place that consist of love, peace and harmony. It should be a place were people should feel free and relieved from any stress. By seeing or hearing something that comes off very offensive will tend to bring confusion to the library. This also will make the librarians job much harder than what it should be. They will have to work harder to satisfy the difficulties that you seem to be having with the library.  Something that would offend me in a library is some of the music they carry. Certain types of music shouldnt be found in a library. An  example of some offensive music is the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' music, meaning the music with all types of different profanity. The music that is degrading women in a very disrespectful manner. Also the music that's making it seem cool to be violent.    This will come off offensive to many men and women. Think about it who wants to listen to music thats makes women feel like their not worth anything and who wants to listen to music that's always talking about killing, fighting and gangs etc. People whould like to hear more soothing and relaxing music. The music that makes you happy no matter the mood your in. The library should just pick their music wisely so everyone can be well satisfied.  In conclusion as stated the library is a great place to hang out and just to relax. It should never come off as a place with things that is offensive of so it should get removed. This would keep down less confusion and more people would continue to attend the library because they know what a nice place it really is"	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
3144	2	"Censorship is used in the media to prevent people from being offended by what they see or hear. Although censorship isnt usually a bad thing, it is sometimes over-used. Not everyone has the same views and morals, what @MONTH1 be considered appropriate for some people , @MONTH1 be viewed differently by other cultures or religions.       In my personal opinion if you find something to be offensive, instead of demanding it be removed or censored, simply do not watch, or read it etc. Obviously if the content was published in the first place it appeals to some audience. No one is forceing people to read or watch things, that is why there is something called viewers disgression. If everything that was considered offesive to a certain individual or group where censored , there would be no @LOCATION1. In @LOCATION1, we have freedom of speech, the freedom to write or animate to express any belief we choose. To censor things out is condraticary to that amendmant.    For example the censorship of useing the word '@CAPS1' in vain on television. I myself find this to be excessive because it doesnt apply to my beliefs . Although the program ' The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6' protrays people of my age and nationality getting pregnant and doing drugs. Even though I find this offensive and sterotypical, instead of demanding it be removed, I simply don't watch it.     I am not saying that I am totally against censorship of certain things, like nudity on television. Although if something is censored simply because of a belief, or moral, or worry for a one's children to be subjected to it,that is blowing censorship out of proportion. If you find something offensive just keep yourself and your children away from it."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3148	2	"i believe that there shouldn't be any censorship in libraries. The reason why I say that is because of our first amenment which is freedom of speech we should be able to put anything in books, magazines,music,movies, and etc.. The other reason why we shouldn't take them off the shelf is because we should be able to tell if the book is good enough for your age or your viewings, depends on your point of views.     My first reason is the first amenment which is freedon of speech. The reason why I say that is because we should be able to but what ever in our books that expresses our feelings in any way shape or form. Also, if we start taking stuff away because of censorship in books it will go farther than that and it will come to a point where the first amenment will become cease.      In my culmination I have made my point that there shouldn't be any censorship in anything because of the first amenment. I also said the reason why we shouldn't have censorship is because it's another way to express yourself or your point of views."	3	3		3	2	2	2																		
3149	2	"You know when you find a @LOCATION1 book on the shelf and discover that the content in the book are not word that are oppropity for children to read. Or when you go to copy something and you notice a magazine on the table and find out that the cover of the magazine has an image not for the young mind see. Or a movie or music that you see and the content from them shocks you and makes you that they bleep those word. I see it more better to have offensive items such as: books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. removed from the shelves, because those words and pictures will poison the minds of children and children learn from the world around them stuff like will make the child think that's how your suppose to act and talk. Here two example of why they should be remove from the shelves music and magazines.     First, in deal with music children word immate act they see and the words the say. One good example is rap music: their song have cuss words in them and believe me when I tell you this that I have to constantly to kids at my school saying cuss words like the n- and f-word and many more and seeing some boy's underwear, because they think they are being thugs just because they have their pants sagging low. It drives me crazy and make me think why are their parents letting their children do this. In the next paragraph I will talk about magazines.     Second, with magazine some of the images they use on their covers and pages are something that are ment to be seen where children read. an example for this is when I went into my school library's copying room to copy an article from magazine I found a magazine on the table and it show three of the cast members from @LOCATION1 in their birthday suits. I thought what in the world is this doing at my school they should have something like that in a place where kids are in a learning environment. Why on earth did they send this to a school for crying out loud. What do they think it want bother any kids' parent about it that I sure would be furious about it if I found out that my child had a something that at there school.     In conclusion, this is why they should be removed from the shelves so the children don't see them."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3152	2	"I do not believe that books should be removed from the shelve do to something offensive.Libraries are a very important aspect to life for most people nowadays. Mainly because where I live our city is working on a new plan to close the library nearby.For, me and my friends the library is very important because we do not have a computer in our home.The library has the internet and older books with information on the city.           Living in the society that we have now not every household can afford a computer with internet.Me myself living in one of those households.The library is a great quiet place to get your work done.Its also, provides the internet that people cant afford and need for everyday life.Every job application or school assignment is no longer on paper ,but online.      Being a @NUM1 grade student we have to alot of projects to do that require old books on the city and history.If they remove certain books of the shelve i @MONTH1 not be able to find important information that I need.Also, I know that every person has their own opinion on what is offensive to them ,however if everyone found something offensive in the book, movie or magazine does that mean it should be removed? If that happened there would be a very limited supply of books.    I have a friend who is mixed with mexican and sometimes she finds slavery very offensive ,but to me I believe that it is important for me to learn about my history.Proving that something that might be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive and maybe very important to the other.           In conclusion, I disagree with books being removed from the shelve due to offensive content I believe is wrong.Every person is different and find different things offensive ,but things should not be taken away from another person who @MONTH1 need it"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3154	2	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1,     I think that it is wrong to remove offensive and other non offensive books from the shelves in the library just because one or two students do not like them or do not want to see others reading them.           Somethings are ok for reading and learning although they are indeed offensive it is ok for these matrerials to be left on the shelves, if it will be used for a good purpose such as learning and not just for fun. It is important for readers to be exposed to a broad spectrum of reading materials. Not only should they be exposed to some materials that are not so clean and normal but they should be introduced to things such as foreign writing. If we took everyting off the shelves that was a slight bit offensive or was not completely suited for readers would there be many books that would keep peoples atention?       In conclusion I strongly believe that these materials should be left on the shelf. These materials are important for learning in some cases and keep the readers attention. Keep these items on the shelves!"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3160	2	"What is your opinion on reading materials? Should people be able to read what they want, or should we limit them to what they read? Every library has different choices. They can say you can't get this without an adult, or they can just let you check it out and take it home.     I have read many different things in my lifetime so far. I have read books that people have told me were not appropriate, and then nothing bad was in there. Most books even if they say one to two choice words it turns into an adult book. I think it should be up to the reader, if they can handle a book or not. Everyone reacts to things differently. Let's take people in my age group, for example, some of the boys are still immature, and think it is funny to act out. Those are the kind of people that cannot handle what we call 'adult' material books. Most girls are in the stage where they are maturing, still immature, but working their way up the scale. They would be able to handle something in the adult material category. The reader is smart enough to know what he or she can or cannot handle.     If we take peoples choice away what are they going to have? You would make them feel more like they are being babysat because they have to take their parents to the library, and say hey mommy and daddy pick me out a book because I am not eighteen and cannot pick one. I would not like that. Being one that reads a lot I know my family is pretty busy and would not be able to find time to ride with me to pick a book. Therefore, i would not be able to read as much. I mean what do you think?      Which side would you choose? Everything is a personal opinion. It is all about what you as a reader is comfortable with. Do you want to decide for yourself or have some one with you every step of the way. Some people are just too busy to even try to fit it in their schdule to go to the library. Others just want to have the freedom to read what they want to read. Why stop some one from getting smarter? A child will only learn more by challenging themselves. Why not let them challenge themselves in a good book, that they got to pick out. What do you think"	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
3161	2	"I believe that libraries shouldnt be censored becuase people take offense to something. Everyone should be able to read, research, or watch anything they want at a library. I say this becuase everyone takes offense to something, If people can't find what they're looking for then why go to the library, also everybody likes diffrent things. I'll support them in the following paragraphs.     Have you ever read or seen something that u took offense to you or others? normally when someone takes offense to something they try to get rid of the thing offending them. If people where to take away things that offended them in librarys what would be left of the shelfs? dust? Becuase there are many things that people take offensive, everyone is diffrent. This is one reason I support no on censorship becuase there would be nothing left.     Also everyone tends to like many diffrent things. I @MONTH1 like something you could possibly hate, should it not be aloud in a library becuase you don't like it? No, becuase something you like could be taken away by someone else. So if everyone tried to take away the thing they don't like this would be another thing were nothing would be left. I think that becuase if we combined everyones things that they hate, it would most likely be everything.     These two subjects bring me to my last reason, if people cant find what they want. Becuase it was taken away, why come to a library? People would just stay home to read what they like on the internet and librarys would become empty like there shelfs. Then it was a waste of money to make the building, purchase the books for people, and hire librarians. Thats wasted tax dallors we could have used for something better.     After reading all my reasons and opinions I hope you can agree on not having censorship in libraries. becuase everyone is offended by something, everyone likes diffrent things, and noone would use a library if what they liked wasn't there. some people @MONTH1 disagree with me becuase they're one of these people being offended or not liking something. But say no to censorship, let our libraries do what there for, allow people to read, research, adn watch what the want."	3	3		3	3	3	3

Just think, if you had childern would you want them getting ahold of a magizine with nude men or women in it. Yes people tell you they have control of there kids in stores, but i know you see kids all the time walking away or roming off to try to do what they want, and go to places they shouldnt be like magizines for instence. Would you want to find your little one looking at a magizine with nude wemon in it? Thats not the things kids should be finding in stores, its not nessacary.     Same deal goes with movies, say you rent a movie from one of your many movie places and it has nudity or cursing in it, do want that around your kids? i know i wouldnt, cause kids are like monkeys, monkey see monkey do, and you dont want your little one walking aroud cussing at you. I have little cousins and ive seen it happen many times where they cuss back at there parents, and when the parents ask them where they heard that its usually the same answer, tv or movies.      So do you really think it's nessacary to have all that bad stuff around for anyone, of many ages to see? It's not. Everything like that just needs to be taken off all shelf and destoryed, cause I shouldnt have to see it and niether should anyone else, its gross, nasty, and inrepropriet to childern.

3184	2	"Censorship should only be used for areas in which young children are exposed to, suchs as schools and tv shows intended for young children. Things that aren't intendend for young children should not be censored. If you were to censore everything because some people find it offensive then we would never be able to find new ideas to improve our community.     Censoring books, moives, magazines, and music that aren't intended for young people is a wast of time. If you were to take a book off a shelf that explaind the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 because a person found it offensive then we would never make advansis in technology. Cenosoring items like books is just plane idiotic and ignorant. Studing matireal is our only way to advance in seiance, and if we can't get the right books to studie because they were taken off the shelf due to it being offensive then we will never make brakethoughs in technology.      Parents that feel that books, movies, and magazines should be censored really arent good parents. If they really were consurend with thouse topics then they shouldn't buy them the moives or the books that they find offensive. It seems that parents want to proclaim they want to censore that items because they find it offensive. But not all parents feel the same way, some parents are open with their children about these topics and feel that their chilren are mature enough to handle things like these.     As a child I wasn't shielded from these kinds of situations. I grew up with out censoreship. I wacthed movies and read book that were never censored, and I was mature enough to know what it all ment. I see why parents want to censore that kids from topics like thouse, but they never take the time to talk to their children about these topic and see if that are mature enough to hanld it.     Censoreship is great for childrens tv shows. But when you start to censore someones ideas because you find them offensive and wrong then you are being ignorant. People here have freedom of speech and desirve the right to not have there work censored because a small group finds it offensive.

3187	2	"The media is a way for some people to get out and reach others. Whether it is a magazine, movie etc everyone in the world is going to see it some way or another. If that piece of work isn't seen as acceptable from many peoples point of views it shouldn't be available to the public.       I personally beleive that if something is seen as volgure and offence it shouldnt be displayed. Millions of people will be viewing this and I wouldn't want my kid looking at it. Why would anyone else want the opposite? Kids pay attention to detail really well and something so negative could change the mindset of the child. We all want to bring our kids up right and letting them have availabilty to negative material is uncalled for.  Its not only kids either that are affected, adults also are affected by the media. Adults can get fooled too, beleive me.      I remember one time that there were books and magazines at my school that were being taken off shelves for this exact same reason. I beleive that what the librarians did was right. Some kids in the school shouldn't be viewing or reading about unacceptable things. Some students @MONTH1 not have matured enough and can take something in a different view than another student.      I beleive that if something is taken off a shelf because it doesn't seem appropriate enough I stand for whoever it is that did it.

3188	2	"I think that they should remove books, and take away more stuff from the kids now a days, because they are getting worse in worse like everyday, i think they should move the @NUM1 to @NUM2, so atleast they are old enough to read, hear, or watch whatever they want, but they should go through and do a self-check on everything that they put out  in the stores.They should also have different parts in a library so that the little ones dont get to the adult section, such as adult books, that have stuff in them about sex, drugs, or anything else that falls under that catagory. I have @NUM3 little brothers, and they are @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6. They know more stuff then my parents, and its because now a days kids pick up on stuff a lot more easier. So i say we as in the @LOCATION1 citizens need to watch out on how we put stuff out there that the kids can get a hold of.          When i was growing-up i didnt know as much as my little brothers do today, and that is because everyday they are coming out with something else everyday that can effect our kids, brothers, or whoever. I also do think the schools should have a class about the stuff that kids are experiencing in todays life, in like elementary school, so that when they get older they will already know about the drugs, or the sex life. Kids also remember stuff a lot more when they are growing up, so if we put it in there heads at a really really young age, they will remember it. Im not saying that kids will stop doing what they are doing, but atleast the percent population will go down, and parents will be a lot more happier. I also think that parents should stop lying to there kids about sex, making up stories so that there kid wont know, they need to stop doing that because they are going to find out about it sooner or later, so why not now? they whould be more aware of the real life in how it is out there, so all the parents out there should not lie to there kids about the sex life.

3197	2	"I don't think censorship is right for our public libraries.   In my opinion, it depends on what they are saying or what they are showing. Also, it depends on what what the ages the kids are or adults. People are different in many ways. It also depends on the way they take it in their signifaction.     If they move books, music, movies, and magazines off the shelves because their offensive that wouldn't be a very good idea because how would other people get ahold of it and want to read it in life, if they get taken off the shelves? Some people enjoy actually reading that stuff and nothing else. I just don't think that people would be to happy. Also, they're different cultures in these countries that read stuff like that.      People would like to learn about different things. If people took the books and other things like that off the shelves, there would be hardly anything to read. Childrens and up to adult books has all different kinds of things. The books and things like that you can read can have more things in it besides offensive things, sometimes they can have more information in those books than others.      In my conclusion, censorship is not good in our public libraries because it taking basic things out of the libraries and taking half of the reading from people."	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
3200	2	"I believe that censorship should be allowed when it comes to certain things but I don't believe censorship belongs in public libraries.  Books are wrote to stimulate the imagination of a persons mind and if they cannot read books that are the slightest offensive, then they will never know what it is like to open some of the greatest books ever wrote until that person has grown up.  And there are several studies that show that books stimulate the human mind and taking away these books would be a crushing blow to those statistics.     For example, a student has been assigned a report on a piece of classical literature.  So he/she goes to the public library to find a good book, but when that student gets the he/she finds out that all pieces of classical literature have been removed from the library due to being overly offensive.  What would that person do?  Should he/she just give up because every single piece of classical literature has been taken out of every library in the country, I say no!       This is a problem because almost every great book ever wrote has at least a few parts where it is slightly offensive to that certain reader.  From personal experience I can back this statement up with books I have read going through my school career.  For example, when I was in the @NUM1 grade  was assigned a book report over @PERSON1, so I went to our library in the school to look for this book and it was nowhere to be found.  I asked the librarian where this book was and she said that it had been removed due to being offensive to the black population for having the word negro inprinted on its pages.  So I asked her if I could go tot the public library to get the book and she said that it had been removed from its shelves as well.  I did not know what to do, I was completely clueless and I had no book to write my report over.  So eventually the teacher had to change the report topic because not on student was able to find @PERSON1.  But if the state had not allowed these books to be taken off of the shelves then we would not have had this problem.     Another example was when my friend @PERSON2 wanted to learn about his culture and where his ancestors came from.  But when he got to the library he could not find any books over the arabic world.  So he asked the librarian 'where are all the books covering @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION1?'  And the librarian said that they were all removed because after @NUM2 @CAPS1 saw arabs as very offensive people and that no books were left unchecked.  I'm sure that he found this comment to be very offensive but there was nothing that he could do about it because the white people found arabs to be offensive and unequal to the white race.     These are only a few things that have already happened becaue of people finding certain books to be offensive, which is why I believe that the government should leave all the books on the shelves and let the people decide to pick up that book or pass it by.  Sure people have a freedom of speech but it should not effect what books belong on the shelf.  Which is why I believe that censorship should not be allowed to effect libraries of the public."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3207	2	"Should certain books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive. Books, movies, magazines, music are made to relay a message, express a point of veiw, or to perhaps state an oppionion, of which everyone has a different point of veiw.     No, books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should not be simply taken off of the shelves or out of stores. All of the previously listed things are rated. Movies are rated @CAPS1 through @CAPS2, books are rated child through adult, and music if explicit has a parental advisery sticker, so just follow the ratings. IF a four-year old tried to buy two tickets to see a rated @CAPS2 movie the theater would not sell him the tickets because he is not yet off age. People @MONTH1 bring the point of maybe a child picks up a adult book or magazine in a store and begins to look at it and read it. The solution to that problem is simple create a seperate room in stores that sell these items and label the room adult section. Have cameras near by so if a yongster feels brave enough to tempt fate they will be caught or just put a desk out front of the adult section and require an i.d. for entrance. These are still books which are expressions of a persons dreams, hope, desires, fantasies, and heart, they should not be denied there dream because a person deems it unfit. And most apparent if it offends you dont read it.     Simply follow the rating rules. Take necesary precations. If all of these rules are followed then buisnesses and libraries should have no probles keeping everybody safe and happy."	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
3213	2	"I believe that some materials are offensive to some people, but that shouldn't give them a right to want to take it off the shelves. No, I do not agree with taking them off the shelves because people could easily over look them and not read them. Some people @MONTH1 think they are offensive but they should know that they are not directed twards them. Magazines are different because they have peoples faces on the front cover which is uncalled for. Some of those people have a family, and doesn't want them to see their face on the front cover of a magazine.     Katherine Paterson's quote is about wanting to remove books from the shelves so that childern won't be tempted to read them. If this is the case I think that its not the right thing to do. Some of those books people are taking off the shelves could be the book someone can use to relate to or even learn from. Weather or not you want your children to read them or not they could still find them and ask why they have never seen it before and parents wouldn't know what to say.     Libraries are a resource to people that want to read and learn about new things. If you took a book off of a shelf, that could be the book someone really needs. Don't be that person to take away from a child's learning. You never know who is going to look for what your have taken away. And if you take it away they @MONTH1 never find it.       Some people believe that reading something can be an influence to the way they act, but you cannot blame that on reading. That's like saying that your favorite color is lime green because thats @PERSON2's favorite color. Its not true and it sure isn't right. What would you do if your parents hid a book or something else from you? You would be mad at them and wonder why. It would make you anxious to read it. If they didn't hide it and you found it maybe you wouldn't want to read it because your parents would have let you see it and you wouldn't be interested.      You have your own choice when it comes to what your children read, watch, and listen to. Just don't shut them out of what you read because you were offended. Think about it, the music, movie, or book your hiding from them could be the answer to a lot of things. It could help them figure out the path they want to take, or maybe the path they don't want to take. Either way it would help them be a success in their life. So why not take the risk? It could even help you."	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
3218	2	"I believe that certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc. shouldn't be removed from the shelves. I say this because, what @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not come close to being offensive to another. There are many different types of books, movies and even some music that have some history to it, it @MONTH1 be offensive, but to some certain race or culture it's history.          What @MONTH1 be historical or even informational to one person it will be offensive to the other and vice versa. If everybody had a chance to go into the biggest library made and take something that @MONTH1 be offensive to them down I think that the library would have little to no books in it. Katherine said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' meaning if parents or teenagers took 'offensive' material off the shelf that there will be nothing else left.          A lot of things are offensive because of religion beliefs, but not everybody has the same religion or even a religion at all. Just like religion shouldn't be taught in public schools, censoring shouldn't be allowed in public libraries. If censoring did happen in public libraries, I'm sure there will be protests and possibly riots over this censoring.            People said that @PERSON2 was a bad man, well if we take books and movies off the shelves showing what he did, I believe history will be more likely to repeat itself. A lot of things have been bad in history that we read about today, like gangs, if we don't read about the wrong they do or see the movies to show how it would be like if you were a gang member would there be an increase in gang activity and members? this is why I believc we shouldn't take books, magazines, movies, etc. off of the shelves"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3221	2	"Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found affensive? No, I do not believe that. Simply because if one person is offended by a book and or materials in a library someone else will argue because they like the thing that was taken out of place for that person's beliefs and values.           I believe that if you don't like what is in the library you go to then don't go back, or just keep to yourself at least don't make a scene. There are a lot of racism being thrown around in books and songs and magazines but nobody takes that away. You just don't listen to it or you don't read it. If you would like to protest something that isn't in your beliefs or something that offends you, then go right ahead. It's good to defend yourself.      I remember when I was about @NUM1, I went to a hotel in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS4 family and a family friend. And the guy @CAPS4 dad invited to come was @PERSON1. He isn't racist but he does joke about how people dress and he sometime gets out of hand with @CAPS6 comments on the racist names, but we tolerate him. So we go to check in at the hotel and the check in/ check out person at the counter was @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We pay for our room with no problem and we stand there patiently waiting for @PERSON1 to step up and ask for a room. @CAPS4 father asked him what he was doing, because he was just standing there looking at the person behind the counter. @PERSON1 looks at us and smiles, then he pulls out a pamplet from @CAPS6 shoulder bag and hands it to the girl behind the counter. @CAPS3 I have no idea what the pamplet said or what kind of pictures was on it, but when he handed it to her she dropped it, looked up at him with tears in her eyes, and flipped him off then walked to the back and got this man.      As this rather large man walks around the counter towards @PERSON1 @CAPS4 father steps in the picture. @CAPS4 dad starts to talk to the guy but he doesn't seem to notice @CAPS4 dad because he was so focused on @PERSON1. @PERSON1 says, ' @CAPS3 look I was only kidding with the girl, she needs to learn how to take a joke.' @CAPS4 mom takes  me and @CAPS4 brothers up to our room and trys to get @CAPS4 father to come with us instead he promises us he'll be right up.      A good half an hour later @CAPS4 dad comes through the door with @PERSON1 close behind. I asked them what was on the paper he handed the lady, and @CAPS4 father says it was an aids pamlet he got from a rest stop. I looked at @PERSON1 and I said, '@CAPS5'd you give that to her?' @CAPS6 reply was well @CAPS7 a lot of people have aids but it's kind of an iside joke about 'blacks' and aids. So I just didn't really pay much attention to him anymore and I talked to @CAPS4 father. @CAPS4 dad said the reason @CAPS5 she got so upset was because her mother died from aids just a year ago. Which of course @PERSON1 never knew about all that. But I'm sure he learned @CAPS6 lesson. He should have just left her alone.      So you see these things are a problem but nobody removed us. We stayed there all weekend. Of course her and @PERSON1 exchanged some hateful looks but we looked past that, and she moved on with her life. I still don't think you should have to remove something just because someone esle don't like it"	3	4		3	4	3	4																		
3230	2	"I thank that all of the books and movies and more should not  be censorship because people have a right to no what they what to no or see.      They need to learn from books so people can learn from history and so that @CAPS1 war @NUM1 want happen again.     The libraries is for freeom to read to do want you want and look up.     In the newspaper and magazines people like to no that happens in the @CAPS1 or to people if its bad or not, because no how that cant happen to them, some people mite thank that people not read watch something but are they to tell what to do they can there own dishens"	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
3231	2	"I can think of several books that, I would not want a child of mine to pick up and read. I as soon as I seen what I was going to be writing about this one flashed in my head like lighting. The book that @CAPS1 choosing is called '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.'      The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' is about a young girl that grew up without a father. Her mother never wanted to talk about him because, she knew that this way only going to make matters worse. The young girl grew up with the dream of being daddy's little girl.That's all she wanted out of life. She sit and thought is that just a little to much to ask for.      After a few years, had passed by she had finally got the nerve to go on a hunt for father. She went by herself, leaving her mother behind.Her mother always pumped in the head that her father was up to no good. That she would be better off without him there. But, she went on the hunt of her father by faith in the lord.      After saying many prayers to the lord, she finally thought that.She just @MONTH1 knew what this hunt was going to take. So she went to her @CAPS9, hoping that she @MONTH1 just have the anwsers. That she needed to solve her heartace and pain. That she could just walk @CAPS4 knowing that somewhere out there in the world that her father would be waiting for her.       It's was just before the sun was beginning to sit, when she noticed a little old southern bell. Sitting out on the front porch in a wooden rocking chair. She went up to her @CAPS9 and kissed her on the forehead,with tears filled in her eyes.Her @CAPS9 said 'now dear why must you be crying.' @CAPS8, with the lump in the throat she asked 'do you know where I @MONTH1 find my father?' @CAPS9 answered with yes! Dear, @CAPS2's laying down in his bed. That's when her face began to glow.     She went in the old cottage to find her father lying on the bed writing her. She was nervous but with the help of her @CAPS9 she sit and talked with her father.Her father told her that her had wrote her a letter everyday.That's @NUM1 letters a year. She told her father that I've never recieved a letter from you in my entire life span. That's when it clicked to her that @MONTH1 be why her mother never let her check the mail.     After @NUM2 years had passed by she finally found her father. Truth was that her father @CAPS3 out of his daughters life because, the mother didn't want him to be a part of her life. She did whatever it took to keep them apart, even if that meant going aganist law orders. Father explained that her mother needed her there to look after her because, her was into some heavy drugs at the time. Back then there was nothing @CAPS2 could do to take his daughter @CAPS4 from her mother.      The reason I choose this book was because, when I was young my father did the same to me. @CAPS2 left me and I've never had the chance to get to know my family. The pain of growing up without either mom nor dad is tuff. You cry many tears and try to patch up the holes in you heart. Sometime's the bleed still seemeds to find it's way through. After reading the book I always wondered why they called her she. They called her she because, she took the blame for her father walking out of her life.      Many children are growing up without mom or dad. There's a higher percentange of single parent family's now days than before.Just like in the book most kids take the blame for a parnet not being there. If I could take that book off the shelf, then I would because, no child needs to be reminded of the pain they went through.Would you do the same if you were looking out for your child?      All these children want is to know there loved and that someone cares about them.If your going to have these types of books then there needs to be a form for the parnets to fill out giving permission. If they are over age then that's total fine. They're at the age where they should be able to handle it, than going through these feeling alone"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3241	2	yes i thinck they should take efence books off the shelf because little likd read the books then they will probley be tought rong from right. And if the books had vilance then they will thinck tkat is right to.	1	1		1	1	1	1																		
3244	2	"Some books are not suitable for kids. They could make a section for adults that includes books that are not censored. These books should not be aloud to be checked out by kids under the age of @NUM1 unless their parent or guardian allows them to. Some adults don't care what there kids read but the library should. I've read books at school that were adult books at school.      Back in elementary school, I remember checking out alot of books but I don't think they were adult books. Some kids enjoy reading adult books. It helps their reading skills but the content in the book is not suitable for them.     Making a section for adults would help stop kids from reading adult material. I believe that this should take place at every library around the world."	2	2		2	3	3	3																		
3247	2	"Do you believe that certain materials in the library should be removed off the shelf if found offensive?     I believe certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Some of my reasoning is very logical and if you were a reader I'm sure you want to read something thats true and very interesting. Libraries all consist of books from everything you can think of. Libraries are really for learning and not to offense anybody in any manner.     The reason why I believe they should not be removed because everybody is equal and not everybody likes to read the same books. There should be offensive books because I think that theres just to many kids that would not like to grab a book and it be orginal and not offensive about them in some way. Books are created to read and have interest, laughter, enjoying. From some of the students at my school I spoke with said that when they are really having a bad day they turn on their music and it helps them because it makes them feel alot better and the day gets easier for them. They say they dont have to be depressed or thinking about something that made them mad that day.     Well as in from my experience with books I can tell you somethings and sometimes that when I was feeling down how I grabed a book. The first time I realized books are really helpful and I'm also talkling about magazines, music and movies. Well to be honest I'm not a big reader. I enjoy listening to music because sometimes songs can relate to you and make you fell  that your not alone. Also it helps you learn how to cope with some things that you could of never coped with before because it makes you feel relaxed. Just how some of my friends said that they feel relaxed when they read a book.     So my point is that you know and I know that their are music out there that is very offensive and some books that are.  Does it drive us crazy that they do? No it does not because it actually helps us. It helps us by showing us away out from our daily streesful lifes and sometimes you learn in books and songs of how other people deal with their stress. So you learn alot of things than feel offensive about books or music. As you can tell I'm a huge music fan and there has been lots of songs that were offensive but it did not bug me much.         I hope I gave you some kind of shock that music and books should'nt be removed if offensive. It's just music is amazing as well for books we all need our space sometimes and those two things are just there for us which is either to help us learn or feel relaxed and calm. Thank you for reading this and I hope I persuaded you enough with my reasoning. Remember music and books are alot alot of fun and if you never gave it a chance, you should try it sometime. That's the end of my conclusion"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3256	2	"I myself beleves that censorship in libraries should not be aloud. If their was to be any cersorship it should be from the parents of a child or if your not a child then you dont need censored. By censoring something as small as books, movies, and so on I think it will give people a fake sense of what really happens. Just because something isent censored doesnt mean it should be taken out of context eather.     Think of it like this if you walking down a street its not going be censor people will say bad words, show bad habits, and even go as far as seeing death or more. Being a kid who really never been censored from anything including books ive learned alot but I feel as if I went to a librarie to get a book and if censored or taken off the shelf then I will shown a fake world. Once again if life cant be censored then we shouldnt consor anything else.     A censored book, movie or whatever it @MONTH1 be could also determin how much someone could learn from it. People go to liraries to learn hard facts with proff and evadience and depending on the subject in witch their looking up.     This is some of meny reasons I think cendor in libraries shouldnt be aloud. Consorship should be chosen by who you are not by outher people. In the end we @MONTH1 never know whats better till we try."	3	3		3	2	2	2																		
3257	2	"No because the writer is explain th way the story really happend.If ur kid ask u the word tell him/her it not a good word to say, r u can take the book back and get him/her a new one.          Say him/her kids comes home from school and say a couse word and u asked him/her were they learned it from. An they said the teacher said it. U can tell the teacher u dont wounting ur him/her reading that book.                                                                Cousing is a way of explain the story better to them i guess."	1	1		1	1	1	1																		
3268	2	"Books are books, and as well as magazines, music, movies, etc., therefore one purpose only right? To read them well thats what I thought. Even though books, magazines and even some movies might offend some people, that doesn't mean they should be tooken off the shelf.      I think they shouldn't be tooken off the shelves. Beacuse if someone just like you wrote it, someone like you will probably be even more willing to read it. Though sometimes the books and magazines are inappropriate and @MONTH1 offend some people, doesn't mean they should remove them entirely because sometimes people need to read things there not completely comfortable with. Because reading about things that you don't know about entirely sometimes helps you learn not to do those bad things. It also helps prevent some kids to not smoke and do drugs if they hear or look at those things from experience.     Books and magazines that offend people are only telling them what they don't want to hear. Even though you @MONTH1 not want to hear about it, drugs and sexual content are always going to be in the surroundings of our children to see or experience. Putting a book or a magazine about drugs in libraries are not going to make kids or people try drugs. Its the people that can't control themselves when they get around it or see it or even hear about it. It's called self control and some people have it some people don't. Reading a book about drugs will only prevent things like that from happening.     So I think libraries should just leave the books on the shelves. If some people don't want to see it in their local libraries then they don't need to pick up the book, magazine or watch the movie. These books and magazines and movies only help us become stronger people. They also help us as a community to try and stay clean. These books are very important to the community to read so they don't ever get the tendency of doing those bad things.     This is why I think books that offend some people should't be removed from the libraries. The libraries itself just need to move the books and magazines to another section of the library if they don't want to see or accidentally read about something that could possibly offend them. This could help the people avoid such things. Libraries just need to keep the books and magazines and movies on the shelf. Just as they are today in our local library"	3	3		3	3	2	3																		
3291	2	"Should public libraries have to censor some of the books, movies, and music they have on display? In my opinion they shouldn't have to. We as people have the right to learn, read, and expand our minds in whatever way we see right for us. There are three main reasons as to why I feel 'offensive' pieces of writing, movies, and music should be allowed in public libraries. One reason as to why they should not is that people have been writing and expressing themselves throughout history; therefor, there are far too many pieces that we would have to get rid of in order to eliminate them all. The second reason is that people have different opinions as to what is 'offensive' and what is not. The third reason that will be elaborated on is that people will be exposed to whatever it is you try to hide, if not throught the art of music, movies, or books, then through the real world we live in.     Throughout history, man kind has been writing things down to document experiences, events, and ideas that have happend throughout history. With those expierences come profanity, sexuality, death, and abundant amounts of situations that the public eye might consider 'offensice'.  If you were to try and delete these pieces, one you would be destroying a big part of history, and two there are far too many books, movies, and music pieces that you would have to get rid of. In almost every form of art there is some remark to something negative. If you were to take them out, you would be left with very few, if any books.     The second reason is that poeple have different opinions on what is bad, and what is not. For example, I was going on a band trip with all the other band students, and on the way there we put on a movie. We ended up having to turn off the movie, because one parent found it inappropriate. While that parent didn't like it, other parents were upset we turned it off, because they saw nothing wrong with it. The same rules apply with books and music. It all depends on personal views as to it being 'offensive' or not.      The third reason is that poeple will expierence all of the things you are trying to hide. If you take it out of the library, one will hear about it on the news, on the radio, in a restraunt, in schools, just about anywhere they are. Taking out the pieces in the library, will be useless in the long run. For example, people want to take out a book called, 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' because it uses the word 'nigger' in the story quite a few times. There are a lot of people that feel it is not appropriate enough to be taught in school. On top of that, they want to get rid of all the books that say 'nigger' and replace them with books that say 'slave' instead. In my opinion that would be a stupid thing to do, because it takes away the authentisity and effectiveness out of the book. In the book when they use the word it is very powerful and makes you think. If you replace it with 'slave' that statement or passage loses its power on its readers.     In conclusion, I strongly feel that libraries should not have to take out the 'offensive' books, music, or movies. If it does happen, we would be deleting part of our history and knowledge. With that if we do it, how will we know what books to take out, if everyone has a different opinion on what is 'offensive' and what is not. Finally, should we do this, it will not solve anything. People in today's society will still be mean, still do sexual things, people will still use harsh language, and people will still expierence 'offensive' actions. That is the society we live in and poeple will have to accept that fact. That is why I feel that we need to keep all of the 'offensive' pieces we have, that way the people reading them might be ready for the real world once it hits them."	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
3294	2	"I believe that if you hear or read something offensive they should stay for many reasons. I feel everyone should know the history of the world, whch means rascitism or being offended. I feel if you are reading a book or listening to music and you hear something offensive to you , just turn it off.  You aren't being force to listen or read it, its your choice.      Libraries should keep the materials cause the people of the world should know how it feels to be offended. I certainly don't like the feeling of being offended, but its something people go through life with. There @MONTH1 be people out there that probably disargree's with me, its just my oponion. You @MONTH1 go to the certain libraries in the world that doesn't allow certain people in because of their oponions on the selection of materials the library offers.     I once heard a woman at a library talking about how she went to the police about someone writing offensive things towards her religion on the internet @CAPS1 happen to the person but, its the fact that she went to the police. She could have handle the sitiutation herself, by just comforting the person about it. I feel that the mintue she started to read it, she should have turned away or got off the website. It was her decision to keep reading it. I don't see why she should go to the police, if it was just the person's oponion.      Libraries should keep the materials cause maybe someone wants to know the meaning of being offensive or being offend. Libraries shouldn't have to hide this topic from anybody. People are offensive because they were rasied or just born that way. Some people just have to deal with these people. They might not like it or @MONTH1 do somethings towards them in there lifetime but, they have to live with them.     In the end, either if they want to or not libraries should keep certain materials out even if they are offensive towards people. Libraries shouldn't just change there ways for certain people that don't like the materials. They are plenty people of the world that want to learn more on the topic.

There are many possible answers to this question, but I believe that if someone does not like a certain book or finds it offensive they should not have the right to take it off the shelf.     I believe that him/her should not be able to take it off the shelf because if that person finds it offensive, there are others who would not find it offensive. For example, @PERSON1 might want to read a book about abortion, but @CAPS1 is against and offended by that book or subject. If that book is taken off the shelf, it is restricting other people, such as @PERSON1, who would like to learn or read about that specific subject.      Another reason why I think that certain books, magazines, music, or movies should not be taken off the shelf is because if one book is offensive to some people, then another book @MONTH1 be offensive to others as well. So, if there are people who find some books offensive, and are then taken away; there will be a little amount of books for the other students to read.     Even though certain books @MONTH1 offend people, I think the book or magazine should not be removed from the library or shelf. I believe that if someone does not like a certain book, magazine, movie, music, ect., that person should not have the right for that book or any other material to be taken away. They should not be taken away because other people might want to read that book, and secondly, that would leave a lot less books for other people to read and learn information about."	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
3297	2	"There are many books that are not appropriate for childeren or teenagers, though they can still check the books out in the library. They can take them home, read it, and discover some things that shouldn't be discovered at their age. Childeren check out rated @NUM1 movies and rated @CAPS1 movies and unedited @CAPS2's and they learn a lot of bad things or words that they should not use at the age their age.     The libraries are supposed to make sure your @NUM2 years of age before you check out a rated @CAPS1 movie. Also you have to be a certain age to buy @CAPS2's and games that are for the elderly teenagers. You should have to be a certain age to check out or buy a movie or anything that has vulger language. Today kids aren't as mature as they used to be. Things today are way different.     My opinion is that teenagers should have to be a certain age to rent or buy things that are bad but I have read some books that were not really all that great for my age either. I guess it is just how mature you are and ready to accept vulger things. It should have to be your parents decision to see if your ready or not.       My final conclusion is that it depends on how mature you are and if you think your ready. The stores and libraries should set limits on books and ages. Although some people will not agree. There should be boundaries for teenagers and age privelages and they should respect them enough not to do them"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3302	2	"I believe as a citizen of this city and as a avid library goer, that censorship in libraries is neccessary. Some of the material in the libraries @DATE1 are very graphic and sometimes quite a bit offensive. Do we really want our children looking at half-nude people or the murder of innocent people just because of their skin color?     In @DATE1's libraries there are many books and movies that represent racism. Take for instance the movie '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1.' In the movie the white children get yelled at because they are playing with the @CAPS3-@CAPS4 children. This is a wonderful example of why censorship is neccessary. Just think, if your child were to watch this and then go and say something rude to one of their friends, who is @CAPS3-@CAPS4, it would be very offensive to them. Although this movie is about historical events, it still needs to be taken off the shelves, in @CAPS1 opinion.     In @DATE1's society, nudity is becoming a big issue in movies and also in books. You @MONTH1 think that it is okay to let  your child watch a movie rated @NUM1, but little did you know, there is nudity in it. Depending on how old your child is, and if you let them on the computer or not, they might think it is okay to go and look up nude pictures on the internet.      Also, in books this is becoming an issue. It was just the other day I sat down to read a book about a musical that I wish to see, and there were nude pictures in it. Once I found this out, I asked @CAPS1 mother to please take it back. These are the sort of things that need to be taken off the shelves of our libraries.     Language usage in music is also a big deal. Many rap artists think it is okay to use offensive and explicit language in their music. I do not think they take into consideration that young children will be listening to their music. This genre of music needs to be taken off the shelves. You @MONTH1 think it is okay for your young child to listen to it now, but just wait until those words make it into their vocabulary.     I think that library censorship is a big deal that needs to be taken into deep consideration. It @MONTH1 be different at first, especially when you go in to get your favorite rap tape, or your favorite @NUM1 movie, but trust me in the long run, you will thank the library for taking it off the shelves. Especially when you get older and have children. You will not want them listening, reading, or watching the things you watched as a child"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3305	2	"Why should books or other such ideas but lets get back to the subject. Should certain books be aloud to be in a libary. Cause if u dont have certain books you would have to read the same book over and over. But there are all kinds of books that you can pick you have history,poems,dramas,love,scary. But some are not aporpit for certain places.     Certain music is ok but there are some that I would not aprove of. Like there rap its a bunch of people rymes. That people think up in there heads about life. Something that they want to express by telling raping. There is rock in roll alot of people did not care for it.     When it was intruduces in the late @NUM1 but as time went on people started listening to it. But alot of people did not want there kids listening. To that back then they said it was devil music. But in this day in age alot of people still listen to rock n roll. Cause they were brought up on that kind of music.     Movies there is a lot of diffent movies out there. There @NUM2 and rated @CAPS1 but alot of partents do not let there kids. Watch certain movies because they scare there kids. They are so ugly and gross that some people cant stand it. But there are shows for kids to there like a movie but a little shorter.     Magazines just are a new thing that people are trying out. But mostly old people read magazines cause they have alot of time on there hands. But there are some people who cant get ehogh of magazines. Cause they want to buy every thing in the book. It catchs there eyes bye the way it looks . But there is all kinds of diffent magazines mucle, food ,cleaning, toys.      But thats what I think about this kind . Of stuff it sucks people in but some cant get out. By the time they get out they are broke"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3316	2	"Censorship is a topic that it strongly opinionated. If one person does not like the content of a text, that person could might find themselves saying that they have to right to obstain from being able to view that text in a library, public location, or online source. But what about the other people? Shouldn't they have a say too?     Let's say that 'person one' does not agree with the language in a text, but 'person two', perhaps does. Which person has the benefit in @CAPS1 situation? Freedom of speech and expression are two factors that are very valued, and pherhaps sometimes even overlooked in our society. In @CAPS1 case, both 'person one' and 'person two' are allowed have a right to say and think what they feel about the text.      Should 'person one' still have the right to say that @CAPS1 text does not belong in a public location? Well, if every person had the right to remove something that they disagreed with from the public, there nothing would be left. In such a large and diverse society, there is bound to be at least one person who does not agree with the content of a certain material of each and every lyric, magazing, book, and text that there is avalible.      Some might say that @CAPS1 is unfair to that one group who does not agree with the content of a material. But how is that fair to the other group who actually do agree with that material? Freedom of speech and expression are still not being excluded from that group who does not agree with such material. That group is still allowed to speak their opinions and takes on that particular material, as well as the people who do agree with the material.      Take iTunes for example. If there is a song that has language and/or content that could be considered disrespectful to a person, there is a red tag by the song that says: 'explecit.' @CAPS1 is an indecator that a person who could find foul language offensive, that such person should no buy that song. There is also the compromise. Quite often, if a song is tagged as 'explecit', the is usually an alternative of the same song. That same song is then tagged with a gray tag that states: 'clean.' A song being 'clean' simply means that the song is still the same, but the considered to be disrespectful content is removed, or removed and replaced with different words that are not considered to be disrespectful. Both parties are now satisfied with the so called: happy-median.      Take movies as another example. Movies are rated based on their content. The higher the rating, the more explecit such movie is. Along with the rating, there is an explanation as to why that movie is rated the way that it is. If you are a person who is careful about viewing things that are against your own opinions and beliefs, then by seeing the rating and explanation, such person knows that @CAPS1 material is not for them. Again, the happy-median.     For every given case of a goup of people who do not agree with the terms of a certain content, the alternate group must be considered as well. Both parties in @CAPS1 case are still able to say and express their own opinions. So, should @CAPS1 context be removed from the eye of the public because a certain group of people do not agree with the content in it? No. However, one must keep in mind the views and opinions that each person has on such material, and that person should still be respected for their take on that material"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3335	2	"I think books, movies, music, and magazines that are offensive should not be pulled from the shelfs. If you find something offensive then dont pick it up, its that simple. You @MONTH1 find something offensive but it might not be to someone else. It is all according to you own personal opinion.     Sure, there are somethings that are very offensive to certain people, and those people will try to put a stop to it. But I think that is wrong. Because it @MONTH1 be offensive to you but what if there is somone studying that topic but cant find the information on it because you thought it was offensive and got it pulled off of the shelf. Then it disrupts that persons study.      I am not promoting violent books and movies or other offensive material, all im saying if you find something offensive then turn the other cheek. It @MONTH1 be offensive to you but other people @MONTH1 not think the same way.     There are many books and movies out there that are offensive to many people. And if we were to take all of those movies and books off of the shelf then there would be very few subjects and title to read and watch.     In my conclusion, I support the fact that offensive material should stay on the shelfs. It could be helpful to many people and at the same time it can be offensive to alot of people. But if you are one of those people that find something offensive then dont pay any attention to it and find another subject or topic. For someone to take another persons right to read a book or watch a movie is wrong everyone has their own opinions and rights"	4	3		4	4	4	4																		
3347	2	"Censorship in the world is getting worse everyday. Many people believe that some material is unsuitable. I believe that if it is unsuitable for others does not make it unsuitable for some. I believe people have the right to read,watch, or listen to what they want as long as it is not breaking any laws. I am torn on this topic because I am against censorship, but I am also for it when laws are being broken.     I believe that people should have the right to read whatever they want. Granted, some people read very incriminating books that could get them in a lot of trouble, but not everyone should be punished for another persons mistake. Sometimes you hear about terrorist groups and other illegal groups, but usually they do not market to everyday people. I think that when it becomes a threat to the @LOCATION1 they should remove material.     Another simple fact is that the constitution @LOCATION1 that we have the freedom of @CAPS1, which basically means we @MONTH1 print and read whatever we want. Many people depend on the constitution to make their lives seem safer and sometimes there is a book,article, movie, or a song that goes beyond our limits. I believe that some people use materials wrongly sometimes to get ahead and to make a name for themselves. I just think that people should write for the pure joy of it, not to persuade people to do something bad,or give bad thoughts or ideas.     The government has the right to control what we partake in, but does that seem fair? I understand thier logic behind this matter, but just because it has offensive matter does not mean they should remove it from society. I believe that if people want to experience it they should be able to without wondering if it will gone the next day. If people do not agree with this 'offensive' matter, then they should not take part in it. This is a true enough statement that it just makes you wonder about their logic.     So, does the government have the right to say what we can and cannot read? I don't believe so, but that is my opinion. I believe that people should read whatever they so choose to and should not think they are breaking laws for some 'offensive' material. Freedom of the @CAPS1 is what people have to look up to for the government, but how are people supposed to feel secure when they are reading a book, watching a movie, or listening to music that @MONTH1 be assumed 'offensive'."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3354	2	"I dont believe that it should matter what books are in a library. If you think a book would be offensive to you, dont read it. If you were to read a book with opinions about a cirtian race or religion, just keep your opinion to yourself. Most people make a big deal about cirtian things to get attention.      If a library was split up into sections about topics and such, it would help a lot, and it would be a quicker way to get your books and get out to make room for others. I honestly have not seen a @CAPS1 in a school library, but its probly because I did not spend much time lookin for it. And if there isnt one, its probly because someone complained about it.     If you are religious, you should have the right to be able to read what you want. Theres all kinds of weird books in the library, and a lot of people just look at them for the fun of it. I dont know why some people have so many problems with certian things. Like I said before, if you dont like it, dont read it"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3362	2	"Dear @CAPS1:     Have you ever seen an offensive book on a shelf in a library? Would you want your children influenced by these findings? These are the question you need to ask yourself about certain materials that appear in libraries.      As a concerned citizen I am writing to you to relect my opinion on censorship in libraries. In my own personal experiences I have come across magazines, books, and music that are offensive. I believe that these materials should not be found in libraries. There are many people that still would want these materials, so my suggestion is that there should be a seperate room for the offensive materials. If there was a seperate room, we can keep these materials away from young kids. When I get older and have children, I believe that the library should be a kid friendly place. In order to make that happen we need find a place for these materials or not have them at all. Libraries need to be somewhere were anyone can go: a college kid trying to prepare for a test, a young child wanting to discover @PERSON1, or a old man wanting to enjoy the peace and quiet. The distraction of offensive materials are not needed in a library.       Libraries are places to learn and explore the different sources that are inside. For young children it is the fairytale land where anything is possible and the unimaginable can become true. If there are materials that adults do not want their children to see, they @MONTH1 not be comfortable having their child there. Libraries need to be kid friendly places, so that all the ages can enjoy what it has to offer.       As you can see, offensive materials should not be in libraries. All ages should be able to enjoy what a library has to offer, and with some materials that is not possible. Please consider the following.      Kind regards,         @PERSON2"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3369	2	"All kid's have their own style of books, @CAPS1 people like scary, funny, or romance books, but can we really take that to an offense? We should think of how taking @CAPS1 books off the shelf would affect more then one person, @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 be mature enough to read the more 'grown up' books or magazines, libraries have all types of syles for different people, you just might have to look a little harder to find the right book for you.         I do not agree that @CAPS1 books and or magazines can be taken offensive. All libraries are different  types of books,for example  an elemantry school library they will not have grown up or teenager books, and a middle school will not have little kid books. We also have to think does peer presure effect what books or magaiznes kids read? , for example when I was in middle school my friends were all reading romance books, and I was still reading @ORGANIZATION1, and I had to change my reading style to fit in, so that's exactly what I did.      Books that have offensive content shouldn't be taken off the shelf, I believe that if there is 'offensive' books in your library, just ignore them you @CAPS2't have to get that book, we cant just take the more grown up books out because @CAPS1 kids @CAPS2't know what their suppose to be reading. Libraries have all different style of books to fit everyone's taste, so just look for that right book that suites you, and @CAPS2't take all the books that have an offensive style of the shelf, @CAPS2't judge a book by it's cover"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3376	2	"Materials should not be removed from libraries. It should be left up to a person to decided what the see or view. Books, music, movies, etc., are materials used by everyone and for some a library provide a haven where the can get there hands on such things only and no where else, so shouldn't try to take away any of these things from any body.     One reason why certain materials should not be removed from libraries shelfs is that there will always be some subjects, and materials that a great many people will argue shouldn't be seen, and there will always be other people who feels differently. And if we allow them to be taken away you will only be taking away a person own choice, which is something we all should strieve not to do. Also just who would be left to decide what material should be removed and what material shouldn't? Is there really one person who could make a such a choice for everyone? Also there is no way everyone could agree on what material should be removed, so by trying you would just be providing something more for everyone to argue on. I believe that if not everyone can be satisfied then why bother.     Another reason why in libraries certain materials shouldn't be removed is that by removing certain materials you would be interfering with education. Books, movies and other such things are used for learning even weather people realize it or not, and the more oppuntunties a person has to learn the better. And who are we to decide what a person decides to educate themselves about? There has infact been times in history when people in charge have wrongly decide that the public should not be educate or know about certain things and it was wrong then and it would be even more wrong now in our modern society. A society that is based on learning and knowledge, a socity that in situration should not hinder a persons ability to learn.     Also I realize some people @MONTH1 argue that for young children some materials are better left unviewed, but that's is where parents come in. It's there resoponsibility to decide what their children read or see and not anyone elses. And so there is no reason why anyone should interfere with a parents choice as long as it is in aggrement with the law.      These are the reasons why I think libraries shouldn't be allowed to decided what materials and subjects are put on their shelfs. For some dicsion no one can make to satify everyone and to be in the right. Therefore it is better that such things are left up to the person themselves."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3383	2	"For many students it is hard to compose essay's in a public school's library. Aquiring the neccisary information is comparable to finding a needle in a haystack. This is not due to the lack of funding or even the quality of teachers and staff. No neither of these problems is the cause behind many student's inabiltiy to compose thought provoking essay and analysis over a myrad of topics. This is due to the extremes in censorship that are being placed on libraries and schools in general. Many of the relevent topics and materials need to truely understand our constantly changing world is being removed from the grasp of those who will go on to lead this new world.Some prime examples of this tyrany on knowledge is the removal of books suck as @PERSON1, @PERSON2, the @CAPS1, and many other classical works. Each of these according to many parents has good reason to be removed from our libraries. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 promotes discrimination and racial supremacy along with being written by what @CAPS3 has pegged as one of the humanity's most vile of creatures. @PERSON2 uses racial surrs that are not appropriate to be in the hands of our young children. The @CAPS1 violates the separation of church and state. Many other classical works refference racism, drugs, murder, sex and use rampant profanity. All of these are valid reasons as to why a parent @MONTH1 advocate for there to be censorship of our libraries.These reasons, as well meaning as they @MONTH1 be, are no longer good enough to be valid in todays changing environment. Many of the books that have been recomneded to be removed show us an unfiltered view of a time period from a point of view that did not belong to the 'victor' of the social battle. As we know, '@CAPS3 is written by the victors.' @CAPS4 it is good that the @CAPS5 won the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and helped abolish slavery it is still important to realize that we still cannot remove the view point from our centers of knowledge. To forget is to remember at another time. That time is when we repeat the same mistakes again.For the parents who also want to save the innocence of their children by forbidding these books from libraries need to realize that the media has been pumping these forbiden images to their children more than books have. To censor our libraries is to cripple our children from the knowledge they need to fully understand our shadowed and fragmented world.

But we should also think about what we are doing and saying and if something is wrong or harms someone. we should take rightfull ownership to our mistakes.But I do agree that some books should be taken off the shelves if they provide thoughts our ideas to cause downfall to our country. such as terrorist groups drug and alachol books should be taken off so we do not pullute the minds of our youth. Our youth today is very influenced by the music we listen to the books we read and the television we watch.

3391	2	"'@CAPS1'@CAPS2 say that word!' That is exactly what I said to my brother after he had read the front cover of a magazine in the library one afternoon. Personally, I am an advocate of not saying curse words. Yet, my brothers are influenced by things, such as the media, to say them. Should we allow the media to sprinkle words like this on to magizine's and books? Or should the items containing these things be removed from the library's shelfing units?     Magazine's are one of many ways that we get the latest gossip on the most interesting scandals. They also appeal to a lot of people across the world. Most of those people are @DATE1 of age. Library's will most often place the magazine's on the shelf so that they can rake in some adult costumers. Most of  the content of the magazine's are pictures of half dressed women or men and explict lanuage on the covers these days. Should that be the new normal? I @CAPS1'@CAPS2 think so.     I enjoy reading. I personally think that reading is better @DATE1 sitting on the couch and watching mind numbing @CAPS2.V. But, the material of some books have gotten to be where every other word is a curse word. Or they contain degrading scenes that no one should have to read. It used to be that books were read to learn something new, or to open your mind to a new culture or piece of information. In these times, though, it seems ardous to come across a good book that is like the classics. As though day by day, we are replacing the magestic words of authors for common words that anyone can use. Replacing such books like these on the shelves for anyone to read isn'@CAPS2 right. It shouldn'@CAPS2 even be allowed.     With electronic devices such as the @NUM1 player and so on, most of the music comes from online sites where you purchase the song directly. Most parents @CAPS1'@CAPS2 know half the songs that the children buy, expecially when they @CAPS1'@CAPS2 buy it at home. With internet in many libraries kids can plug in their device and buy songs with offensive lanuage or graphic material without anyone knowing. Why @CAPS1'@CAPS2 the librarians put restrictions on the sites? The answer is that they can'@CAPS2. And, even if they did children would find a way to get around the restrictions. So, personally I think that they should remove the avaliablity of being able to download and purchase music at the library.Or take out the aweful lanuage all together in songs. Because the lanuage that they use is not needed.     Although times are constantly changing and things are different then they used to be, with a little help we can restore it to where it used to be. Kids using such foul lanuage is an issue that needs to be taken seriously. From my own experiences I know that it is a growing problem. But, maybe if we put censorship in libraries then some or most of the problems can disappear. From magazine articles, books, and even songs explict lanuage and graphic scenes are almost everywhere. So, speak up and talk to someone about the idea. It might just start a revolution"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3394	2	"What is appropriate in libraries these days? The opinions differ throughout the variety of different people across @LOCATION1.  Censorship has taken a turn in public libraries, but still has been strictly forbidden from school libraries. Personally, I think that there is a difference between vulger and inappropriate items in a public library versus a school library.      A public library is a place for anyone and anywhere to come and find an item that they are interested in. As we all know, everyone is different and have their own interests, so they should be able to find the book, music, etc. for them. The problem is, how do the libraries keep these uncensored objects out of children's hands? The answer should be simple. For thought, maybe all public libraries should be broken up into sections, each with their own subject matter. These different sections could include Children's, @CAPS1, and many more different titles. This set up is often used in well known book stores and libraries such as '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' and '@CAPS4'.  Overall, censorship in public libraries does not need to be as strict as school libraries.     School libraries are a whole different idea. School libraries are made to help assist the students' academic acheivement, nothing more and nothing less. However, I also think that the content in the school libraries also depends on the maturity of the students. For example, elementary and middle school libraries should have a stricter censorship than high school libraries. The students in high school should be mature enough to handle uncensored material without creating a huge scene, like we all know younger students would do. I have personally seen and witnessed a few so called 'inappropriate' books on the shelf at my high school library, but the readers of the book have been mature about reading it. I believe that some offensive and vulger items can be interesting and educational. It is all a part of growing up.          The censorship in our libraries today vary from each library to the next. School libraries and public libraries are completely different places of literate and media content. I think that it is a person's own personal decision dealing with which library they go to. If a family with young children want to go to the library, the parents need to choose the appropriate areas in the building to search for the children. Therefore, there should be no problem in running across a 'bad' book. The author, @PERSON1, states, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf... And then we have no books left on the shelf for anyone."	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
3395	2	"The Author should be the judge on whether or not they want there book censored. I believe that libraries shouldnt have to take out books with offensive language. If the author likes how it was originally made, then thats how they would like to present it. It would be taking away a Right in the @CAPS1. If you were to write a book and somebody says you cant put a certain word. That isnt up to the public to make a decision.         Its almost like rewriting history. It would be like having someone take out a word in the @ORGANIZATION1. If any word is changed it is a incorrect @ORGANIZATION1. It just changes the entire subject. You cannot reword whats been written.     Public views are starting to take over the world. Instead of letting the facts be the facts people want to adjust things so it is less offensive. Next thing you know there will be a replaced word for slavery. Slavery is a strong, bold word that represents a horrible thing. If somebody switched that word it could lead to it happening again. I say with all my heart that people need to respect what has been written and leave it that way or dont read it"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3398	2	"Do you feel that some material should just not be allowed in libraries? Censorship in libraries are a touchy subject. Many people with young children believe that some books should just not be allowed in the libraries, while others believe that because it is a book, no matter what, it should be allowed to be in the library. Who knows, someone @MONTH1 need to write a paper over that certain 'touchy' book. I think, personally, that as long as the book is in a proper section, it sould be okay for a person, of the right age, to be able to get that book or other material.     The libraries should have a certain area for children's books and another area for adult or teenage level reading or material. This way, there is a less likely hood that a young child will end up getting a book with material for an adult or teenager. The library in the town that I live in has a clearly marked area for children and teenagers. This way, young children are not going to be looking for their favorite book with a book over something many adults should not even be reading.     If people are concerned about someone being to young to read or view the material, the library can also put an age restriciton on the material. This way anyone who is under the age limit will not be able to get the material. The people who are of proper age will be able to get the material, however.      Libraries are very important sources for studing in many people's lives. If people did not have a library, they @MONTH1 not be able to research a paper, or something else, that they need to get finished. I feel if people do not like the material that they see in their local library, then they should just not look at it or borrow the material from the library. I do feel, however, that little children should not be given even the slightest chance to stuble upon a book with disturbing material. There, in my opinion, needs to be a room with said materials that children have, in no way, access to. This way, children are not able to access the material, but they are still able to go into the library without their parents feeling that the children @MONTH1 see something unsuitable for them.     I feel that those people who love reading should be able to go into a library, and not be afraid of if they are going to see a book containing material they believe to be unsuitable. I also feel that if I need to research something that is deemed, by others, to be offensive, I should somehow be able to research my subject. Also, if I was the author of a book that was said to be 'bad,' i would not want my book to be taken away, so that no one could read it, or study and learn from it.      I do not think that censorship is something that people should take lightly. We all have the freedom of speech, so why not let the authors of the materials have that same freedom. There are procautions that parents and people who do not want to see this literature can take. Total censorship, I feel, would not allow for people to broaden their minds. If people just take procautions, there is no need for total censorship of materials, that someone worked very hard on for everyone to see"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3401	2	"I do not think books , music, movies, magazines etc... should be removed because they are offensive. There are books movies and music that offend everyone if we took them all away we would have nothing. Theres no reason for all that. Thats why i say we do not take away offensive materials.     First, if we took away all the offensive materials off the shelves they would be empty. As well as the library, the movie store and everything else. If something like a book or movie offends you i feel bad for you anyways, but just put it down and dont wory about it.      Second, i dont think we should remove offenssive materials off the shelves because of what they mean to us. They show us the good and bad the right and wrong, thats what books are for. Books are important to this world as well as movies and magazines and such. But to some more than others. You cant get mad at a book or a movie so just learn from them.     For instance, say we did take away all the offensive materials what is that going to do? Is it going to make the word a beteter place? I dont think so. I think we need stuff like that on earth to show and to teach us the way to be. To educate and informate.     In conclusion, i do not think offensive materials should be remove. We would have nothing and the libraries, movie stores and books would be empty. We would also be pretty missinformed about life. So we should not remove offensive materials off the shelves"	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
3409	2	"Should books, music and movies be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Books, music and movies have a certain veiw set aside for the reader or veiwer at hand. If someone has a different veiw of the text then they should not even be reading or veiwing them but to have books that are great be taken off of the shelves because they represent different veiws to someone else is unreasonable. People should give these things a chance because sometimes the non-original things just don't work. To have movies band from the public because they are offencive is something that is something that is just a way to control what we see and what we here. Books, music and movies should not be taken from shelves for the fact that they teach us a lesson about life without it really happening to someone.     Books are a way that people can express themselves with out actually going out and hurting someone or something. Poetry for example gives the reader a feeling of what the writer was feeling when it was produced. Books that have political or social veiws on something should not be discriminated because someone does not like the side that they chose or the way that the author presents it to the the people. In novels just because someone uses profainty does not mean that there message is any less clear. Their message @MONTH1 be that profanity is used to offten or that the way that the next generation below them my turn for the worst but it is not used to harm.      Music is a way that people can express their emotions without taking it out on the people that have hurt them or the people that they have hurt themselves. When someone uses profanity in a song it is not specifically said at one person; it is used to say how bad they feel about what has happened to them that they need something to really show how they feel. Many people who hear these lyrics sang to them @MONTH1 beleive that the person is telling them that that really is how they feel when its just a verse. Music should not be taken away because it is just words and they should not hurt someone, especially when it is only a way to express.      In movies you see someone get shot, bruitlly murderd or attacked and its already a horrible thing because someone died or because someone did not have a fair life. This violance shown on the screens in homes, movie theaters and schools is shown to teach people what dangers are really out there; they are not shown to teach people other ways to severly injure another person although that is how people perseive them. Movies are about taking an idea and showing the world your idea; to show the world that this is what you are thinking and that this is how you feel about something.      To have this all taken away shows that the generations before us are scared of what it is that we can do when we are a whole or what we can be if we stand alone and say that we don't like something.  Books, music and movies that are all based on something that is real should not be banded just because they show individuallity; just because they have the deacensy to show us the truth in all the lies told to us but a higher person. These people most likely beleive that there is a thing as a perfect life when there is not one so when people show the way that things are they get scared that their ideas of a perfect thing are ruined by those who know the truth. The censorship of only things that are truely vile should be censored not the things that have nothing to do with the way that the comunities are today."	3	4		3	3	4	3																		
3416	2	"I think that there are some books out there that really do need to be taken on the library shelves and just be put in book stores for ones own useage. Then there are other books that people just need to be more mature about like history books talking about wars, slavrey and books with curse words in them.      School libraries such as the elementry and high school should have books according to their age groups. If the libririan knows the book is not something a young kid should read then they shouldnt let them check it out. The music,magazines and movies should also be age appropiate for the age groups too little children do not need to hear cuss words every five seconds in a song.      Movies should be age appropiate too. Thats why libraries have sections for babys,toddlers,pre teens, teens and adults so if your really concerned that your child or even just your self are gonna find a offensive book or one thats not good for the age group then stay ing your own section. Lets say your a teen and theres a book that is not right for you too read and is for more older people then you should be able to tell a librarian that is there and maybe she can just move it out of that section.          Every person feels differently about whats offensive and not  offensive though so libraries shouldnt have to take out every book that offends one person cause it's not fair to the rest of the people. Besides no ones making you check out that book"	3	3		3	3	4	3																		
3418	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,     I strongly agree that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are young chirlderen that will pick up a book, movie and/or @CAPS3 case, or even a magazine and read off whatever the front says. We @CAPS5't need younger childeren reading off whatever they know what to say. @CAPS7's already bad enough that they hear @CAPS7 from family members or @CAPS2 near them. The seller could also make an edited verison of the book, movie, @CAPS3, or magazine.      The sayings,'You @CAPS5't like @CAPS7, than @CAPS5't look.','@CAPS5't got anything nice to say, than @CAPS5't say anything at all.',and 'If you wouldn't want to hear @CAPS7, than @CAPS5't say @CAPS7.',strongly apply to this. The way this world is coming to, @CAPS7 seems like they @CAPS5't really mind who sees their product, as long as @CAPS2 are buying their product.     Now a days, @CAPS7 seems like the younger the child is, the smarter @CAPS7'll be. If a four-year-old picked up a @PERSON1 @CAPS3 case, saw a pretty much naked grown adult on the case doesn't put a good thought in their head. That child's gonna grow thinking, '@CAPS7's okay to be naked. @PERSON1 did @CAPS7. Why can't I?'. Childeren learn more things from family and freiends, before they start learning the truth in school.        @CAPS7's just like you wouldn't want to take your child to the @CAPS8 @CAPS9, half naked to naked woman just walking around freely. Not something a little five-year-old needs to see. Just like a little five-year-old doesn't need to hear cussing or using the @CAPS10 name in vien.     Having young childeren see, hear, say, think, or read things like that puts thoughts in their heads, making them think @CAPS7's okay to say whatever you want or to dress however they want, while they think @CAPS7's perfectly natural. Although, this @MONTH1 seem like a huge wake up call to some parents, but @CAPS7's not normal. @CAPS7's not more normal than telling your kids that they were a mistake. Things like that shouldn't be said to/ near childeren.      Every parent wants the best for their child, they @CAPS5't want their childeren growing up in world that is full of bad nor do they want their childeren doing wrong. By letting companies sell their prodcut with half naked @CAPS2 on the front cover of a magazine or @CAPS3 case, or by selling books that talk about murding someone, hiding the body, and prays to @CAPS12 that they @CAPS5't get caught, or by playing music that is offensive in stores with younger kids, let's them think that they can sell whatever they want, promote their music where ever they want, makes the companies win.      I'm not a mother, nor am I soon-to-be-a-mother, but I find @CAPS7 highly offensive that companies and stores would do that. i wouldn't want my child looking at a magazine than asking me questions about the @CAPS2 nearly naked, or have them ask me what a word means when @CAPS7's a cuss word. I certainly wouldn't buy a book that just looks strange or offensive to my child.      As well, I strongly do believe in '@CAPS13 of @CAPS14', so the companies, in a way, do have a right to sell their product how @CAPS7 is. Just, if they really wanted to selll their product that much, that bad, than they should sell @CAPS7 online. @CAPS7 @MONTH1 cost more, but at least everyone would know that their childeren wouldn't see @CAPS7. Although, once you owned @CAPS7, than @CAPS7's the buyers fault if their child saw @CAPS7. That would be on the parents plate to deal with.      Another thing with childeren, is that their brain is still developmenting at that young age, their imagintion is beyond fairy tale world, @CAPS7's kinda like their second home, only @CAPS7's inside their brain. Their brain is still developmenting and learning new things each and everyday. Once they go to the store with their parent (s), they're already jumping up and down off the walls for a new toy or a new pair of shoses, or just because they wanna run up and down the alies, @CAPS7's bad enough having them see something inopporty.      I know I wouldn't let my childeren see things like those and I'm about @PERCENT1 certain you wouldn't want your childeren seeing those things. So, for the childeren's sake, think of them, their minds, and their developmenting brains and their off the wall imagaintion. Treat the childeren how you were treated growing up.                                   Thank You,                                   @PERSON2"	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
3422	2	I find it intresting that people think that its there problem to go to the book self and say this and that shouldnt be aloud here. I also feel thats if you dont like the book dont look at it. Or read it. I mean I kind of understand about the magazines becouse somethimes there can be pretty bad. I mean at the same time its noones job to say what is right and what is wrong.                   The music I am @PERCENT1 with it being taken out of the libraries. some of the music people lisson to today is just not right or kids or adults. People are wanting to know why there is so much killing and hate in the world today. The movies at the libraries are pretty good they dont let thim get to bad i cant compain to much about that.        All around the libraries are doing a good job with how they handle it. Just some stuff that I would change but really what I think doesnt matter. Im only a @NUM1 year old kid i mean I can give my thoghts about it but thats about it. I love the libraries nothing will ever stop me from going. If I dont like something thin i just dont read it or look at it and thats how everyone should be	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
3428	2	"First comes censorship along with its totalitarian prowess, second comes the downfall of humanity. We have all seen the horrors of totalitarianism over time. From the @CAPS1 regime of @LOCATION1 to the banning of @CAPS2 in the @CAPS3 empire. It always is a terror that falls violently.     Farenheit @NUM1 was written by @PERSON1 in the mid twentieth century, forshadowing a wicked future if censorship is brought to humanity. The human populaion will no longer have actual knowledge, only what they have been told. In this book, the population is forbidden from having any kind of book. Their history is completely makeshifted by the government into a psychological madness. As if propaganda doesn't warp the minds of people enough, censorship of books would be the end.     Man must know his foundation and where he comes from. All it takes is one little book to be taken of the shelf. Eventually they all will start coming down til there are none. The government will erase history as it is and create one that warps the minds of all to believe the goverment is righteous. When the malignant being is the government itself.     This all brings up one of the worlds greatest questions. What actually should be kept out of viewing for all to see? We all think it is correct to keep pornographic material and adult language away from children. What is it that actually made these things intolerable in the first place? We have been taught our whole lifes that these things are, but when real censorship comes in, so does the apocalypse of all knowledge. People believe anything they are told as long as enough people are saying it.     I, without slight hesitation, stand against censorship in every way. People have the right to know everything. Parents still have the ability to keep things they see as unacceptable from their children as much as they please to do so. Let man choose what is intolerable to him. Censorship goes against everything the western democracies stand for. All freedoms are taken away by that one word. The democracies feared communism due to its totalitarian government. The communists censored everything inside the @CAPS4 @CAPS5.     History has shown us time and time again that totalitarianism is unsuccessful. The people must be free and must be able to live their own lifes. Only then will they defend their countries so they can preserve freedom. Both world wars resulted in totalitarian regimes beeing taken down by the free, uncensored men of the democracies.     A word is simply a word. People will always have their own views on everything. Arguments about every little thing will always be at hand. We all must understand that although we all have differences in our beliefs, we must prevent censorship and accept all. The day we dont, censorship will come, and noone will have the right to believe in what they want. It is humanity's decision and it must be made at this time when the world is at its greatest. What will become of the uncertain future?"	6	4		6	4	4	4																		
3429	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,          I think that if a book is on a shelf the book should be taken off if found offensive. People at libraries fight over a book. They need to have more than one copy of a book if they fight over one book. If the library dosen't have more than one copy of a book it will create a lot of prolums for everyone.          People in library fight over a sigle book. I think who ever gets there first should get the book, but that just me. If two people fight over a book they should be kicked out of the library and never come back to the library. And that is why we have fights over a book. The next time you are in a library think frist before you act. Ask yourself '@CAPS3 they get ther before me?'.          The library should have more that one copy of a book. Lets say '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1' book sreies is in the library and thay have one of each book. Now the lat move of '@ORGANIZATION1' is coming out this @DATE2 (@DATE1) and people what the last book to read. The kids what it, but there is one book. So what do you do? Get more copies of the book. This is why libraries should have more than one copy.          If the libraries don't have more than one copy of a book it will create a lot of prolums. If they have one copy of a book it will begin fights. You don't what to fight in a library (look @CAPS4 @NUM1). Now if it was me, I will let someone have it that whan it. So, libraries need more than one copy.     In conclusion I think that if a book is on a shelf, the book should be taken off if found offensive. There fighting for a book and you don't whant that. The libraries needs more than one copy of a book, so they will not fight over it. If the libraries don't have copies of a book it will create prolums. So, think before yo act. It can be found offensive at time.                                                                           Sincesly,                                                                         @PERSON1"	2	3		2	2	3	2

Because they can scar a kids mind forever, so in my opinion any books with thatstuff in the book should not be on the self for any public library. Also we should have more sensory in books with inaproprite speaking because it can give a person a change in thought.Also let me give you a example,lets say a little boy asks were the action books are, the libarien would say well aren't you a little too young to be reading this books an the child would say no but I heard this was a really good book an my big brother said it a good book too. And in my opinion that is all I need to say.Sincerly your customer @PERSON2."	2	2		2	3	3	3																		
3436	2	"I think that books, music, movies, and magazines should not have to be removed from shelves of libraries. People find entertainment to movies with sexual or violent activity in them. I believe that if we do take all of the stuff that involve offensive things off shelves then some people will be upset.     In our generation today, people look forward to see things that they can't see at home with their parents. Music these days have a lot of bad language in them, but that's what makes people interested in them. The same with movies. Books, music, and movies today talk a lot about sexual intercourse, illegal drugs, and criminal involvement. This kind of stuff gets our attention, and makes us interested.     If you have a child or someone in the family that you don't want them to watch, listen, or read about offensive stuff then don't let them see it. Most stores with offensive stuff have a back room where they keep all of it, so they don't have to worry about others seeing it. People do take it offensive sometimes but that doesn't mean that libraries should have to take them off their shelves.     People can make there own decision of what they want to listen, watch, or read. Everybody can choose what they prefeir. Everybody has their own opion on things. I think that libraries will have more business with the offensive things then without. Younger people find more interest in the things that seeem like a dream, or things that seem so unreal.      I think that they should keep offensive music, books, movies, and magazines out on shelves, because we have our own freedom to do what we want. Lots of people find many pleasures to watching offensive things. If you don't want to see or listen to stuff you don't prefer then don't look for them at the libraries"	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
3439	2	"I think that most books, magazines or any kind of reading material that has offensive stuff to people are ok. Many people needs to read them and see what they are about. I think people take little things such as, curse words, or if the book or magizine is talking about drugs people take offensve.          I don't think there is one book out there that doesn't have a curse word in it. Many people complain about small things like that when the reading material could be a lot worse than it is. I have read many books that have inappropriate words in them.     I had a situation once when the title of the book sounded great and when I started reading it it had a lot of curse words in it. I guess thats just how it is now a days. You honestly cannot find a book without atleast one bad word in it. People just need to learn to get over the fact that many offensive things are found in many different reading materials.     I do not think that the books, music, movie, magizines etc. should be removed from the shelves. It could be interesting to someone else but not you. Many people have different oppinions about different kinds of things and I think it should just be left up to that person weather or not they read, listen or even look at certain kind of reading material."	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
3443	2	"Censorship or not? That is the question. Many people @MONTH1 not realize it, but what they read and watch greatly affects them. If children watch a scary movie, then nightmares seem to occur more often. If teens read a book where parties seem cool and bad  things are glorified, they too start to see bad as good. What if @CAPS2 article you are reading right now contained offensive language and inappropriate ideas? Most people would be offended and complain. I fyou saw an old man walking down the street yelling out obtrusive things, you would be mad and tell him to quit. So then the question is arised, why is it alright for us to watch movies like @CAPS2? Yes, books and movies should be censored.     Children are very naive at a young age. When a child starts getting exposed to violence, illegal acts, alcohol and drugs in books or movies, they start to think it's okay. For instance, when I was younger, I watched the movie '@CAPS1.' @CAPS2 movie contains a profanity every other word, so it seems. I saw my favorite actors on @CAPS2 movie saying bad words, so I figured it was alright. It's not okay for a child to talk offensively like that. One day I even heard a little @LOCATION2 quoting lines from the '@CAPS3.' @CAPS2 movie is hilarious but extremely suggestive. It made me sad to hear an innocent little @LOCATION2 talking about things that are way over his head.      Teenagers that listen to music from @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2 are getting bad messages. Although these two rappers are seen as modern day music heroes, they shouldn't be glorified the way they are. They're songs are all about smoking weed and getting high. They make it seem cool. So teenagers think, '@CAPS5 if they can do it, so can I!' They start to engage in activities that were once frowned upon. If teenagers were't exposed to @CAPS2 kind of music, they wouldn't be as apt to take part in such things.      As for adults, their movies and books should be censored too. One @MONTH1 think that once they're older they can do waht they want, but that's not the case. Let me throw out an example to you. Let's just say a husband and wife are watching a movie together. It's great until a rather, inappropriate ,shall we say, scene comes on. Not only does it make things awkward, but it sends out the wrong message. When adults or unmarried people see their favorite actors being naughty on television, it makes it seem right. They start to lose the concept that you are supposed to remain abstinant until marriage. After all, it is the only way to remain free of any diseases.      If movies, books, magazines, and music continue to be left uncensored, the world will become a giant brouhaha. People will begin to lose the sense of what is right and what is wrong. We are on the brink of violence and total chaos. If we contiue to let our children and ourselves watch these types of movies and whatnot,things will get ugly. Yes, if libraries or stores find anything offensive on their racks, then they need to censor it before it corrupts any more minds"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3446	2	"The quote that Katherine Paterson declairs a very strong point and is completely true in my eyes. Everyone thinks and functions differently so therefore something offensive to one person might be completely fair and good in anothers point of view.     Everybody thinks different and as you go to school or work everyday you find that obvious by just about anything the person is doing or owns. For instance, their clothing. Belongings can show a lot about a person just as much as actions or words. So what do you think? Do you think that any material from the library should be taken off the shelf just because someone or a couple of people think its offensive or terrible? In my opinion, no. Every book, magazine or anything in the media can send out a different message in everyones personal thoughts. For example, one movie could touch someone in a very special way and at the same time, someone right next to them could think it's disguisting and cruel. I have actually had a real life situation were this has been a conflict.     During the years of my seventh grade experience there was this playstation game that i loved to play and enjoyed playing every single day with all of my friends. My mother, and pretty much the entire @LOCATION1 found it very offensive. It was really awkward and annoying that one of the things i loved is something that they tried to ban and not allow it to be sold from local stores. Now being in my shoes how do you think that felt for me? I thought it didn't feel very fair at all, it's selfish and inconsiderate. That's like taking somebody possessions and telling them your opinion on them and then ditching them into the trash to rote and vanish forever.      I believe that you should be able to read anything you would like in the library without the fear of your next favorite book being taking off of the shelf because a group of people protest from the language or whatever they think is offensive to them in the novel, because the next time you know it, everything will be gone from the shelves since everyone has different opinions. If you dont like the novel, then i assist you to return it, and to never read it again. I feel this conclusion is very fair and considerable. So what do you think as readers, is it fair to be able to read whatever you want or do you think if you or someone finds it offensive, you can take it off of the shelves?"	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
3447	2	"Throughout the world, there are thousands of people with various opinions. If one person thinks an art piece looks unique, another @MONTH1 not see any true beauty. But when people hardly underdstand the concept of other people, they should not be exposed to books or movies that could be defined as offensive. Some people don't know @CAPS2 it is like to be truely offended.       When I was in middle school, I was a shy, fragile, young girl. I had just moved to a new school and was petrified of my new surroundings. For the first couple of weeks, I felt like an outcast; like an outsider looking in. I didn't fit in with anyones' group. Everyone seemed to of already have friends for years and here I was, a new student with no friends to communicate with. I was isolated and was desperately trying to find someone to be my friend. I wondered if something was wrong with me; if I has a bad odor or was dressed in an out of style fashion. I tried buying new clothes and changing my hair color. It seemed as if I wasn't even noticed. Before I new it, school was half way over. I was still a nobody. Then @PERSON1 came along and made me a somebody.     @PERSON1, who had just moved to my school, looked bold and confident. At first, people waved a friendly hello but nothing more. As I sat at my empty lunch table, @PERSON1 approached me and asked to sit down. I couldn't refuse the offer so I nodded a sincere yes. The entire lunch period, we sat talking. We had a lot in common and I was glad to have made a friendship with @PERSON1. Months went by before I realized @PERSON1 and I were great friends. I knew I could trust him with all of my secrets. Even though @PERSON1 and I were close, I felt as though @CAPS3 was always hiding something. Occasionally I would have enough courage to ask if there was anything @CAPS3 needed to tell me, but as the same as every answer before, it was a no.      @PERSON1 and I had always walked to my house after school. But on one afternoon, something felt wrong. The air seemed to lingere for miles. We didn't talk until we got inside my house. Suddenly @PERSON1 spoke and said, '@CAPS1 are people so cruel?' I was shocked by this question for I didn't know how to respond. @PERSON1 sensed that I had no clue @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was talking about so @CAPS3 continued. 'I'm gay.' I was appalled. Not because @CAPS3 was gay, but because @CAPS3 had never told me. I asked, '@CAPS2 happened?' @CAPS3 sat on the couch then and told me about how @CAPS3 was in the library overhearing some of our classmates reading a book about people making fun of gays'. I felt awful for @PERSON1. It wasn't his fault @CAPS3 was gay.     I believe that certain books, movies, or music that are offensive to people should not be aloud on shelves. Some have never been offended. Some, always offend people for many reasons. Everyone has feelings and it hurts when they are offended. We, as a community, should love one another and respect them. Not read or listen to things that can hurt someones' inner feelings"	4	3		4	4	4	4																		
3448	2	"Dear Newspaper,     I do indeed believe that certain books, magazines or any other form of redaing material should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive. I say this because, in every situation, either one side benefits, both sides benefit, or neither side benefits. If you do not want that article or piece of writing to be seen by certain audiences, then do not put it on a public display.      It is best that they are in a solitare area for audiences mature enough to handle the influence and/ or consequences that go along with that type of material. I say influence, because studies and personal views have shown that teens and even young children are often influenced by explicit views portrayed by media. These children act in ways that reflect what they have seen. If they watch a movie full of violence, they @MONTH1 feel it is their job to act in violent manners. Until they reach an age of maturity and responsibility to make their own decisions, they let the outside world decide what is best.     As a child is grows up, they are obligated to follow certain rules or take authoritative matters seriously. Authority teaches us, as children. We develop through our teachings and grow through our surroundings. You @MONTH1 ask what it is i am speaking about. Well, i believe that this situation relates to the phrase 'think before you speak' because it seems that the people displaying this media don't think about the after affects of their actions.     Suggest that certain material @MONTH1 not only be impacting children and teens, but adults are highly affected as well. I am not speaking as though everyone who watches a movie or reads a book about a murderer will go out killing people. I am only saying that our surroundings almost make us who we are along with the way we were raised. The media gives us insight and ideas, in which sometimes revole around our every thought.      I do believe that certain media, should be displayed in confidential locations. If not, then it should be a recommendation and obligation to have an age limit. My concern for public media display pertains to the concern of the impact on human lives. Thank you for your time.                              Sincerely,                 @LOCATION1"	3	4		3	3	4	3

Three of the best books I have read through my high school career were about drugs, rape, partying, and had innepropriate language in them.      Some parents would not like their children reading those books and would ask for them to be taken out of our school library, but I think that is completely wrong. We have  freedom of speech and press so why can't those books be in our school libraries? What some parents think are offensive, others might not. Most of the time children disagree with their parents anyways so they are going to read whatever they want to read, or watch what they want, or even listen to what they want.      People are different and we have a right to our own opinions. Some parents would say that those kinds of books should be taken out of the library but that's wrong, if you don't like them then don't read them, or discourage your kids from reading them. It's just a book, it's not like it's actually happening. Books are separated by age too, so a young child will be getting books from the children section so those books are for children and should be appropriate. Teenagers have a section too and they should be mature enough to handle what they read in books.      I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from our libraries because a select few people think their offensive, that takes books away from people who enjoy reading those kinds of books. Then if all kinds of people are saying everything is offensive there will be no more books left on the shelf for people who don't think their offensive.When I am an adult I will tell my children what I expect from them and let them make their own choices because no matter what they will anyways and if they want to read a book with bad language in it, or a movie with language then so be it. It's not like they're actually doing what's going on in the book. Overall I think it is completely wrong for books to be removed from libraries for people complaining about them being offensive"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3455	2	"Librarys have the right to diside how censored they want their material on their shelves to be. Much of this material @MONTH1 be considered offensive to certain people. However some materials @MONTH1 be as offensive to one perwson, it @MONTH1 not be offensive to another. Americans have freedom of speech, and writing, and many ohter rights. A library should have the right to put whatever materials it would like on to their shelves.      There will always be offensive songs, books, movies, and magazines. Howver, some materials @MONTH1 be found offensive to someone, it @MONTH1 not be found offensive to others. A library @MONTH1 not be able to please everyone. 'But if they have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work i abhor- then they also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And we have no books on the shelf for any of us' (Paterson). Paterson is simply explaining that if somone finds somthing offensive and wants it removed from a shelf then soon all books will be removed, and there will be nothing left at all on the shelves.      A library is a place for everyone to come and find what they are looking for without any disterbances. A person probably isnt looking for somthing offensive. Therefore coming accross somthing that is offensive @MONTH1 be disterbing; however they should be able to try to ignore it. It is that persons choice to choose that library to attend to. So they will choose to maybe find offensive materials. If somone does not wish to come across offensive material they should choose not to go to the library.     Americans have the right to be free, so does a library. If a person comes across a offinsive piece of material it should be ignored. A library can not please everyone by taking out all of it merchandice that @MONTH1 be considerd offensive. There simply would be nothin left. People should be aware that they @MONTH1 come across some offensive materials when going in to a library, so it will allways be the peoples choice of attending that library"	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
3463	2	"I think they should'nt remove material from libraries if it's found offensive. People find different things offensive that others do not. If you started takeing these things out,thers a good possibility that you'll loose everything,books and your people.      One example I say this is because, some people are offensive bout movies that have violent scense in them. Others like the violence in those shows. The librarie might be the only way someone can get ahold of something they like.      Another example is, magazines can contain material you don't want your kids round or seeing. That same magazine could help a student with a assignment at school. Kids might need the material that is offensive,it could help them through life.       In conclusion I do not think we should take movies and books out if someone finds it offnesive. Some of the offensive material could be used to help students in there education. Other offensive material some adults enjoy reading or watching. Just because one person finds something offensive does not mean the next person that comes in will."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3467	2	"Censorship    'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other chldren have taken off the shef. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -that work I abhor -then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 was quoted from an author named Katherine Paterson. I don't believe certain materials such as books should be removed from shelves under any circumstances. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion about certain materials. If books are removed from the shelves due to censorship, than what is the point of writing or even reading books? If people continue to remove books because they're found to be offensive, then there won't be any books left to read.     I have seen many offensive books. Whether it had something to do with religious beliefs or even revealing too much sexual content, I'm sure it's offensive to someone somewhere. Books are written by authors who believe they have the right to express themselves through writing. If you are to take away or ban a certain book from the shelf, than what would the author who wrote the book think? @CAPS1 world is full of offensive and rather disturbing books. It can't be right to just get rid of those things because they bother us. Everyone has the right to read any book they want to. Just because it offends one person, doesn't mean it offends everyone.     I believe censorship is unnessesary. What gives anyone the right to remove or change something because it's inappropriate? I have personally read a few books that I wouldn't want little kids to read but that doesn't mean I should remove it from the shelves. Perhaps, somebody else has been waiting to find that book. If I did remove it than I'm restricting others from experiencing the joys of reading that book.      Censorship in general is wrong. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and different ways of expressing themselves. I don't believe anyone has the right to take something, that someone has worked on for so long to make, and remove it because they find it offensive. There will always be something out there that you won't approve of. Just because you don't approve of it doesn't mean everybody doesn't approve. Authors write books for a reason, musicians write music for a reason, people make movies and magazines for a reason. What gives anyone the right to take something that somebody made and ban it from the rest of the world because it's offensive?     Books are there to help us become more educated and more open minded towards different thoughts and ideas. We shouldn't just ban them because they offend certain people. If you don't like a book because it offends you, than don't read it. It's just that simple. If people continue to remove books because they're offensive, then there won't be any books left to read."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3475	2	"I as a student, a child and a citizen of of the united states believes that every book, should be allowed in any library.  Books, express feelings, emotions ect., the same thing with movies, music.  I we don't have them how will we be able to learn anything in this world. Each book out there has an explanation, a title and a reason to be read.  Today millions of poeple read more ad more because of all the books out there.            I do believe however the reason why every book should be in a library is because all of them are different.  It doesn't matter what the books about, some might seem offensive but everyone has something that they dislike.  There are many poeple out there that get deffensive over things, for example certain people, animals, countries, different skin colors, cursing and even sports.  We all have our own opinions, if you do not like a certain book because it has a content that you don't like then it's simple don't read it, others might like it.  Movies, books, music, magazines, etc., should be allowed anywhere"	2	3		2	3	3	3																		
3483	2	"In many libraries there are books, movies, magazines, and music that people find offensive. Some find them more offensive than others. I believe that just because someone finds these things offensive that they shouldn't be removed from the shelf. I believe this because other people @MONTH1 be interested in it, we need information from the resources in the libraries, and all books make people more intelligent.     These resources are in the library for a reason.If what is on the shelves is a distraction to people, they don't have to pay any attention to it. People can find what they like and stay away from what they do not like. For example, there are books that talk about real things that happen to real people in real life and some @MONTH1 not be able to handle the descriptive details that are given; if it's not easy to handle then just put it back and go read something else. Everyone in this world is different and we all like different things.     In addition, some books in the library are used for informational text. College students, teachers, and students from all over the world need a library with these kinds of books, movies, music, and magazines. For example, they @MONTH1 need these rescources to help out with a class or presentation. If they were removed, they wouldn't have any way to find their information because it was found offensive.     Lastly, all books make people more intelligent. Sometimes things are abstruse and these books help explain them better.We learn something new everyday and we learn it from reading out of books. Not only books but magazines and movies help as well. Reading books help people to get stronger with their vocabulary and communication.For example, the people who read more than others are usually the ones who like to be involved in plays and don't have a problem with speaking in front of people. This is due to their intelligent reading levels. They are more likely to remember better than those who do not read and also have a bigger vocabulary.      So as you can see, people like different things and some are going to find these rescources offensive. Also, books are used to help people out and they make people more intelligent. If books, movies, and music were removed then we would not have a better intelligence than we do now. Every human being will have a problem some how and that is just what life is. Life comes with problems and we have to learn to deal with them. In fact, that is what we have to do when these problems come up because we all have a different outlook on everything but books being tooken off the shelves would not help anything; they can only help us out"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3486	2	I believe that in libraries certain materials should not be removed from the shelves even if it is offensive because if someone does not like that particular item they could always go and get another item. I have been to a library and nothing at all was offensive to me or anyone else. If you dont like that the library displays all the 'OFFENSIVE' items then you dont have to go it is an personal choice. Everyone has their own choice on what they listion to or read it doesnt matter as long as that particular person likes that sort of thing. That is what I believe in	1	1		1	3	3	3																		
3491	2	"I personally dont think there should be any censorship in books coming into a @CAPS1. I think its wrong to do so, because any book should be read know matter what is said in it. Anyone who has a problem with something should just not read it and leave it alone.      Now ive not really seen anything that i'd fine offensive, but ive read somethings with words i was sort of was suprised to see. But nothing that i found offensive personally. Books are there for their own purpose, and thats another reason why authors put them out there for the public to think what they want of it."	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
3493	2	"I think books that have nudity, curse words, or gang related violence should be put in either a adult shelf or taken off for good. They show kids stuff they shouldnt see or do when they get older. They just arent appropriate. No childeren should know about drugs, sex, or epspecially gang violence. Its stuff they should never even find out about. So i think we should take them books off the shelf, if people want to read them they can go buy themselves a copy."	2	2		2	2	3	2																		
3502	2	"Movies, books, music, magazines, and more all have there own way of expressing the content in them depending on what the author is talking about. If the author choses to write something that you do not nessisarly agree with or is offensive to you then do not read or watch that piece of material.     Everyone is intitled to there own opions. Theycan do and say what they want. Somethings those opions @MONTH1 have consequences involved but you still can write the material you want. As an author you provide a book to the public, If it gets that far. When a book is published then it is sent to a library that way you can choose to read if you would like. I book should not be taking off the shelf is someone finds that offensive. Someone else @MONTH1 not find it offensive and might actually enjoy that reading material. When a movie is made and it is '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or is offensive to someone then people just do not go and see that movie. They do not stop playing it because someone @MONTH1 having different feelings about the movie.     If you find a movie, magazine, or even a book offensive then do not read it or do not watch it. Someome else @MONTH1 enjoy something that you do not. Not everyone in the world today is going to agree on whats offensive and whats not. You can not always make everyone happy. If the book becomes a problem and it a majority amount of people that think it is offensive then yes maybe it should be talked about taking off of the shelf. If you think a book or movie is offensive then you have that right to not watch or read it. If someone else wants to read or watch the piece of material then they also have the right to do that. If something is offensive it is a personal choice to think so, so why take if off the shelf when they just do not have read it?"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3504	2	"I think they should remeove it if the publick thinks its offensive. I think it should be that way about every thing. If something is offending you then you should say something about it. Im not saying that it will be takin care of all the time but you might get lucky and someone might fix it so your not offened all the time.      Growing up at home dad would always tell me if I didn't like something then don't do it, unless it was somethin that had to be done then I would have to do it. So when something happens that I don't like, I either change my ways or I aviode whatever it is. I rairly change my ways though. Some times that is a bad thing though, but who hasn't mad a mistake or two?      This is really hard for me to right about beacuse I don't care what other people think. So I really don't get offened. I do know some people the get offened easy though. I try to stay away from them beacuse you have to watch what you say all the time. To me thats no fun, I mean come on dude you have to be able to take a joke. If more people were easy going then I wouldn't be writing this essa. I bet there would be a lot less droma to but I dont know.     If you know of a book, movie, anything that will or might offened you, just dont read it again. It might not offened the next reader. They might really like the book or whatever it is. All you have to do is stay away from what ever it is that is bothering you. After a wile you will forget about it. I guess if it really really bothered you, and there was a lot more people that felt the same way about the same thing then yes remove it. If there is only a hand full of people saying they are offened then I would just tell them sorry but more people like it better so it will stay."	4	4		4	3	3	3

I think that librarys shouldn't have certain books due to racism, violence, and etc. One, because there are young children that read books throughout the library, and two because books and magazines due to racism and ect. can be offensive to others.      How would you feel about your children reading about stuff like that? That's something a child doesn't need to know at an early age. So that's my perspective on it"	2	2		2	4	2	4																		
3520	2	"Censorship being as touchy a subject it is in my belief should be very rarely upheld, yes I believe there should be exceptions such as censoring materials in a childrens library or a childrens section of a bigger library, but to censor is to take ones freedom of speech, and expression away from them and is by my standards nothing more than unamerican.     Censorship acceptions should definetley be held in certain circumstances such as on a children's television network or a school library. Growing up my parents have not set any regulations for me regarding censorship, ever since I can remember I have been able to watch, read, and listen to anything I have ever wanted so my opinion is obviously going to slide toward uncensorship right? Wrong, although I do believe that nothing should be censored from the general public except for in special cases, I believe that it is the parents choice and full responsibility regarding their childrens censorship needs. I myself when I am a parent are going to censor my children away from what I seem unfit for their age whatever it @MONTH1 be.     The main reason that I am writing is to explain the moral issue that censorship is offering, yes the reason we consor is because we believe that the material is offensive or has ill moral, but these are the opinions and beliefs of the creators and being in a society that claims to be tolerant of one's beliefs we should respect the creator's beliefs even though it is not the belief of ourselves. To censor is to force an artist or in essence a creator to change they're very reflections of themselves, after all that is what a work of art is whether it be a painting, a musical piece, or a television show it shows a distinct look into the creators mind and beliefs to censor is to cut off or warp this communication between the audience and the creator thus violating the freedom of speech, and freedom of expression that our country holds so dear.     I call this a touchy subject because when there is childrens welfare involved it is always a touchy subject, to prevent children from being exposed to what their parents seem inapropriate I believe that we should retain a censorship in such places as childrens library or childrens television networks, but as a country we are putting too much responsibility and reliability on the hope that the government will censor what we seem unfit when in reality it should be the job and choice of the parents to censor what their children are exposed to. to solve this growing debate I believe the solution lies in the question, 'should we censor material' well yes and no I generally think that for every book, song, or creation that some seem unfit for society should be released as censored and uncensored, this would open up oppurtunities for children to read more advanced literature, will not take away from the personel expression of the creators, and will not deny the public what they are looking for because a censored material is a loss for the creator as well as the audience who enjoy it"	4	3		4	4	2	4																		
3523	2	"Does it ever come to mind when your child says they're going to the library to study, but in reality they could be going there to find books about murder, violence, or possibly helpful information. @DATE1 when searching through the library you never know what @CAPS3 will find on the shelves. Most of the topics of books, music, movies, or magazines are helpful. But there's always that one @CAPS2 that you don't want your child finding, or that one movie you just hope your child isn't watching! I strongly believe that the the types of topics like violence and murder should be taken off of the library shelves.      When going to the library parents should be able to trust that their child is actually going there to study, not to look up bad books, movies, or magazines. Too many books and movies are showing that relying on violence is a good thing. For example when children are searching for a good book they aren't looking for something boring, they're looking for something that catches their eye. Most of these books resulting to violence. The more kids read about this, the more they think violence is okay.      Also magazines like '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or '@CAPS3 @CAPS2' are now showing stories of drugs use, teen pregnancy, or death of famous @CAPS3. @DATE1 our world has been increasing in the drug use of teens and adults, also the pregnancy rate of teens has went up dramatically in the past few years. These two things are not okay. I personally believe the reason these two topics have went up is because kids are thinking it's fine since they're reading about it in the new magazines, or seeing it on a tv, or reading about it in a book.  Kids or teens are believing it's easy to have a child at such a young age, or using drugs is cool because all the hot famous @CAPS3 are using them, which is shown in the magazines and books. But what kids aren't understanding is that it's really not as easy or fun as the movies, books and magazines are making it sound.     What happened to the library's that had information that was actually helpful in school? I understand that @CAPS3 are wanting to read about famous @CAPS3 and what's new with them. But when all of these types of books, magazines, and movies are put into our libraries it is limiting the amount of actual helpful information kids need for school or adults are needing for work. When I was younger,  I would go to the library and I either went thier to study or to check out a good book. Not a book about violence, murder, or teen precnancy. Kids need to be able to rely on the libraries for a good book or information that will help them in school, not on topics that don't relate to school at all.     As author, Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf'. I believe she is correct, these types of books, magazines, and movies that we don't want our kids finding need to be removed from the shelves of our libraries @DATE1"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3540	2	"Censorship is a law and it is commonly broken. You cannot censor any books, movies, music, or magazines. The law of censorship is usually broken in libraries. I feel that censorship affects the writers and school system.     In the US people have the right to expressed their beliefs and feelings on any type of topic that is brought up. Many libraries are taking away the right of that by not allowing certain books to not be read in classes or not allowing the students to watch certain types of movies. I think that this would offend the person whom wrote the book or the writter of the script for a movie. If they librarian doesn't want a certain type of book in her library then she shouldn't have that job or she shouldn't have books at all. Just because she doesn't like the genre of books doesn't mean that somebody else who comes in won't want to read it. If a teacher doesn't want her class to see a movie because it's something that she doesn't like then she shouldn't even show movies at all in her class.      In school we aren't allowed to read about certain topics in the library, because the school system feels that it is bad for us to know about. If we want to learn about something we should be able to. Maybe we don't want to learn about something the teacher is teaching us about. Do we take away everything the teacher used to learn about that topic? Do we take the teacher out of the classroom? No. We show respect and we read what they want us to read about and we listen to what they have to say about the topic. It's respect, we learnt that in kindergarden. I think that they should show us respect to and let us read and watch movies about the genres of books and movies they take away from us.      Censorship is illegal where we live. But why isn't it taken seriously by the government? I think that they need to realize that what they are allowing is discrimonation to the writer. We get in trouble if we virbally discrimonate somebody. So why are they not doing anything about the physical discrimonation? We should be able to have higher knowledge on a topic we feel the need to learn about. I think this law should actually be enforced instead of ignored. It isn't fair to us or the writter."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3542	2	"I think censorship in libraries is wrong. Books, movies, and magazines are ment to inlighten, inform, and entertain the reads. If you find something offensive in the book, movie, or even the magazine doesn't mean the next person will. If you don't want your child reading or watching those things, then limit what they watch or read, don't make the people who don't have a problem with what their reading or watching suffur. They have the same right to have those books, movies, and magazines on the shelves as you do!     There has been times when I've wanted a book, but the libaray won't get it because of the adult content in the book. Yet I was raised reading those book, so to me it wasn't adult content. The same goes with the movies, I was allowed to watch rated @CAPS1 movies when I was eight years old. Yet movies have ratings that tell you if it's of for a child or adult, like @NUM1 to rated @CAPS1. The libaray has the same works, a child cannot rent a movie rated @CAPS1 without a parent present to get it for them, same goes for a movie theater.     Parent who are worried about their childrens well being, shouldn't make libraries take books, movies, and magazines off the shelves, because of things they find offensive. Other people who pay taxes for those books, movies, and magazines would like to read them as much as the next one, like some libraries bann 'The @CAPS4 of @PERSON1', because of the way the story is written. Someone found it offensive and gathered a lot of other people, whom didn't read the book but took the word from the person who did, and banned the book. If they had read the book they'd would have understood, it wasn't ment to be offensive, but a fictional story of @CAPS4.     I remember living in a town, with a lot of christin people, so the libraries only had christin books. When I went to the libraren and asked for a series of books, and was always turned down, because of the christin population. I told them 'I have as much rights too have those books on the shelve, as they have to have their books on the shelves.' I never got those books, but maybe someday they will look back on those requests and think of way they should have gotten them.     The reason I think censorship is wrong, is because no one should be able to tell people what they should read or watch. When they pay the same taxes everyone does to have those books and movies on the libraries shelves. If you have a problem with what your child watches and reads, than limit what your child reads and watches. Don't take away other people rights to read and watch what they want."	4	4		4	3	3	3

I have had an experience in which I was offended by a movie I watched.It degraded women in which they were beaten and were treated as slaves.I was offended because as I watched the movie,and I realized that these women were someone's daughter and mother.I wouldn't agree with my mother being treated that way,also I wouldn't want any other woman being treated that way either.After I watched the movie,I went and informed my mother on how that movie offended me.I am sure that the authors who write the books intentions aren't to offend the reader,however,there @MONTH1 be a way that they can restate things that they say.I know that people have their own opinion,and that people think differently.If it is obvious that the reader's intentions are to offend the reader then you shouldn't purchase a book like that.If you find a book on the shelf,and you find it offensive,it shouldn't have to be removed from the shelf.Another person @MONTH1 read the book ,and they might like it.Everyone has their own way of thinking,and how they absorb information.It @MONTH1 be offensive to the reader,but someone else @MONTH1 recieve the book and admire it.  In conclusion,I feel that if you are offended by a certain book,type of music,or movie you should learn from the movie,and explain why it offended you.If a parent is offended they shouldn't allow their children to observe it as well.It will have a negative effect on your child.Books,music,movie,etc are made to entertain,not to offend."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3547	2	"To who @CAPS3 @MONTH1 consern,         I belive that books,movies, and magazines should not beremoved from the shelfs of a library if they are found offensive. @CAPS2 books @MONTH1 seem offinsive to @CAPS2 people but to others there prospective is a lot different. I belive that if books or other things are found offinseive they should have  a speacial place for them, to where mature people will be able to read them. Books are very valuable to most people in the united states.      Many people love to read stuff that other people might find offensive. But is @CAPS3  really wrong for them to like something that someone else took the time to write. Just because one person  reads a book or magazine and they find something in there that they do not like they call @CAPS3 offensive. I have a feeling that alot more people would feel the same way.      Along with movies,and etc. I feel like none of them should be removed from the shelves of a library. There are kids sections, @CAPS1 sections, And even a teenage section. I feel like parents now in days dont want thier children to learn about stuff early in life. But i still feel like if they did not want there kids reading @CAPS3 then dont let them.     If there ever was a need to really look at something and give @CAPS3 another chance this  would be the topic right here. Libraries all over the world are all neat and organized. So why could they not make a section just for books, movies, magazines that people find offinsive. Sure @CAPS3 might take a little bit more work but hey, @CAPS2 one has to do @CAPS3.      As you can see these are really good reason why they should not remove stuff that other people find offinsive  from  libraries. I mean half of the stuff they find any way are based on true stories or they are biographys. People really do enjoy alot of these books and even movies,or magazines. @CAPS3 would be really great if this could happen, @CAPS3 would make a lot of people happy and satisfide."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3558	2	"Do you think books, music, movies or anything else that could have something offensive be removed from the shelves from our libraries? Well this is what im going to talk about in my essay.     I do not think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves. The reason is, is because just because you don't like something that one book might have in it dosen't mean that another person won't. Also, some book that have offensive things in them can help you realize the consequenses that could happen of it could reinform you about those kind of things. Also if you think the reading material is going to be something you wouldn't read or you think is not appropriate then just don't read it, it saves it so when someone else that actually wants to read something like that then let them.      Sometimes i will go to the library to find a book that i saw somewhere in a different store and they wouldn't have it, so i would ask about it and they said that if they didn't have it there then it must something in it that could be offensive to others. But i know that alot of people like those nasty gross books and some don't. People have different opinons about things, so just because the person that is aloud to take the books of the shelve or put them on don't like the book or thinks its not appropriate dosn't mean that someone else will not like it either.      Well, here is what i think of certain books or anything else that contains reading that are being taking off the shelves. I hope it makes people realize that they do like other things than you so leave the offensive readings out so people can learn that if they don't like it then don't read it"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3561	2	"Im writing to reflect my views on censorship in libraries.     I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I don't believe they should be removed because everyone has their own personal opinion on what's acceptable or not. Just because one person doesn't like something or feel that it's offensive doesn't mean that everyone is going to feel that way. What one person might not like the next person might love. They only way that I feel a certain material should be removed from the shelf is that if there are many complaints about the same material. Then maybe the library should consider removing the item. Thats why they have ratings and different sections in the library so that a person can know what kind of book they're going to read or what kind of movie they're going to watch. It makes no sense to go get a book or movie about something that you don't like or that you think is offensive, its many things to choose from. How would someone feel if one of their favorite books or movies were being removed from the shelves of libraries because of another person didn't like it? They would be upset and disappointed about situation.     In conclusion, I disagree with the fact that certain materials should get removed off shelves if felt to be offense. I hope that you will understand my point of view and take consideration of my thoughts"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3564	2	"There are a ton of books out in the world that have a deep meaning and a sense of compasion. But, other books can have mean or hateful affects on the person who is reading it. Censorship, taking books, movies, magazine, etc. off the shelves so a person cannot read or watch them, is a very positive thing.       In many cases censorship is a great thing. It protects young readers from being exposed to hateful things at such a young age. In libraires, the librarian should censor the books for younger people so they do not read the awful and hurtful things the book is saying.      Like books, music, movies, and magazines should be censored, too. Some music has a very catchy beat to it and could get stuck in a young persons head. This @MONTH1 cause an effect on that child and they @MONTH1 start to act like that or want to become like the person the song is describing.      Movies should also be censored. When I was little, my parents did a good job of censoring things that were bad for me to watch at that age. I barly had any nightmares because I was never exposed to that kind of writing when I was a child. On the other hand, my friend's parents were not the best at censorship and allowed her to watch or read whatever she wanted. She had many of nightmares from the movies or books that she read.      Now since I am older my parents are starting to let me watch and read more censored things. In my experiences with this type of material, I have had some nightmares and have personly been offened by some books. Although, censored books @MONTH1 have a great story behind them, the material that supports it can cause a dispute between different people who have different beliefs.      Thousands of books are censored each year. Many of them have to do with different religions or races that people  have different opinions on. Libraries need to censor books to protect the iniscent minds of young childern"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3569	2	"Censorship. Sometimes it's needed, sometimes it's not. Children of today are exposed to many adult things, whether it is watching tv or a movie, or just witnessing things at home. I believe censorship is neccesary for young children, they shouldn't be exposed to bad launguage, or graphic scenes, or something that is strictly for adults. They will experience these things one day, and they need to be mature enough to understand them. Teenagers on the other hand is a whole different story. They want to hear the bad language and see graphic, gory scenes. It's all about action to the boys, drama for the girls, and everyone wants to hear those juicy details. Censorship won't stop them from moving on to the next movie or book on the shelf that has all these things in them. Even though all teens act like it's not important and that their old enough to see all this, somethimes their probably not. If you think that telling your teenage daughter or son that their not allowed to watch a movie or read a book because of something it says, they'll probably just go log onto the internet and see it anyway. Nothing is censored on the internet, so if your all about censorship, don't go onto to the internet.Adults do not need censorship. There adults, they can make their own decisions and they know what they want to watch or read.Removing things from the shelves of libraries is sometimes needed. There should be sections, children, teens, and adults. There are ratings on movies, and books are written for a certain age limit so everything should be placed accordingly. Censorship is needed, but your parents or guardian are the ones who will most likely tell you whether or not your going to be able to read a book or a watch a movie. Some people find things more offensive than others. So censorship is really in the eye of the beholder. Personally I believe in censorship, but to others, its a waste of time. I wouldn't want my child watching a movie where someone gets brudally murdered and where there cussing every other word. Music can come uncensored and censored, it just depends what you want to hear. Censorship is either loved or hated, its all one big opinion."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3573	2	"In our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes.  Items should not be removed from the shelves just because someone takes offense to it.  Everyone has a book or movie out there that they disagree with, but if it is removed just for that reason then there would be a very limited selection left.  Students would take advantage of this and they would have educational books removed.     Removing items from shelves removes history.  Our history books tell us stories of slavery and descrimination.  If someone takes offense to this and has it removed then we are losing a part of our history that needs to be heard and taught so that it does not occur again.  Items in the library are items that you can choose to check out or choose to not check out.  If you take offense to an item in the library then you do not have to read it.  Something that you @MONTH1 take as offensive @MONTH1 be something that inspires and encourages someone else.  Wether you like an item or dislike it is a matter of your own personal opinion and decisions should not be made based on someones opinion alone.    Think about it.  If you have a favorite book, movie, or song then would you want it to be gotten rid of based on someones opinion?  You have the right to be able to read,watch, or listen to whatever you want.  It should not be limited based on someone elses opinion.  It would cause much argument among people.  Some have different opinions then others on a certain item in the library which will lead to argument and possible violence.     There are so many wonderful and inspiring books and movies out there and there is always going to be someone who does not like at least one of them.  If items are removed based on someones opinion then there will be a very limited selection left.  People read for enjoyment and knowledge.  They deserve to have a wide selction to choose from.     In our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes.  Our opinions should not be based on a person's dislike of something.  If they take offense to it then they have the right to ignore it.  There are so many books and movies out there that teach us of life before our generation.  We need these books and movies so that there are not repeat events of all of the rough times our ancestors had to go through.  We need these books for future generations so that we are able to teach and guide them.  Items should not be removed from the shelves based on the fact that someone takes offense to it."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3579	2	"In our public libraries we can find books that are related to slavery, drugs, gangs, prostitution and violence. Theses books all have history in them of our past. We cannot, as a society, forget our past because as many historains say, history repeats its self. If we start censoring our libraries then all that history will be forgoten, and/or lost.      Libraries can help us in many different ways. They help us with school projects, bussiness projects, and libraries better our knoweldge as a person. You cannot go censoring the libraries just because someone finds a book offesive. The stories of slavory are still taken offensively amoug people @DATE1, but if we start taking stories about people who have been enslaved and hide them from the poeple, we will slip back into that terrible past.      There are gang stories of terrifying people, such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2. He killed many people, destroyed many shops and probably even sold a lot of drugs. We need history to show our weakness as a nation and not hide because of this weakness but thrive on it to better our cities, better our police training, and most importantly, better the next generation of kids to be raised better.      There is more than just books at the public library, there are movies and documentaries of our nation and the @CAPS3. Movies that talk about @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM1 and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM2. These types of movies can show how horrifying @CAPS4 really is and how cruel people can get. During @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM2, there was the @CAPS9 where six million jews lost their lives because one person, @PERSON2, did not like them. People made movies like those to show the @CAPS3 how devestating man can be but people have made movies on amazing discoveries and amazing places. For example @PERSON1. One of the greatest findings amoug the @CAPS3.      Music can also be a good way to better ones self. If you play an instrument and you need music to play to, why not go to the library to get some? You dont have to worry about payin for a @MONEY1 cd and you can use it until your done with it then return. Then with how advanced our technokwledge is, people can get cd's to burn on to a computer and put on their ipod or @NUM4 player. Plus the library is a good place to just go look for music you like.      So, should there be censorship in our libraries? NO! There should not and the key reason as to why is because it is history. History of our country, history of our @CAPS3, and history of sad and hard times. Instead of censoring our youth of @DATE1 from history we need to set age limits. Young people of a certain age can not read certain books unless they are with a parent or gaurdian. That is one simple way to keep our kids from readin to mature thing but still able to get the history he/she needs because as historains always say, history repeats its self and as a growing nation, we need to better ourselves in every way possible. The answer to that is through our history."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3584	2	"TAKING THE @CAPS1 TO @CAPS2      Everyone will read a book in their lifetime at some point in their life.  The author cannot filter through the entire book to remove offensive language, racial remarks, slurs, etc. One offensive to a person @MONTH1 not be offensive to another.  I strongly disagree that books should be removed if they are found offensive to a specific group, person, or community.     Most books are organized in categories by maturity and genre.  The reader should know where he/she stands among these categories, so they will not be offended.  Maturity comes with understanding.            Books are sorted by genre.  Most, to all, times the @CAPS2 takes from the genre.  The era of when the book takes place is also a key factor.  When @CAPS2 an author must take this into consideration.  If the setting of the book was in @NUM1 A.D. the author would not want to use grammar from the present day.  The reader should be prompted on what books they @MONTH1 read before doing so.     From one reader to another, taking the @CAPS1 on what we read is the real solution.  Maturity comes with understanding.  If the reader is mature enough to understand the @CAPS2 then the book corresponds with the age of that child.  This is why I strongly agree that books shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive to one person, group, or community"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3587	2	Yes i believe that books should be removed if they have derogatory terms in there such as racial slurs disrespecting the race of ANY human etc. but the music part is up in the air because like kids hearing songs with cussing talking about drugs and all that other bad stuff shouldnt because like the way i see it everybodys gonna learn about it somehow and when you hear songs for multiple songs you tend to begin to know the wordsd and if you repeat the words in front of a parent thats when they can step into the aprent roll and tell them that the drugs and words are nto good. Really though if kids pick the book up and are able to read what it says then i feel like they should know right from wrong by then and clearly if someone is using bad language such as the @CAPS1 word they would know that its wrong and if they continue to listen to it thats on them.	3	3		3	2	2	2																		
3593	2	"Are books and other things found in libraries offensive to some? Why is it offensive and how is it offensive? What should be done about the books, movies, magazines, and movies that are offensive to some of the people?     In my opinion there are some books that I could think of that are offensive to others for particular reasons. Some reasons @MONTH1 include: the put down on races, comments in the book, how the author wrote it and who it was written towards.      Others find some books, music, magazines, and movies offensive because of the terms people use. Some people just get offended because they think it's directed toward them, and they take it personal.      Music can be offensive to some people becasue of the language they use in it. They might look down on it because their children @MONTH1 listen to it, and children nowadays say things they here from music and try to be like the person saying it.     Movies can be offensive because of the language, violence, the way people are treated. A good movie would be @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. It has violence, language, and people are treated in a harmful way. But overall the movie teaches you about war and the things they've gone through to get our country to where it is today.      Magazines could be offensive by the words used, such as slang words, cursing words, and violent words. The magazines could have nude pictures of people and most parents do not want their children getting ahold of things like that.      Overall, I think that any of these things could be offensive to some people, and probably are, but they shouldn't take it off the shelf because it's offensive to some. If you'd look at it in a certain way everything in the library could be offensive to someone, and if the case is take everything that's offensive they might have to take everything that's in the library. So, I do not find it right for them to take away things that are ofensive to some people. If it offends you then don't read it or listen to it or even look at it, no one is pressuring you to do it, you do it on your own. So therefore it's  not right to take the things off the shelves just because some people do not like it."	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
3595	2	"Libraries are for children, and adults of all ages. Because all people have different views on life, different beliefs, and different feelings, @CAPS4 makes @CAPS4 hard for libraries to please everyone. There are also different genres that people enjoy reading. Some @MONTH1 enjoy romance and comedy, while others like to read action books or mysteries.     Today, libraries have sections dedicated to different genres of materials. They have kids, fiction, informational, and many more. They also have different areas where you can find movies or magazines. But, if there are magazines, books, or movies, that should be viewed only by certain ages, the library should put a warning sign in the areas where those materials are located.      On the back of movies there is a rateing on @CAPS1 bad the movie is. Why not put a rateing on the back of books and magazines? This way people can know what to expect if they read @CAPS4. @CAPS4 would also help them decide if they even want to read @CAPS4. Rateings on the back of magazines and books would help destinguish what age is appropriate for @CAPS4.      Once, when i was visiting the library, there was a man in the check out line, right before me. @CAPS3 was returning the book that @CAPS3 had just read and checking out the new one @CAPS3 had already picked out. When @CAPS4 was finally his turn in line @CAPS3 stepped up to the counter and explained to the sweet, old, lady at the front desk, what @CAPS3 had wanted to do with his books. She simply understood that @CAPS3 wanted to check out and return one. As she was checking him out she was making small talk and asked, '@CAPS1 did you like your book, @CAPS2?' @CAPS3 replied ' @CAPS4 wasn't what i expected. @CAPS4 was completly inappropriate. ' As they disscussed a little more @CAPS4 turned out that there were tons of curse words throughout the entire book. This is one example of @CAPS1 people don't know what to expect when they read a book.      I don't think that libraries should remove materials off the shelves that people have complained about. They should simply do something to let people know what to expect when they read the books, magazines, or movies. Some people @MONTH1 not mind reading a book with a few curse words here and there, but others @MONTH1 find @CAPS4 outragous. Libraries spend their money to buy these books for the communities. Why take a book off if only a few people find @CAPS4 offensive? No one makes those people read those books, its by their choice. Libraries need to figure out some way to reasure people that they will enjoy what they are reading and not be offended by @CAPS4"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3599	2	"Have you ever imagine goin to the libary and getting a magazine from the shelve and you find it offensive and you cant do anything about it? Well now you can say what ever you want because Katherine Paterson and me when to a libary together we pick out magazine from the shelve and it had alot of offensive stuffs we did not like. We went to the lady infront and she dint even knew this magazines where there.  She got really mad and when back to the shelve and there where alot of magazines with offensive ritting, pictures and even comments. We got all of the magazined anf threw them away. In my own opin i think these kind of things thar are offensive like movies, music, and magazines should be remove.     They should be remove because it a bad influence to the younth, and it gives them a picture in there head and they do it later or maybe say it to the plubic or even so it in there homes. They should be remove because its getting alot of people in to trouble and making them do what they see of it, this is getting to kids and they becoming more violent to there school, friends and even moms. We have to remove all of these offensive stuffs becasue we see these every where and its easy to find like in the movies it getting to the piont where you see naked girls in every movie. The parents have to do something about it to because they are the one who are buying them and then leaving it every where in the house and its easy for the children to find it.     We have to be more care full about what we but or what we read because you can find it offensive and then your kids @MONTH1 read it and they would think another thing. So next time you buy or go some where and you find some thing offensive talk to the manager or the supervacer about taking it off.

3602	2	"I believe there should not be censorship in libraries, because if some needs to read a book about somthing and the library does not have it beacuse they do not believe or like what the book as to say it makes the reader not know what actually.     The very first reason in believe there should not be any censorship in librarys is beacuse a lot of student go there to study about papers.So if the library does not have the book that a student is looking for the library is failing its maine purpose.           The sencond reason is that if the person in chage of the library does not like a book that does not mean he or she has to read the book books are ment for any one and everyone to read.      Then the third  is that a library is ment to have books so people can read them so if the owner takes the book out and some need that one book and the person can not get the information that they neeed out of that one bookthe library is faling its maine purpose.     The fourth reason is that alot of people read books to read about something and just beacuse he or she does not like what the book has to say does not give them the right to take the book.      Those are the three mane reasons i think librays should not have censorship. The owner of the library should have any book possibel and should not shose to not put a book in it beacuse he ore she does not like what the book says."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3604	2	I think that the books sould not be removed because people know what they are reading and if they dont like the book they sould leave it. There is no reson that the people would whant to remove any book for any reson because alot of people like different kinds of books     If they would remove any books they would be alot of people mad because those people mighit of really liked that book and wanted someone else to read it. That book might of also been in there family for a really long time and they want everyone in there family to enjoy that book.     It would also not be good to remove a book because if they remove a book they have to get more books and that would cost more money to get more books it will also waste more papper.     Another reson that it would not be a good idea is that if you get another book replace the old one the people might not like the new book and the place where they have the book at will lose money and will not be good for them.     So thays what I think would be my opinion about removeing a book it would not turn out very good and the book store will lose alot of money because they got rid of a good book and broght back a reallty bad book	3	3		3	2	2	2																		
3605	2	"Censorship in Libraries     Censorship in libraries is a big problem in today's society, many people get angry at libraries and markets because of the items that they have on display for the common consumer. If the consumer walks into a library and is looking for a book to read. What if they come accross a book from the early @DATE1's? In these times there were lots of words used that are 'harmful' to our people today, but what most people dont understand is that, these words that are harmful had different meanings in that time in history. So when someone picks up a book and finds harmful or un-appropriate words or phrases in them, they instantly get the wrong idea about the book. And then, this small group of people who dont like this piece of literature, go agains the vast majority of people who really do understand the literature, and the feeling and dialect of the book. That is where i am going to explain to this small group of people, a few details that they should keep in mind when trying to rip a book off of the shelf and throwing it away.     When someone goes into a store or library and starts to look for a book, they @MONTH1 come accross a piece of literature that they dont completely agree with. When this person comes across this piece of literature, all they have to do is put it back on the shelf and move on. Nobody is forcing that person to read this book, so why make a big deal about it?  Because most people who make a big deal about some of the word usage in a book, dont quite understand the dialect of the book, or the time period the book was written in. If you do not understand the literature completely, then i ask that these people do not make a big scene out of it, and that they dont try to revoke the author's rights to have that piece of literature on the shelf.          Authors have just as many rights as we do. If they write literature. A poem, novel, or even a short story, these authors have the right to have it published and put on the shelf. So why would we not have the same rights? If we dont agree with some of the literature that are being placed in our society's schools, stores, and homes. Then we can write a novel, newspaper article, or even make a website about your topic. You can make web polls much more. This is a more indirect approach to removing a piece of literature. If you want to have a better chance of this book or novel to be removed from the shelves, you can use a poll or have people vote, to recieve other people's oppinions, and use these in your argument. If you have more than one oppinion on a subject, you @MONTH1 have a more likely chance of winning your argument. And this will cause a lot less chaos and attention to be drawn to yourself and others around you.     Another reason why i dont think that people should be able to choose what is on the shelves of libraries everywhere. I do not think that anybody from anywhere shoudl be able to come into a library and take a piece of literature off of the shelves forever. Because, in todays society, we have researchers going all of the time, and we have so many people working on different theories and laws. So if we take one important book off of the shelf, maybe a book written in the @DATE2's about evolution. And we get rid of all of these books, what will happen when we really need that information? These scientists @MONTH1 need that piece of literature to test a theory, and if that piece of literature is expelled from the shelves, then we could miss out on a large variety of major information that could help out someone in the future. So the more information we take off of the shelves, the less we will have in the future to help us will our problems.     So, now that i have told you all of my opinions on this subject, i hope that you will have a better view on the cencorship of libraries everywhere. And that maybe someday all books and pieces of literature will be able to remain on the shelves, being endlessly read by consumers"	3	5		3	3	4	3																		
3608	2	"Well do you think that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all music you listen to is offensive. Who can say what is offensive to everyone? Who can tell you what you think is offensive or not? How can you be your own person if people are making desisions for you about the books you read, the movies you watch, and the music you listen to? I'm going to tell you about why I think that no certain materials such as books, movie, music, magazines, ect., should be taken off library selves because someone finds them offensive.

How can you say that one thing is offensive to one person and is also offensive to another person?. I think if one person thinks that something is offensive to them that is ok, that is their own opioion, but maybe the next person that walks by and see's the so call offensive material will love it. You should not be able to make someone elses decisions for them if they want to read an offensive book, watch an offensive movie, and or listen to offensive music that is their chose not someone elses to make for them.       If every peson took a book off the selves that they thought to be offensive then we would not longer have any books on the selves. Some people think that certain music, books, and movies are offensive and other people think that the books, music, and movies are cool and interesting so what do you do then? I have learned over the years that not every person will agree with your opinions on everything and you won't agree with them but yet you both still have your own opinions. You both are allowed to decide what you do and dont like. You both get to choose what books you read, what movies you watch, and what music you listen to. So why should we let anyone stop us from being ourselves?     You can never say that anyone thing is offensive to everyone because no one person can be everyone. You can't talk for someone else because everyone has a voice for themselves. So do you think that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all the music you listen to is offensive? well you @MONTH1 not but someone else somewhere is trying to take that out of the libraries because they have a negative opinion about it but is that fair?"	4	4		4	4	4	4

Even if you did take some of them off then what would we show our children when they ask what was yoour favorite book as a kid.      We will have to tell them that the library doesn't have those books anymore. the had to make room for other books. So if you would please under stand we got to read all of our parents favorite child hood books.       I mean how wuld you fel if you couldnt share that with your kids? I would be upset because my parents told me and i went out and got them from the library and I loved them to So please if you can leave the books alone	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
3615	2	"No because all people like to read different books. Some of the books that people want taken off bookshelves are considered to be part of history.Books help people advance in their reading skills and also help them find new things out. When I was in middle school I always liked to read @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 books. When I asked the librarian if they had any of their books they said no. They thought that kids in middle school shouldn't be reading books with cuss words in them and vilence. I don't think it should matter what kids read because you can't make a kid read something that he's not interested in because everybody is different all people like different types of books. Theres all kinds of books like for example theres mystery books, fiction books, non-fiction books, historical books, etc. The books you use in classrooms are considered books but there not books you read everyday. I think parents should take their kids to the public library to get a book.When I was in elementry and through junior high we had to take reading tests on the computer.In seventh and eighth grade we had to sit around the room and take a book and read it for part of the hour. We also a challenge in middle school to see which school could read the most. That was part of our grade in our english class. It was never a problem for me because i loved to read.Now there are some books that libraries should take off the shelves. For example any book that involves nudity or lots of vilance. Now thats just for kids that are under the age of thirteen. Now there isn't that many of books out there for little kids to read. Theres more adult books than little kids books.All I have to say is that watch what your kids read. Don't keep them from reading books because that will effect them later on in life. If they don't like to read persuade them to try it. I also think that more kids would read if they seen their relatives reading too. Just remember kids and adults of all ages reading is a good thing no matter what you decide to read."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3620	2	"People today always seem like they are trying to find something offensive.  The problem with the @ORGANIZATION1 is that it always feels like it needs to appease these people.  The truth is that when you have as many as there is in a country, there are going to be many different ideas, thoughts, likes, and dislikes.     Libraries are places of knowledgee.  They keep many differnt books, magazines, and movies there, so that people with all different tastes can enjoy the library.  Most people, with books, figure out early what genre of books, which authors, and how long of books they like.  So books are usually very hard to offend people, because most people can usually tell right away if they like the book or not.     Magazines are like books in away.  People know what they want.  With magazines though, people ususally just flip threw the pages, and skim through articles. They will keep skiming through the magazine, until they find that perfect article they want to read.  Usually after that, they are done with the magazine.     Music has been around almost as long as mankind has been around.  There is something about music that soothes the human body.  Music is one of those things that ais constantly changing with time.  Before instruments, music was just purely voice, but as the centuries went on, music became more advanced.  Now it would be nice if there was just one type of music that everybody liked, but there isn't.  There are so many types of genres of music, that it would be hard to find a person in this world that liked every type of music.     There are people who hate change. Likewise thet don't like to change there favorite music types.  But if people changed with time, then there would really only be a  few types of music.  But since there are many types of music, there is always going to be someone out there in the world that doesn't think that song shouldn't be played.     Just in the last century movies have came along way in advancement.  Movies use to be simple, they would have a simple plot, and everyone loved it.  But there are so many people who love to see technology advance, that they want movies to change.  Movies today are all about special effects, love, sex, alcohol, parties, fighting, and the list could go on and on.  Directores try to make the best movie possible, so its almost like they try to put just enough of one thing to keep the audience into the movie.  But if they go overboard on a subject, that is when at least one person has a red flag go up in their head and think that is offensive.     Movies are suppose to be enteraaning, not something people should get offended by.  Movies are good about it though.  They have created a rating system to try give the audience a fair warning heads up, so that the audience knows what to suspect in the movie.     It doesn't matter what it is, book, magazine, music or movie, there is always going to be someone who doesn't like it or is just offended by it.  There is nothing to do about that, and it's not a bad thing.  It's just simply means everyone in this world is not the same.  So I think we can all come up with the conclusion that: just because one person doesn't like something, doesn't mean the next person will"	4	5		4	4	4	4																		
3626	2	"The seven books which constitute the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series by @PERSON1 are books which are frequently censored in school libraries accross the country. The main reasoning behind this is that since these books portray witchcraft in a positive light, they must be harming our innocent children. Many books, from @PERSON2's 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' to the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series have been banned from school libraries due to their content being deemed inappropriate by a group of people who fail to take the larger meaning of these works into account. Works meant to be accessed by the public should not be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are deemed offensive.      Under the @ORGANIZATION1 to the @CAPS7, every citizen has the freedom of speech, press and religion. By censoring the speech of authors, their rights have been denied. It is an author's right to say what he or she feels needs to be said, and it should not be up to a board of parents or directors to prohibit that right.      By prohibiting books such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' to be read; the greater meaning of these works is being disregarded. Many conservative @CAPS12 groups have advocated that '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' be banned from schools because of its portrayl of witchcraft (and therefore satanism) and the nominal fact that @PERSON3 has stated that @PERSON4 (the @CAPS15 in the series) is homosexual. However the ultimate message of the series is that love triumphs over evil. Apparently that is not a message worth teaching the youth of @LOCATION1.      However, even if every school in the country took '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' off the shelves; that would not, and should not, stop children from reading these books. Since 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' began to be part of many schools' curriculum in the @DATE1, it has been at the top of the most censored book list due to its vulgar language and a chapter involving a prostitute. That has not stopped millions of teenagers from reading this novel, which is considered to be a rite of passage for most young adults. Being one of the most continuously challenged books over the last fifty years only seems to add to its allure and its popularity amongst the very people that these censorship boards are trying to 'protect'.      If a parent, however, does not want his or her child to read such a novel; it should be left to the parent to censor what his or her child reads. But just because one parent does not want their child to read '@CAPS1 @CAPS2', does not mean that every child should be denied the opportunity to read it. Censorship should be a matter of the private, not public sphere.      Books and other works should not be censored in libraries. In doing so; an author's freedom of speech is violated and the greater meaning of the work is disregarded. And while certain groups @MONTH1 advocate to protect the children of @LOCATION1 from these offensive works; the children will still find a way to access them"	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
3634	2	"Yes  I do think that if material in a library is offensive that it should be taken out  the library because the libary is a place where people go and get a better understanding of something they dont know.Here is why I say this.     If you go to a library and you see something that you dont like and you dont think it is apppraite for people to see then it should be taken  off the shelf. I wouldnt want anybody in a libary unsatistfied with the books, movies, music or anything else especially if childern are involed.People should be able to go to a public place where they are satistfied with the way they carry their place, also it should be suitable place for childern to come and learn.The libary is a learning enviorment where education, growth and devolopement should be inspired.     My reason for saying all this is that a library should be a place where learning should be its number one goal and that if things in the libary are offensive to a person that it should be taken off the shelf. I know that childeren should be able to go to a liabrary and be satistfied on the way the libary is."	3	3		3	3	2	3																		
3635	2	"Should materials in libraries be censored? No, i dont think that stuff in libraries should be censored or taken off the shelf. If something is offensive to someone then that person doesnt need to look at that material. People should have the right to get whatever they want from the library and if someone doesnl't like the materials they have then thats too bad.     What if kids get bad stuff off the shelf ? If a kid were to get something bad or innapropriate for themselevs the libraries wont let them check it out so it is fine, and the parents should be watching the kids get.     I go to the library all the time and I have never seen anything thing that is innapropriate and i don't know anyone who has ever told me they have found something offensive in a library, because I think the libraries know what people want and what people dont want there. and it's not right to take something off the shelfs if a few people dont like it because im sure other people like it. But if there is something very offensive that everbody thinks is bad than you can remove but you can't remove material every single time someone complains it is offensive because then there probally wouldn't be anything left in the library.     So I dont think anything should be removed from shelves just because some people find it offensive because im sure just as many people don't find it offensive and it would be wrong to take it from those people."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3644	2	"Censorship in libraries is kind of a big deal in schools. There @MONTH1 be  a book that someone really wants to read, and they cannot get it in their school's library. A lot of books that are great educational books have been taken off of the shelves of libraries, because they are either too violent, or they have bad language in them. If kids or parents are offended by these types of books, then they do not need to check them out. There should not be censorship on books in schools.          There have been a lot of books, teachers view as being educational books, that have been taken off of the shelves in libraries. Books that teachers would like to give to there class to read. There should not be any problem with giving someone a book that has a few bad word, or a few violent scenes for them to read. Some of the books that are banned could relate to someone, and touch them. Banning books in libraries needs to change.          People should have the right to read what they want to read, even if the book or magazine comes from a school library. There are books that are very good that have been banned. '@CAPS1 for @PERSON1' for example was banned in public schools for some reason. This book is one of my top five favorite books, and i could not check it out of the library because it was banned. This kind of stuff needs to be open to everybody no matter the age.      Censorship in libraries is something that needs to go away for good. Many peoples lives could be changed, touched, moved, etc... due to a book. Many books that have been banned are great books that can have an effect on someones life. People should be able to read what they want to read when and where they want to read it."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3646	2	"In @DATE1's world there are so many things around our children that if we tried to take materials away, we would be take most of what is made for entertainment. Many adults say that our world has changed so much from the time when they were younger. Well, why don't we do something about it? People need to stop complaining about everything and just do something. Adults can eliminate the amount of materials the children take home with them.      If you were to walk into any store these days you would find something that you would not want your children to watch, see, or listen to. I believe people are doing the best they can to seperate these materials from the family oriented materials. Sometimes it is just not enough, children are still getting addicted to some materials at a very early age. These children share what they have with their friends, and these other children start doing the same things.        Many materials such as movies and music have negative ideas that teach children things they do not need to know or learn. The material that talks about drugs, parties, and drinking does not even need to be on a radio station or a television channel that a young child would listen to. Our adults need to also learn that it is not good for the children to learn and listen to these things, and to keep their children away from it as much as possible.     Like the author said if everyone was able to take something off of the shelves there would not be anything left. We are always going to have these things that we do not want children to see, but we can start to eliminate some of them. The others we can not eliminate we can continue to keep on the shelves and other places, but just kept where children don't go.     I believe that our towns and cities can do a better job of keeping our children away from @CAPS1 rated movies, negative songs, and different books that talk about 'adult things.' The children are the future of the world. If that's all they are watching and thinking about then it does not look good for the future. There are many things we can do to stop our children from watching, listening, and learning about these negative things in life. Keep the children away from these materials, it will be a better world if we do."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3659	2	"Censorship in the libraries. Do you think that we should be able to take movies, magizens, and books off the shelf. There are many different arguments about this subject.     I believe if they put the books, movies, and other stuff on the shelf than it should be able to be read by children and others. They need tho learn about everything thats out there in this world. because if they don't learn about this now than they will never know about all of this when they get older. I think that it is cridical for our youth to know about it.     Some people @MONTH1 say that we are two young to be looking at that stuff but the younger you find out about it the better of you will be when you get older.      So that is my input on the situation. the younger you are you can learn more about the stuff"	3	2		3	3	3	3																		
3665	2	"Removal of Books      If there is a book that someone takes offensive, should every book similar to that book be taken of shelves?No, even though people @MONTH1 find things in books offensive, they should not remove the books off shelves.      When i was in the sixth grade my teacher asked me to read and write a summary on 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. I searched the whole library for the book then finally decided to ask for help, the privilage to read the book has been taking away. The book was no longer allowed in elementry schools, due to the fact parents were seeing what their children were reading and found the book very offensive. After many reports about the book, the book was taken out of the library. For me to do as my teacher asked i had to go to a public library and get the book.        If you find a book offensive keep @CAPS3 to yourself and dont read the book, they shouldnt be able to remove books just because of what people think of them. Many people love different types of books, no matter if they are offensive or not others @MONTH1 like them.         I believe that everyone has a right to read anything they want, books are made to be read and looked at. If books are being taking away then very less books will be read. But the more books read and understood, more books will be wrote and published.          The same has to do with music, movies, magazines, ect, they all are made for a reason and should be checked out. @CAPS3 is great to learn about different things by reading, listening, reveiwing, ect, even the things people @MONTH1 find offensive, they @MONTH1 teach lessons."	3	4		3	3	4	3																		
3667	2	"Why should they take them off the shelves? If you ask me i think they should leave @CAPS1 up their. I think they should leave @CAPS1 up there. Not only is @CAPS1 happening in the libraries its happening on televisions also.     Everything in the library might not offend some people. Some people take @CAPS1 offensive when they see something thats against their religion, culture, or maybe their country. But we have the people that take certain things in the library offensive but don't worry about @CAPS1. I say, 'If  you check out the library and find something that you take offensive, don't get @CAPS1 just beacuse you don't like @CAPS1 doesn't mean other people won't like @CAPS1. So why waste time trying to fight to get @CAPS1 off the shelves when @CAPS1's really you the only person worried about @CAPS1?' @CAPS1 just doesn't make any sense how people put up a fit because a certain material offended them. Like someone said a pastor was on tv, talkin about how bad hell really is since some people don't think @CAPS1's not going to be all that bad. He was on tv at the time and this lady got offensive about @CAPS1 and had them take him off tv. But she didn't havve to watch him on tv, she could of watched something else. Nobody made her watch @CAPS1, she chose to watch @CAPS1.     So what I'm saying is that just like the author of the newspaper said, 'I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor, then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' @CAPS2 that if you want something off the shelf, think about the other people that actually want to use @CAPS1 rather than thinking about just you."	2	3		2	2	3	2																		
3668	2	"Libraries are great for multiple reasons. A library is the place to go if you need to do research, meet with a tudor, find an interesting book to read, find that one song you've been looking for, or pick out a new movie to rent for tonight. However within a library there are limits toward what they offer and what you can get. Censorship in libraries is a topic that comes up every now and then, and people will debate over whether they think censorship is a good or bad thing to have.      Personally, I think that censorship can just be more unconvienient for some. For example, when I was in the ninth grade I was assigned to do a research paper over @ORGANIZATION1's. However this topic turned out to be a challenge to research because the libraries I went to did not offer many books or resources over @ORGANIZATION1's because it is seen as an 'inapropriate' or 'offensive' topic. Also, the librarians wouldn'@CAPS1 let me check out some of the books because of my age. Since they thought that I was too young to be reading that information, they weren'@CAPS1 going to let me proceed with my research.      I think that if it's something going on in the world we live in, then it might as well be available for the public to access. If there are people who wish to not see or hear about certain topics, then they can take it upon themsleves to avoid it. Rather than just getting rid of it all together.      The same goes for any form of media. If there is a @CAPS1.V. show that you don'@CAPS1 like, don'@CAPS1 watch it. If there is a song that you dislike, then don'@CAPS1 listen to it. It is that easy. I know I do it all the time. People need to take it upon themselves and understand what they can and cannot handle, and then apply that to their daily lives. When it comes to children, and censoring certain topics from them, I think that it is up to the guardians of the child to determine what is @CAPS2.K. and not @CAPS2.K. for them to see or hear. Then it is the responsibility of the guardians to make sure that their rules, or guidlines, are set and the child understands what they are.      In conclusion, I think the purpose of a library is to offer information. Any information. Then people go to that library to find the information that they are looking for, with the wide selection the library has to offer. I think that libraries should'nt have to feel responsible for censoring items that @MONTH1 be offensive. It is their job to just offer information"	4	4		4	4	4	4

So in my conclusino i dont think its wood be ringht to take some away because some body fund it offensive you just got to look at the rest of the wrold you just got to because it wont right  to the rest of us."	3	2		3	2	2	2																		
3674	2	"The content of a library should be full of various material even if one @MONTH1 find certain materials offensive.  Just because someone @MONTH1 think a material is offensive does that mean we just ignore the subject, forgeting it altogether?  Some subjects @MONTH1 be awkward to talk about, read about, or even think about, but that doesn't mean we should ingnore them.     One subject that @MONTH1 be awkward to read about is sexually transmitted diseases.  You often see people walking through the library skimming through the aisles, once in a while opening a book to see what it's about, but when they come to the section on sexually transmitted diseases they just walk on by, to uncomfortable to be seen in the area.  It's not a subject that people normally read for fun, but everyone should be aware of it. There are many subjects like this that everyone should be aware even if you think it doesn't effect you.     Another reason to keep all books in the library is to be informed of history.  Some history @MONTH1 be gruesome and completely crazy, but we should be aware of those things and not forgot about them.  The @CAPS1 for example.  That was a very dark period in history.  Over six million people died becasuse just one person didn't like what they believed in.  It's sometimes hard to read about, but you should be aware of what happened in the past no matter how depressing it is.  We should be aware to prevent another event like that from happening.     People's likes in music vary.  There are so many different types and styles of music.  Some music @MONTH1 be offensive to other people, but does that mean you should get rid of it at the library?  The library should always have a large variety of different music.  Often people would like to widen there music intellect and the library is the perfect place to do that.      Everyone is different. We never all like the same thing.  Taking materials from the library to avoid the subject doesn't stop someone from finding that information.  If people wanted information and they couldn't find it at the library they would most likely find another way to get that information.  Having a vary in books, music, movies, and magazines make what the library is, a place to learn new things, no matter the subject."	4	4		4	4	4	4

Do you just tell your kids to close there eyes and cover there ears? Well i honestly think that shouldn't ever have to happen to you.     I think that you as a parent or adult should be warned about certain behaviors during a moive. That you do not approve your child of watching even if it is with you ,it's just flat out wrong I would say. So i say that we should get some kind of extra warning that these innapporiate behaviors are showing up in movies. Parents should be able to know what there kinds are bout to watch is ok for there age and what not.      So to wrap this all up nice and sweet. Just make some kind of label that says that there might be things in the movies or whatever item such as books and magazines also. That there might be things that a parent will find innapporiate for a child to watch or read. If the people that make these products do this it will be much more easier for parents to do the right thing for there children"	3	3		3	3	3	3

So i think haveing books that some people dont like is a great thing to have in are world. It tell you whether people are going out to see what is going on in are world if people are really caring about what other people write or say to other people.There is just one thing that people should allows keep in mind when they are write a movie or even in your local new paper the articles that some people put in the movies and papers are taking a little to far sometimes by what people say. I do bevlive that there should be a line as to what you can and not write in a book and i think that should be deminded by the write of his best judgement.Why do some people complane about everything that is meant to be told to them is because they know that what he or she is saying is very true and they dont want other people to know there past if it is bad or of sumthing tragic has happend top them whether it be in ther family something bad happend to them but i think if somebody would talk to this person they would not get so mad at someone for speeching the truth to the public.Well you have heard my side of the store on what i think about peoplle getting mad at other people for what they say and i belive that what you say is very true that we do ahve a freddom in this country."	3	3		3	2	3	2																		
3692	2	"Have you ever seen a crazy person walking around saying odd or unique theories? Everybody is different and have their own opinion about what they think is right. It is alright to have different beleifs but that shouldnt mean people shouldnt seek to understand others. I beleive that the censorship in libraries is very important but that people need to seek to understand each other more, not be so stubborn, and look at different perspectives so that people can get along easier.     Many different materials are found in libraries and some of them are more censored than others. Many times the reason that the books or magazines are censored is because they portray strong ideas and theories. People have the right to speech so they should be able to show others what they beleive, but they need to make sure that showing what they know is not hurting anyone else. Explicit movies and music are very bad with seeking to understand. They are good because of the rating systems but still are very ignorant to others.     Many people just simply take the ideas of others the wrong way. People have trouble looking at things in different perspectives and because of it they can cause trouble. If people would seek to understand more, then the conflicts of different beleifs would not be as common. When people have different perspectives, they can be more knowledgable of various opionions.     Some people are just stubborn. They choose to only beleive their ideas and refuse to listen to anyone else's. Being stubborn is the opposite of seeking to understand. If people were less stubborn, they could see more perspectives and become more aware of how others felt. When people are stubborn, it can be very hard for others to deal with or for them to get along well with others.     In conlusion I do think censorship is important but I think that the reasons why we censor things are equally important as well. If people were more understanding of others, then we could have more censorship for the things that agrivate other people. We would also have less censorship for people who only try to spread there ideas.

It's kind of a matter of opinion of whether it is offensive or not.      I myself have never really read or watched anything that was completely uncalled for. On just about every movie or music album that is produced they rate it so that you can know who should be watching this movie and who shouldn't. If the movie was made with somekind of offensive parts to it then they put with the rating that yes, their is some rude language and things like that. So just because somebody didn't read close enough to see that their might be something they don't like in the movie shouldn't cause everyone else to not be able to see that particular movie.     Personally I don't find books to be the greatest things but I am sure of that some books or magazines do tend to have something rude or crude in them but it's not always horrible. If someone thinks that the book @MONTH1 be inapproiate for some readers then they could tell a person in charge in the library that maybe they should only be letting certain people be reading that book because of the content. You shouldn't have to throw a book off a shelf because one or two people thought bad about it.     If it was me choosing whether or not to take movies, books, magazines, etc off of the shelfs I wouldn't. I say this because @PERCENT1 of the time things have been rated or in someway approved to be put on general store shelfs. People can simply read details on the back and see that it's not going to bother them in a way or that it could be offensive and they shouldn't be purchasing. If someone complained about a new cd or movie that I personally wanted to see or listen to and it was taken off shelfs I would be upset about it because it probley wouldn't even offened me at all. So no, i completely disagree with the idea of movies or books and music having to stop sales because two or three people were offended by it's content"	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
3695	2	"When people  think of libraries  they picture  this cold place with and old mad lady telling you to be quiet.Or they just picture this books every where . But libraries today has be way more improved and advance with music,movies,and etc.     When i was  young I never really like libraries  because they seem boring to me.Thats why I wasn't good read either until I was in the six grade because I discover the library was actually cool place. They different thing to do like look up books,music,or movies  you can check out the libraries. Or sometimes you migth have magazines you can check out too.                                Then at the libraries there people who don't like it because of the music,movies,and etc.This reason is because use to it being quiet in libraries and not full with kids and teens.Thats why the faithful and ones go to the libraries everyday take the new things offense to the library.     When it all boil down this topic makes me think about To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because it was offense book talking about the whites treated the negreos back then. The reason say that is because old tradition in the library are like the whites in the story and the  new things in library  are like the negreos who was outcasted by the whites.Then in book it took one little girl to settle diference and knows whats right and wrong.     Thats why I think instead of banning or remove stuff we should have disscusion.Which we can come to adgreement keep new ideas in the libraries.When do keep the ideas maybe we can make a section for thet new ideas so the people comes to library wouldn't get offend"	3	3		3	2	3	2																		
3700	2	"Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'.  Although I understand her message, I don't completely agree with it.   I believe most things such as books, music, magazines, etc. should be censored in some cases.       One reason why I think there should be censorship is because of minors that @MONTH1 want to see things that @MONTH1 not be suitable for them.  First of all, children often follow after what they see.  For example, adutly trends that they see on the television. Not all things adults do are not appropriate for the young eyes.That's why I consider that the things that are broadcast should be censored. Children are being influenced by things that they see, read and/or listen to.     Another reason why I believe there should be censorship is because of a lot of very explicit action that appears in today's movies, books, magazines, and music.  Violence is a main topic  in newspaper articles.  For instance, most front page content is about the wars and hostility in the world.  It is hard to believe that we ever had a peaceful day without any violence. Disrespectful acts, cussing, and rude gestures are not a positive way to keep a more mature role going that will make a better environment.  Because libraries are public, they are open to all eyes so we must be careful about what we allow on their shelves.     In addition, censoring is the correct thing to do.  Where would it lead us if we don't? Do we want our society to be badly influenced by a bunch of profanity, violent slogans, or jargon?  Shouldn't we all want to be treated with respect and common courtesy and avoid promoting outrageous movies, music, and books on the shelves of our public libraries for everyone to see.     So now you can see why I believe that such things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should have some type of censorship.  We don't want all the disrespect in the country, so why make it available in our public libraries?  Keep these things separate: adult books, magazine, movies, music, etc."	4	4		4	4	4	4

I really don't see the need to due @CAPS1 with all books that @MONTH1 be offensive to a single person, or group of people.      Any time I look through the library, I come across a few books that are slightly inappropriate. However, @CAPS2 I see these books, I don't make a big deal about it. I just put that book down and continue my search. I couldn't imagine how scarse out book selection would be if we were to rid the libraries of all books that people might find offensive.           Also, there are many people that find The @CAPS3 offensive. If we were to remove all @CAPS4 text from libraries, then we would have a hard time passing the word of @CAPS5 to people who do not have access to such literature.     Although I do not fully agree with the ideas of many theorists, I do not ask that their work be banned from public libraries. I don't like @PERSON1's book on eveolution; but because of our freedom of speech, he has every right to write about his discoveries and belifs.          As you can so clearly see, I am by no means claiming to be open-minded to others thoughts or beliefs. However, @CAPS2 it comes to literature and and art, I think that a variety makes us unique. If everyone read the same books, listened to the same music, and watched the same movies, then we could have a very boring culture. That is certainly not the basis on which this great country was founded!"	3	3		3	4	3	4

While I read that book it had alot of offensive language and alot of graphic not only in the book but in the movie to. On top of all that both the movie and the book weren't good at all. The only thing good about the movie is @CAPS2 was a few dramatic and thats it. Another thing that caught my eye was when the author repeatedly kept on saying the same offensive language over and over again. It's like the liked to keep on saying the same old thing using repitions. But some how it got an award and is one of the must for high school student's. I think the story overall was alright beside the fact @CAPS2 was offensive in it though. Books like that shouldn't be put on shelves and if they are the need to take the offensive language out but obviously people liked the book or it wouldn't have awards.                                   So obviously 'To @CAPS3 A @CAPS4' was a good story but when it comes down to it could offend alot of people I hear people talking about the book still and I read it last year. So In @CAPS7, I think @CAPS2 should be censorship in libraries."	2	2		2	2	2	2

Lets say i was in the library and i did see  something offensive. well the world does not stop and say ''hey look at that @ORGANIZATION1 finds that offensive so lets take that off the shelves just to please her''.  Am sorry but thats not how life works. If you dont like looking at it then turn the  other way. If it were me i would be worried about more important things such as war or things going  on in my life other then something offensive on the book shelves.     Its a big world out there and it is not getting any smaller and it is not going anywhere anytime soon. There are going to be things in life we the people dont like to look at, to maybe hear thats offensive. Heres what i say to it, get over it .

I agre some books can be offensive to some and not to others and its really not fare for thows who think that way.     One reason that i would take it for that shelf would be to keep youn childern form reading it. Parents dont really want there childern reading about vilence and murdare.      Most of what I would take off the shelf would have to be about people being racist agents another person or people. people killing others and be doing sexaule things. People really shouldent read things like that because it puts things in there heads and somtimes make the think the same way as the writer.     If childern read books about vilence and sexaule actions they could think that its ok to do these things to other people and get in to alot of trouble with the law and there parents. Children really need to be keped way from these kinda of books, tell there older and undersdtande whats right and whats wrong. Some books have alot of cursing in them and alot of childern pick up on words and start using them more and more tell it becomes a habbit.     Evern thow some books are of real people they should still be taken off the shealfs. In some of these books there is alot of vilence and childern should not be exsposed to that kinda of book     Books can sometimes be more bad then good.

NO, the reason I say that is because if it was offensive to me,they might not be offensive to other people. Im not saying things like that are offensive to me because there not. I personaly love reading books like comic books with super heros in them. That excites me.     Back to the point if people thinks a book is offensive to them then they don'@CAPS1 need to pick it up! If I knew a book would be offensive to me I would never pick it up. I know what your going to say 'but what if they didn'@CAPS1 know it was going to be offensive to them'. Well thats a gud question. Just put it up and dont complain because the writer didn'@CAPS1 know you were gonig to take it offensive or the wrong way. They were just writing a book.           It's not the writers fault. He or she was just probable writing a book that they though was a good book. When it got published and you read it and you took it offensive. DON'@CAPS1 because they exspecing there self's. So dont take no book's off the shelf's in the libraries because stupid people wont to get mad  beacause they took it offensive. Your going to ruin it for the other people that though the book was either a good book or an azsome book.     So now that we got that out of the way lets move on and get on with our life's.

3729	2	"Dear Newspaper;     In libraries I do not feel it is neccasry to take stuff away that poeple could find offensive, because honestly if it offends you than don't look at it. You are your own person and can make your own decisions, if this so called offensive material is not veiwed offensive by someone. Then why should that person be  punished by someone who has to make a big deal out of something. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean I don't like it.          If someone finds a book offensive then don't read it, if there is a magazine that you find offensive, don't read it. It is as simple as that, people are wise enough to know what is good and what is bad for them. There is no reason why someone can't choose what they want to get, where they want it. From observations of my own I have seen numerous times when someone has found someones music offensive, but they don't say anything. They just ignore it, the world needs more people like that. More people who will stand up for what they believe in and won't judge others for what they belief in.     It seems as if the world is becoming filled with a bunch of people who care way to much about what other people are doing. That is not a bad thing nessaccarily but everyone will be offended by something but it is your choice to whether or not let it bug you for the rest of your life. Listen to what ever music, read what ever books or magazines that you want. If someone finds them offensive, so be it. You are your own person and that won't ever change. Do what makes you happy and nothing else."	3	2		3	3	3	3

The reason that I think that no one of any age should think about these bad things is because if kids shouldn't know about them than, then why should the same kid that has grown up know these same thing. But if things like this are in libraries thenthe question is who should be in charge of deciding what is right for wroung?      Sence the worlds population is so large and so many people have diferent ideas then how could we get one person to look through all things and decide between good or bad?

I agree with katherine paterson if we can take one book off the shelfs we can take all the books of the shelf.      Katherine Paterson says if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that I abhor.  Which  means that if one person takes a book off the shelf then so does everone else then we will have no books to read at libraries. This is why I agree with katherine on this subject books are wrote for us to read not to be sensored just because so stuck up parent doesn't want their kid reading some book that so many other people enjoy.       Magizines that people think are offense then the should put in a differnt area so the kids cant get them. The same with movies so movies are not ment for kids, but that doesn't mean that we have to take them off the shelf! One thing we can do is put the valgur moves that we dont want are children watching behind the counter and have the libraian get them when we watch them.     As far as for the books make a separte part of the library for books that kids shouldn't read, such as romance or horror books, adult books, some action books.  Music is another thing that some parents have a had time with because of the offense lyrics in them, but some poeple like that kind of music so we can't take that away from them because we don't like it. does that seem fair??     Now does some of those books seem a little better now?  Yes we still dont want are kids read valgur books about killing, and romance, and serial killers, but for some people enjoy  reading those novels.

Most language arts are sorted through out the library in an orderly fashion, so the younger children will only purchase there age level books, or art of choice.      Music always contains warnings for the rating of the book. a child should never murchase a mature level book. books, movies, and music are all the same. they are made for certain types of audiance. If a movie is rated @CAPS1, then it is made for eighteen or older audiance. They are situated throughout the library for children, adults, and teens. The children just need to stay in there own age levels.      If there is a mature or graphic book in a childrens library then that should cause conflict. any parent would agree with that statement. The only way these mature arts can be shared without conflict is through public libraries. public libraries that are divided to connect with all age groups"	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
3770	2	"Censorship is a very sensitive topic. Everyone has to deal with censroship whether it is directly or indirectly. There have been many complaints and arguments involving the government regarding acts of censorship throughout the past. If censorship were to be equal for everyone, there would be nothing left in the world to be censored.     Censorship is a major subject when dealing with books, newspaper articles, movies, and other literary subjects. The writer or director must be able to create an interesting topic or story line while at the same time keeping it appropriate for most audiences. If everyone were to censor one piece of literature or film that offended them in a certain way, then everything in life would be censored in one way or another. No matter what, there will always be a certain situation in which one person in the world will be offended by. Censorship is wrong, especially in the @LOCATION1; the @LOCATION1 citizens are granted the freedom of speech and the freedom of press. With an understanding of these basic freedoms, one would think that censorship is against the law considering it is one of the five basic freedoms granted to @LOCATION1 citizens. Censorship is wrong because it violates at least two of the five basic freedoms granted to all @LOCATION1 citizens. There should be absolutely no censorship when dealing with books, movies, and newspaper articles, because they all deal with the freedom of speech, or the freedom of press. If the act of censorship begins to expand, everything we know today will become censored in some manner just because one person would find it offensive.      Some citizens @MONTH1 argue that censorship is a positive thing because it filters out all of the inappropriate, offensive, and derrogatory language and situations from our nation's youth, but from a teenager's standpoint, the children will find out about such situations and language use regardless. There is no point in hiding the truth from anyone, because no matter what they will find out eventually. We need to push for less censorship in the @LOCATION1, because if we want to keep our five basic freedoms of life granted to us by the first amendmant, then we need to fight back censorship and remove it completely from our society"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3784	2	"In the literary world of today it is never hard to find a topic that will interest you. Science fiction, thriller, romance, how to build a car with household materials and many more topics all await you at your nearest bookstore or library. With this vast array of topics it isn't that surprising that you will find some authors that have decided to go against the norms of society and write a book that is controversial in the ideas that it presents. These books will often get put on a 'burn list' or censorship list and will be taken off the shelves of the local libraries in order to protect the patrons of those institutions from those books' ideas. Many have argued that this is a way of keeping the society pure, but this censorship of literary works is probably one of the biggest mistakes a civilization can make.     Removing books from the shelves off a library is a form of censorship, which is a clear violation of the @CAPS1. In the @LOCATION1, everyone has certain unalienable rights. These were written out in our @CAPS1 as the first ten admendments to the @CAPS1. One of those rights is the freedom of speech, or the right to voice your opinion. By remving a book from the shelf of a library, you are silencing the author of that book and thus taking away that author's freedom of speech. This clearly violates the @CAPS1 and thus is unconstitutional and illegal in the @LOCATION1. By violating the @CAPS1 openly, this opens the door for other areas to be violated in the @CAPS1. The president is now a dictator, we are now a communist country, and many other actions are allowed, leaving the @CAPS1 as a scrap of paper with no meaning. Without the @CAPS1, the @LOCATION1 is just like any other country and has no direction. This leads to a downward spiral of our society.     The silencing of the voices of authors also stops new ideas from coming in to a society. Every year thousands of new books are introduced to the @CAPS8 public. Many of these have novel ideas that help shape our society for the future. If you take these books off the shelves, and out of the publics hands, you effectivly stop all change from new ideas in a society. Nothing would ever get better, and the society would stay at the same level that they were when the censorship began.     Censorship can also lead to the downfall of a society. In the novel '@CAPS9 @NUM1' by @PERSON1, the censorship of books has gone so far that all the great literary works of the world are banned. Anyone who is caught reading a book that 'makes the think' locked up or killed. The main characters job as a fireman is not to put out fires, but to set books on fire that encourage people to think. The censorship of that society had gone so far that no one did anything, they just sat at home and watched the television all day. Many people will argue that pornography is something that should be censored out of society, but the problem is once you start censoring, where do you stop? Censoring out pornography would lead to romance novels being censored, which would lead to magic books being censored, and so on until you are censoring out @CAPS10 @CAPS11 or the @CAPS12. By censoring out the books and movies that make people think, you quickly lose all intrest in higher learning. That is why censorsip can quickly lead to the collapse of a society.     Although censorship @MONTH1 seem like a good idea, it is really one of the largest mistakes a society can make. It can lead to the silencing of all the voices of change in a society causing society to grind to halt and stay right were it is. Not only is it determental to a society but it is also is clearly unconstitutional if you look at the @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1. So let us hope that all though we @MONTH1 play with the idea of censorship, that we never go down that winding road to no where"	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
3789	2	"They will see it eventually. There is no reason to censor a library, I believe. I think they should be sectioned off, maybe put the 'offensive' books in the back  of the libarary is enough censorship. You have to look at it in the publishers view also. They want to sell and advertise their product and they have a right to do so. Libraries shouldn't take their product off the shelves just because someone stumbled apon something they believe is offensive.          We all know what offensive things we could find in a library or a bookstore like @ORGANIZATION1. Things that show innaproperate pictures, drugs, firearms..ect. I believe they are already censored enough. Most of magazines that many people find 'offensive' are always put in the back of the store or secetioned off so people don't stumble upon it or have their childern flipping threw the pages corrupting their minds. Some material are even put in a plastic sleve so the person must puchase it before reading.          If you decide to write and publish a book, don't you think you should be given the right as everyone else to put it on the shelves and promote it? I do, there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to. The library shouldn't censor your book just because someone else thinks and feels it's offensive. That's not fair in @LOCATION1.

3807	2	"Every person is different, and in being different, people have many varying veiws as to what is or is not acceptable or offensive. Something that is very offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else, it is all a matter of values and beliefs. Libraries contain a variety of books, music, movies, magazines, and other materials on a variety of topics, some of which @MONTH1 not be appropriate for everyone.     I do not believe that a material should be removed from shelves just because one person or a group of people find it offensive. The offended group is not being forced to read that book or magazine, listen to that music, or watch that movie. Materials are placed in a library for the public to enjoy, not just to please certain people.      I do beleive, however, that materials should be clearly sorted in a library. If they are clearly sorted, people are less likley to take something that offends them by accident, and can completely avoid books, movies, magazines, and music that they do not to read, watch, or listen to. This can also help keep children away from unwated material.      To conclude, materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. What is offensive to one person, another person might enjoy watching, listening to, or reading. It is impossible to please everyone, because every person has different veiws, but a situation can be avoided by careful organization. If everything that was found offensive to certain people was taken off of library shelves, there would be nothing left"	4	3		4	4	3	4

Inconclusion i hope the people at the libraries take the offensive stuff off the shelves.It would bring move people in and they would have more respect for thoes people. The public would`t have to worrie about picking up a book that has alot of stuff that thier kids do not need to see, read, or listen. That goes for movies, music, magazines, books and more. I really hope the people make the right choice"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3815	2	"In many libraries there are books, movies, magazines and much much more. Some of these items though are seen as inappropiate for certain ages. I believe though that every customer in the library should have the ability to choose what they want to read. It is up to the parents or the child to decide what they want in their heads.     Let us start with books. There are many different types of books. From scientific data about human anatomy to dragons and vampires. How can you choose a book that is deemed appropiate for you though? The answer is simple. When you are younger, your parents help you choose the right books to read and as you mature, you begin to make thoses choices yourself. It is up to you whether or not you should read a certain book.      Movies guidelines are along the same pattern. Your parents helped you choose appropiate movies in your youth. When you grow up, you learn to read about the movie, and look at the rating. If it seems to intimadating, or innapropiate, or violent, you make the choice to see it or not.      Sometimes you see offensive material in movies or books. If you dissaprove of it strongly take the dilemma to the librarian. Discuss why you think the movie/book is unnappropiate and offer some ideas on how to deals with the situation. Some suggestions could be: to remove the item from the shelf, or to write and extra review on the book, or write to the author/movie director. The simplest solution though is to just leave the offensive item alone. If it offends you, just send it back to the library and warn your friends not to check it out. Others @MONTH1 still enjoy the item even though you don't.          There are many books, movies, magazines, etc. out in the world. Some @MONTH1 be deemed as innapropiate or offensive. There are many other choices that are 'okay'. So if you don't approve of a certain book, just send it back to the library and find one you do like."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3821	2	"Everybody is in tittle of making their own desicion. If that includes not letting their own children look at certain books then that's okay, but that doesn't mean they have to make that desicion for everyone. Everyone has their own opinion of certain books that might be less modest than others that just how it is, but to take the book out of the libraries is not taking in consideration of others.     If there are some books that are offense to a certain type of ethnicty or religion ect. then just ignore it and go on. There is no reason to take those kinds of books out, for what we all know that certain book might be used for research and that person that needs. Taking out certain books of the library are depriving the youth from contemporary literature that is going to be very imporant for the future. The @CAPS1 is a good example, in the time it got published many people wanted to get rid of the book because it was not traditional, that book is now being used in our class room and is teaching us many literary techniques. There are countless books just like The @CAPS1 that are being taked out of libraries now and that could be deeply appreciated by the future writers.     Katherine Paterson has the prospective of many authors, taking out books that are offensive to people is going to cause us to have no books. For hard working writers it is unfair to work so hard and have the book band from the libraries because a certain group of parents didn't find it approving. If they don't approve of the book then tell the child not to get it. A library is a place to enjoy the countless amount of literature of many different styles and should not be restricted. The library is a place of discovery not a place of restriction."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3825	2	"It has been brought to my attention by some members of my community that the local library is planning to remove some materials such as our books, movies, and music. I've confronted them and they've made no such such effort as to amend the censorship that has already taken place. I understand that some works @MONTH1 be found offensive to some audiences, but I believe all people should have access to the knowedge they wish to acquire.     These works they wish to condemn and banish are works of passion and labor. What I've noticed is, the materials they view as compremising are some of the most passionate, heartfelt labors of expression; and I firmly believe this removal act hurts more than those that are banished. This denies those artists of their own freedom of expression and represses something simple, our own expression.     The capibilities of the human mind are limitless, but yet those who display it's functions are limited. Knowledge is the key to unlocking a much more vast understanding of the world around us and I believe this censorship highlights what I attempt to depict in my own exposition of our minds. I believe we have come very far in the evolution of our liturature and I would hate to see the flame of inspiration for creation snuffed out in a modest dash. Just out of a few broken heartstrings? Or a spare tear lost upon the earth, dusted by some ignorance forsaken, missunderstood language doomed to be lost; out of a loss of understanding? I think not.      In conclusion, I've noted what I wish to converse and I firmly stand against this censorship. I'm only one voice, but this is a call to arms and I believe we can accomplish great things together. So let's get the word out and defeat this repression of expression"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3827	2	"A library is a place to rent books, music, movies, etc., that you don't have at your home. Some people go to a library to use the computer for a project, or to check out books, musical materials, movies, etc. @CAPS1 isn't a bad thing if the library has materials that are offensive to some people. If people don't want to see material that will offend them then they shouldn't go to the are in the library that contains the offensive materials.      In my own personal opinion, @CAPS1 doesn't really apply to me if there is offensive material in the library. If there is going to be offensive material in a library then you should be a certain age to rent @CAPS1 or read @CAPS1. Not just anyone should be able to walk into the library and check out these offensive materials. If someone that is under this age tries to check out this material, then they shouldn't be aloud to have them.     Another opinion of mine on this subject, is if these kinds of material offend someone then they could not go to that area of the library. Instead the person can go around this section of the library or they could not pay attention to the materials. The library could make a certain part of the library made just for these kinds of material, so that people nor children have to see them.      Also, if a child wants to see these kinds of materials then they could find another way to see them. They don't necessarily have to go to the library to find these kinds of things. If a child wants to do something badly enough then they will find a way to do @CAPS1, or in this case the child will see something that they want to see.        If parents don't like these kinds of materials in the library then they should teach their children not to look at these kinds of materials, if they catch their children looking at materials that are offensive then they should punish their child and let them know that they shouldn't look at those kinds of materials. A library shouldn't have to take off their books, music, magazines, etc., just to satify parents.      If the library took these kinds of materials off of their shelves then they would lose business. So in theory, libraries should not have to take their materials off of their shelves just to satisfy parents. Libraries need money so that they can buy new materials and without customers they have no money which enables them unable to buy new materials. So parents should keep track of what their kids check out at the library. Offensive materials should not be taken out of libraries, these kind of materials should just have rules."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3843	2	"When you are taking your little kid to the library because they want a book you think 'hmmm, there isn't anything bad at the library its all education books.' @CAPS1 would you feel if your child wanted to check out a movie there? You would be ok with it because no one thinks there are bad images or movies at the library.     A little girl could be with her mom at the library in the adualt section and they could see some things you would not want them to see. The romance books usually have girls on there half clothed and the guys in basically nothing. A child could easily see that and not know what it ment but they would have theat image in there head for a very long time.Some of the kids could go up to the movies section and pull out a scary movie that shows blood and guns.      Its not just the kids seeing the stuff its everyone. A teen could easily get a book and not be paying attention and see stuff about the other gender. A couple could go in the library trying to find a good healthy funny movie, but could find a movie that would make them uncomfortable. An older person could try to find some music from back in their time but when they get it, all of it is about drugs, sex, or even acohole.     The magazines always have girls half clothed, even in seventeen magazine. The car magazines of girls modeling infront of the cars to make them look better or irristable. You can get a baby magazine and it shows a mom breast feeding. You could have jsut wanted to look at if because of the babies you or your child do not want to see a mom breast feeding.     The library is a very resourcful place and you can get very good information about things there. They have some bad parts about them too. I think they music that talks about personal things and bad things should be in its own little place. Same with the magazines, movies and books they should all be in a room together away from all the rest of the items in the library. They should have an age limit you have to be to be able to go in that room. They should tell you what type of stuff is in there before you go in.     I'm not saying the library is a bad place for kids or teens or anyone. I just think that certain books, music, and magazines should be kept in a different place instead of out in the open where everyone can see them."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3847	2	"As I walked through @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 as a young girl I saw a @CAPS2 magazine book, seeing this and being a girl that likes reading that magazine I opened it. I soon found out it was a book that I would never actually read. I found my self embarrassed  and wondering why they wouldn't make it clearer that it should be censored. I think that censorship in libraries and book stores is a good thing. Yes, kids need to learn about relationships and intimacy, but that is their parents jobs. A @NUM1 year old girl should not be able to see an inappriate movie, magazine or book when ever she wants because we need to teach them ourselves. Censoring magazines gives children a chance to find who they are not what the world wants them to be.  Censoring the book helps by keeping small children 'sheltered' they don't have to know everything by age ten. It gives them time to grow up themselves. The movies that are made give a false out look on what sex and intimacy really is.      You flip through magazines and see child stars everywhere feeling the pressure to grow up. They think they have to dress like an adult and act like one too. Children see this and think that if @PERSON1 acts like that so should I. The magazine industry really hurts children in the long run. They put the super skinny model in a barely there bikini. Sports @CAPS3 prides its self on that. Maxim has the '@CAPS4 @NUM2 a bunch of @CAPS8 laying around in clothes that barely cover them. The boys all think that its @CAPS4 and that that's what every girl is supposed to look like. They get the @CAPS5  magazines and drool over how the center fold looks. Letting small children see this makes them think that they have to dress and act a certain way. It makes them think of you dress like this when you get older you can get all the boys too.      Today there are so many books on how to keep your man happy, how to spice up the bedroom, @NUM3 things to try in bed tonight that a child could just walk and see. Many of these books have images of how do this and that. That it could really make a child and his or her parent(s) feel very uncomfortable. When yougo to @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 or any book store they have a relationship, love section that are all these kinds of books. Many young people @MONTH1 think love, oh I bet that's @CAPS7 or a @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 book. They see the cover that intrigue them. They think oh this girl is pretty.Censoring these books can give an ease to kids and parents. The kids can just grow up the way that they should.      Now movies give a very large false pretence on what sexual intercorse really is. They see the people do all these things and they think that its normal and you don't have to worry about a thing, but kids here's the kicker sex is not just sex. When you have sex you have to make sure you are safe. This isn't just fun and games. In @LOCATION1 today many young @CAPS8 get raped. Does it show that on the movie no it doesn't, many young @CAPS8 as little as five go around thinking about how awful it was to raped, but yet we set back and let pornography be made. Pornography is false, @CAPS8 don't just look at eachother andget turned on. Sex is never going to just be sex, and by censoring the movies kids don't get that idea before they really learn and have the knowledge of what sex really means and is.      Censoring is something that I strongly believe in. To this day my parents still make sure the movies we pick are appropriate. Parents and children can learn about sex whenever they want, but some parents choose to wait. By putting those movies and those books in a separate area it gives parents the chance to teach their kids, and the kids time to grow"	4	5		4	4	4	4																		
3849	2	"Having offensive books and movies in a library shouldn't be allowed. If you were in a library and you saw a book or anything that you took offensive, more than likely someone else will find it offensive too. So, by eliminating the problem before anyone else sees it, will reduce problems before they even happen. Now, more then ever, you will find offensive things in libraries. More people get offended by lesser things now.         One reason to have a censorship in libraries is that, if you had a child, would you want them going to the library and seeing derrogitory writings and movies? I would be very upset if my child had to see that. It's teaching them different values and it's teaching them that since it's in a library it must be okay to do out in the community. For example, if the library has a book or movie about doing drugs or anything sexual, they're going to look up to that and more then likely do those things, which they could end up harming themselves or others.     If the goverment provides the taxes for the libraries, doesn't it show that our goverment doesn't care about the offensive items on the shelves? It gives them a bad name. If we look to our goverment for support and answers. How would we feel if they had no judgement about the offensive things in libraries? It would seem like they didn't care and that might cause panic throughout the country.Which would cause many more problems then needed. It would be a easier thing just to censor our libraries.     If our libraries weren't consumed with negative and offensive literature, we would have a lot more room for things of greater value. We could have books and movies that are educational and will actually teach a person something. Rather than, lead them into making bad decisions. There are plenty of other sites and places you could get a book if you really wanted it. Not just the library has books. You could find one quite easily if you tried. If a library does have offensive things,  I think they wouldn't have a large variety, so it would be a better decision just to look for it elsewhere, where you could find a larger quantity of the subject you are looking for.     When I go to the library, I go there for educational books, not books that teach kids how to 'fill a bong' or 'different sex postitions.' I highly disagree and I think it's a negative outlook on our society by putting those things in our future generation's hands to read. So by putting censorship in our libraries, not only will calm down some of the problems that are re-occuring in our communities, it just might eliminate the problem completely."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3856	2	"The library is a place for people to go and read whatever they want. Some people just enjoy reading and others go to find information. People are allowed to read and write whatever they want and sometimes it might offend others but there's nothing you can really do about it.      Sometimes there might be inapropriate books at the library or the super market but even if it doesnt apply to you it might to someome else, for instance say there's a book or magazine talking about being homosexual and you dont think it should be allowed but someone who is might find it interesting to see how other people deal with it.        Another topic most people argue about is books about sex or drugs. Adults who have children don't want them reading about those things and in some ways they might because in a book it might show the reader how there bad for you and that you shouldnt do them. I know I ike reading books like that because it just shows me how it messes peoples lives up and I dont want to live like that.     There are some things I dont think should be allowed like books, magizines, music, and movies about racialism. I don't think its right for people to talk about others just because there skin is a different color, they have just as much right to be here as we do. Another thing that bothers me are movies about people that have problems like adhd or down syndrome and other kids bullying them because its not there fault there like that and its just inapropriate.   Some people don't realize what they write might hurt others  and sometimes they write them for that purpose and even though we @MONTH1 complain about them no good ever comes out of it because everyone has a freedom of speech and we just have to deal with it and go on with our lives. And if there are inapropriate things at the library you dont like or don't want your children to see then don't let them go."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3857	2	"I think that some material should be removed from the shelves if they are racist or contain unsightly images. But that brings up the question about racism almost all of the classic books have some form of racism in them such as To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that book uses the @CAPS4 word to describe african americans, but when that book was published that was common talk now people look at you like you have just murdered there first born child if youu were to use that word.      For the most part though books are not all that offensive at least none of the books I read. I know that there are books and magazines such as playboy and maxim that are offensive to women and have probably cause a lot of breakups and divorces, but they have laws on who are able to buy things like that. I know that kids still have a way of owning magazines like that but they are a small percentage of the kids.     I know that during @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 over in germany many books were banded because they had something to do with catholicism or something that @PERSON3 believed was bad and not what he believed was the perfect race. I know that for a short time alot of what @PERSON2 wrote was banned for using the @CAPS4 word but people have to realize that when @PERSON2 was alive that was everyday laungage.     As for me being catholic there is a codex of forbidden books that is a list of books that I am not supposed to read as a good catholic. I have no idea what those books are and what got them on this list but they must be very rude and vulgar to be on this list. I can see how some of those books could be banned.     As for music I think that the only music that should be banned is the kind of music that talks about killing police officers and hurting the people that are trying to make our country a safer place. I know that all of this rap genre is what my generation is into even though I dont see why kids like that kind of music. I also think that music produced by the arian brotherhood should not be allowed in libraries because there music is overtly racist.     I dont think that movies shouyld be banned form the libraries because of violence or anytning of that nature. I do think that the movie should be banned if it contians anything of the nature of pornagraphy but they do not let those kinds of movie in the libraries anyway  so they are a step ahead of me.     I do have to agree with Katherine Paterson on what she said that if I have those rights then everyone else does to and there will be no books on the shelves because someone will find that offensive then someone else will find something else offensive and soon eventually there will be no books left on the library shelves. My view of what I think is offensive is very relaxed compared to other's I do not get offended at a lot of things"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3860	2	"Don't you hate when you come across a book that you wish was never written? I'm sure we all come to that point in our lives, constant readers, or not. Like a qoute i once read, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf then you also have exactly the same right and so does everone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'                         - Katherine Paterson, Author     If you ask me, I think there should be a certain autority to these books. Maybe if we could make a petition and have at least @NUM1 people sign it then the book could be removed. All of this goes for music, movies, magazines, even bibles in librarys.      I'm not saying we should make a law that says if one person dosen't like something then no body should have the right to have it. But as a public if enough people all agree we shouldn't have something then maybe its best that we dont. We all worry about our children, having to keep a constant eye on them making sure there not getting into something there not supposed to be in. Same goes with books and movies, even music and magazines nowadays, and for certain people, even bibles.     Now dont get me wrong, I'm sure we all know that when a child goes to a library and trys to check out an 'inapropriate' book then the checkout counter will deny the child and take the book. But just think for a minute here, That doesnt meen the child cant go into the library find a book and just read it there. Theres also the senario where, mind me it @MONTH1 not be your child but with todays crime records then this is very probable, the child could grab a book, magazine, even a film and just steal it.     In the long run there are many things we can do to prevent things like this from happening. There could be an adult section of the library, not just for '@CAPS1' rated books or films but just a place where we can keep all the books we dont think children should be reading. Still we should definately have the option to petition off books we don't think our children should be reading. Think what you will but this is my opinion of library censorship, hopefully its yours now too."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3861	2	"Why Should you be offended? The @CAPS1 is a place where you come and get what you like.The Libraries are organized for a reason,what I like is my prefence.You don't have to look at it if you don't want to. Everyone has there own taste.     Books, movies, music, and magazines are made for people to look at, read, watch. ect.. People have a prefence and they like to have it avaible when they want it. Libraries are great use for that. People go to get what they like to watch, read, and listen. And other people should not get offended by what other like.     Most Libraries are organized into sections for children, young adults, and adults. If there is material that you don't think is 'ok' for that sections then you can ask for it to be removed to another section. But don't think something is offensive and make it be removed because you don't like it. How is that fare to others who might like it.     If you are offended by a material that is in a section of the @CAPS1 that you think is not 'ok' then it ok for it to be moved to another section. You don't have to look at something if you don't like it. Someone else might like it. Libraries are made for all people, and everyone has there own taste. Don't be offended by what others like."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3862	2	"Libraries are a place for everyone; from young children, to the eldery, therefore there is material to suite all ages. When you go to a library you assume that no matter what kind of book you are wanting to read, they will have it. From personal prefrences, to school research projects, libraries should have it all right? Well some libraries want to take that concept away.      A library has books on nearly all subjects. That is because of the individual differences of the people that go to the library. Someone of an extremist religion group could be going there to read on something of their religion. If a strict @CAPS1 would happen to find a book on the extreme religion they could be offended. That situation could go both ways though. Because of the individuality of people and different beliefs and customs we are all going to appreciate and depreciate all different kinds of literature.      Most of the libraries are big enough to be sorted into sections. There are sections for young adults, mature adults, children, non fiction, fiction, science fiction, and so on. If a child ventures off to the mature adult section and flips through the pages of a book that is above their maturity level, then that is the childs fault. The mature people who can handle the content of more adult-orientated books shouldn't be punished by the library removing all books of that content because a child didn't stay in their designated area.          With different cultural beliefs comes different beliefs and views of everyday things. Some readers could strongly disagree with a book and others could recommend it to all of their friends and family. One book to one person could mean something totally different to another. It could be understandable if there were books about sex, for example, right next to the childrens' books, but that isn't the case in most libraries. Libraries could even have a restricted section that warns readers about the content of material in the books in that specific area.      Books in libraries are wrote for multiple kinds of people. Age, gender, religion, maturity, race, political beliefs, and so on will all effect the way you take to a book. Whether or not a book appeals to you is about your beliefs, values, or customs. With that being said, why would a library take away books that only a certain percentage of people will disagree with? Taking away books of a certain subject could upset people that like that type of book or it could even pertain to their everyday lives.      A library is a place of knowlegde. It is filled with facts, beliefs, theories, and opinions of people. Wouldn't removing someones opportunity to read into a subject be revoking the author and their freedom of speech? Just because of a controversial subject or mature topic shouldn't mean that people shouldn't be allowed to read it. If people could only read certain literature that someone else is deciding whether or not it is okay to read, then where is their freedom?       A library is a place for everyone. It has all different kinds of books for all different kinds of people. A libraries interior could be arranged to that the young children aren't going to find a book about sex near their kid books. Taking away certain books pertaining to controversial subjects isn't fair to those who don't disagree with that topic. A library should be a place of balance. A place where someone could read on anything they want to, not what certain people think they should or shouldn't read"	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
3867	2	"In a library, should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Many people @MONTH1 feel upset if they find a book or magazine or any type of material that is inappropiate for anyone to see/hear.         Inappropiate material is commonly referred to as pictures and or words that @MONTH1 offend people. The words in songs can be offensive. Talking about girls in disrespectful ways in music can offend girls and listeners. Pictures can also be offensive in many ways such as sex, race, and violence.      I believe that, if a book, music, movies, or magazines upset you then you should stay away from that section or just that material in particular. If you have been to a library you see that kids mainly stay in the kids section anyways; and if you're an adult then you should be mature enough to ignore what bothers you. I have been in a library a few times in my life. When I search for what im looking for, I ignore what offends me or upsets me.      In a library, should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? My answer is no, for the reasons I have listed above. People should be mature enough to stay away from and not let the offensive materials in a library get to them"	3	3		3	4	4	4

Reading is just a part of life If you dont know how to read you are most likely to not be sucessful. Even if you know how to read a little bit, if you just the knew the basic words people would probally fine but people deffinatly need to know how to read. No, I do not think they should take anything off the shelf.     Why would they take anything off the shelf? If anyone finds it offensive they should simally not read it. Just because it offends them other people @MONTH1 find it interesting. If peolpe just started taking books off the shelf because they were offended by them, who knows how many books we would have left. people can  be offended in the most easiest ways. We could have no books on the shelf because almost every book out there can offend someone in a way.The same thing with moives, moives can offende people justr the same as books. I think moives would offend more than a book would.     In conclusion, Books, movies or anything of that matter should not be took off the shelf because it offended someone. Many people get offended in this word way to easy. One person @MONTH1 love a book and another person hate it. Just because you hate it does not mean it should be tooken off the shelfs"	3	3		3	3	3	3

I would say a vote would be reasonable because many people have many different beliefs, in which some could be offended. So I would take at least ten different people with different religions,backgrounds, and so forth, and I would have them all vote on which they thought they should do with the offensive books.      People believe differently, so it would be hard to please them all. That's why a vote with different types of people would be effective for almost anyone. Just like my mom said, 'you will never make everyone happy.'  @CAPS1 are so many things out in the society today that can offend people, and what might majorly offend one, might have no effect on the other. This is the main reason voting is rough, because @CAPS1's a wide variety of people on earth today. You would have to probably also look at how many times the book has been checked out before, because @CAPS1 is a possibility that no one in the voting group has the same opinion as those who have checked it out before.      Although if the book is voted to stay in the library, I believe the book should be labeled in the correct area. Due to the fact that the book could be offending to some people, should be labeled incase someone who doesn't know, like a child, comes upon that book.      Voting is used in our society today and has been very effective for many years now. Voting doesn't only have to be used during an election, but also can be used for this reason as well. Voting is always important and people should notice that. I believe that voting could be the answer to many problems in  the world today"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3888	2	"Should offenive material be censored? No, censoring books, music, movies, magazines, etc. takes away from our freedom as an american citizen.  If you think books should be censored, then think about this.  Would they take 'hell' or 'damned' out of the bible because those words are considered offensive?  I do not think so, those words give power to the book.  @CAPS1 books, considered offensive, are an insigh to history and culture.  Taking away these books will limit education.  Books should not be censored.         I very resent and much talked about case of censorship is the popular book '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1.'  The book tells the story of a young white boy running off with an older black man.  In the story, the word 'nigger' is used frequently.  A lot of people were offended by the using of this word, so they republished a new version of the book, replacing 'nigger' with 'slave.'  @CAPS1 people were happy with the word change, but others felt that by censoring the word they were taking away a very vital part of the story.  I agree with the latter statement.  The story's setting was back when black people were slaves and known as niggers.  I agree that the word nigger carries a heavy connotaion, but that is the purpose of using the word.  The author used it so that the reader could get a feel for what life was like back then.  When thinking about the coming generations, who will not know about slavery or black oppression, the book gives a raw insight into how life was for a black man. The word itself is a symbolism of slavery, without it, the book is not as powerful.       Censorship is a fine line, and everybody has a different place where they draw that line. The story of @ORGANIZATION1 is just one example of censorship.  On television, nudity and language is censored when dubbed inappropriate.  It should be up to the parent to decide which books there child should read, which magazines they should buy, and which television programs they should watch.  If the parent sees the book as offensive or think that there child should not read it, then they should be the ones who makes sure their child does not read it.  The books should not be taken of the shelf because they will entertain and educate other children or parents.  Books should not be censored, if a person does not think the book is appropriate, then they do not have to read it."	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
3889	2	"Imagine @CAPS1, you are in the library looking for a book to read, to when your son or daughter runs up to you holding a magazine of questionable nature. What do you do? A library should not have inapporiate items on the shelves. Censoring libraries is something to protect you and your family. Libraries should be censored so that way everyone can enjoy themselves.     The first reason I thing that libraries should be censored is because of the children that go there. Children are curious and they are always attracted to things that are colorful and different. An example I have of @CAPS1 is my baby sister. She wanted to go to the zoo instead of the museum because as she said 'I want to see the animals, not a boring statue. I can see those anytime around town.' @CAPS1 is showing that children want to see different things and if they were to go to the library and see the same items then there is not anything to worry about. The first time they see something of questionable nature they would want it because it is new.     The second reason that libraries should be censored is that sometimes not all of the items in the library are put in the right place. Say that you wanted to watch a movie that sounded really good and you checked it out at the library, went home, put it in, and find out it is not the movie you thought it was. What if you rented that movie for a party and had guests over? Would that not embarrass you? Well something like that happened to my cousin but she got a @LOCATION1. She was embarrassed for weeks after it happened. All of that embarrassment could have been prevented if the libraries had to be censored.      The third reason that libraries should be censored is that sometimes seeing certain material in a library can be rather offensive. Would you be offended by seeing something like that? I know that I would. I would not want anyone to be offended like that. When I was little I went to the mall with my grandmother. We were trying to buy a new pair of jeans for me. I got offended when the salesperson said that I 'looked fat' in the jeans I had picked. I know what it is like to be offended and people should take other peoples' feeling into account before they offend.     While some people thing that inapporite material is fine to have in a library I believe that they should find other places for it. Think of your family and how much you love them. Think of what not having  a censor on the libraries can cause. Do you want to be responsible for not doing anything to help?  Try to find ways to get stricter laws on censoring libraries"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3892	2	"Here in @LOCATION1, it is in our constitution that says anyone can have freedom of speech. Freedom to say anything they wish to get off their mind and express individuality and opinions. This should also include books, music, movies, magazines, and any other form of entertainment. However, there will always be people that could take offense to others' ideas and opinions that comes with freedom of speech.     In a case where someone was to find a certain type of material to be offensive at a public library, then it should be known that he or she should not observe the type of material given. He or she should not throw a tantrum over something that they find offensive while other people find very enjoyable. It is in that person's standpoint that they should realize and come to grips with freedom of speech. What they @MONTH1 not like could very be what others do like.     So, why should other peoples' form of enjoyment be censored and taken away from them just because of one bad lemon? It shouldn't. Everyone expresses themselves in their own way. It's a form of getting positive and/or negative energy out in a healthy way. Whether it's writing books, posting articles, or writing music, it's a way to vent and some people @MONTH1 like that venting person's style. It is completely up to that person who takes offense to materials on whether or not to observe such style.     Censorship should not be allowed in libraries. If there was a type of censorship, it would be taking away what some person would like to enjoy. It would also be taking away the artists' or authors' freedom of speech and expression. There are books that were banned from schools throughout the country. Just because they think is right doesn't always mean it is right. Sure, they just want the people protected from certain offensive stuff. but why keep them from the real world? Let people out to see what this world is like and it's various types of art."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3906	2	"No Censorship     Do you enjoy reading interesting books, watching superb movies, or listening to appealing music that some people don't approve of? Most people would answer yes to the question because anything that a person reads, watches, or listens to @MONTH1 be found offensive or crude to someone else. Certain materials in libraries should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because different people find different materials offensive, people sometimes specifically come to libraries to search out materials they can't find elsewhere, and if a person finds a material offensive, they don't have to keep reading, watching, or listening to it.     The first reason reason why censorship shouldn't occur in libraries is because different people find different materials offensive. Each person is different, and people have all sorts of opinions on books, movies, magazines, music, etc. Also, several different ethnicities exist in the world and many nonfiction books educate people on different cultures around the world. The ethnicity of the people living in the culture @MONTH1 find what the authors of nonfiction books are writing about them offensive because the book is talking about something in their culture they wouldn't want the public hearing about. However, the public needs to be educated on the cultures of different people. Students do research in libraries for research projects and essays. Also, books pertaining to racism such as To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 and books about slaves @MONTH1 be offensive to the race that is being victimized in the book. In contrast, some people @MONTH1 love the book because of the a good theme, symbolism, word usage, etc. So, who would be the judge of whether a material is offensive of not? If the person who is doing this for a certain library finds many materials in the library offensive, the whole library could close down because many materials that could have been popular were taken out of the library.     Another reason why certain materials shouldn't be removed off shelves if they are found offensive is because sometimes people specifically come to libraries to search out materials they cannot find elsewhere. Libraries are the one place that people go if they are looking for that certain book or maybe even a movie they can't find at a video store. In my experience, there have been an infinite number of times where I have wanted to read a book I have heard about, and I've gone straight to the library and found it there. Also, because no video store exists in the town I live in, I go to the library for movies because I know they have a large selection. Some of the books and movies I or other people like @MONTH1 be found offensive to others, so if they were taken off of library shelves,I'm not sure if I would go to the library as often.     A third reason why censorship shouldn't occur in libraries is because people don't have to read what they @MONTH1 find offensive. Everyone has the choice of what materials they acquire from a library, unless it's something they have to read for school. If a person hears about a book that @MONTH1 be found offensive to them, why would they read the book. Also, if a person accidentally checks out a book or watches a movie from the library that they find offensive, they can always just stop reading the book or watching the movie.      Censorship shouldn't occur in libraries because everyone has different opinions. Libraries assume that if someone finds a material offensive, they'll just stop reading it. Also, if libraries take out all the materials anyone finds offensive, what will be left to read, watch, or listen to?"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3911	2	"I think that none of the books should be removed from the shelves of a libraries.  I think that everyone should have a change of reading any book they want to. Just because a person or few people don't like it dosen't mean remove it.  They don't have to read that book.  If I did like a book i just don't like it.       everyone has their own choice of what kind of stories they are into.  Like im in to freaky novels.  Everyone I hangout with is not in to freaky novels.  In I mite not be into what they are into.  Like I dislike a lot of love stories not them all just a few of them I don't like.  I can say I am in to abnormal stories.  I like fiction stories then nonfiction.       My most favorite novels is 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2'.  Most people would want to remove the stories with bad lauguage or vocabulary off the shelevs.  I know a lot of poeple that are into those kind of stories.  I think that would be unfair to do that.  Why take away what they like in not what you like.  Like I am into all kind of sex books.  Some poeple wouldn't want those books on the shelves either.         Just by removing someones type of book could make people don't want to read anymore.  I know it would make me stop reading if I can't read what I want to read.  Now think to yourself would you risk taking away someones favorite book. In the results of them not reading anymore. If you do theirs something wrong with you.  How would you feel if that was to happen to you.  So you all way pose to look at it in anothers persons point of veiw.         You should look at all the possitive way first.  Like how happy dose that makes that person that reads the books.  Not olny would it effect the read but the person who wrote the book.  You will be doing a lot of damage to a lot of people.  You would be putting someone out their job.  You could mess up someones family of living.  You could take away somones belifes.          You can make what they thought was a good thing into something bad.  You can drive a person crazy.  You can make what that person stand for meaning nothing at all.  Books could be a way people escape the real world.  Reading books could give people more things to talk about. Books can be a way of learning how to deal with thing in a better way.         I suggest that people should just leave the books wear they are at.  Books are way people express how they feel, they life style, and what they been threw etc.......  Life is hard in books makes it eaiser for some people"	3	3		3	2	2	2																		
3927	2	"Dear newspaper editor,      @CAPS1 I am writing to tell you about the censorship in the libraries of @LOCATION1. This doesn't seem like a big problem to some, but a very major problem for others. Censorship has removed books, music, magazines, movies, and other things, from the shelf of local stores and libraries for being offensive to the seller or workers.     Its not what some store owners or library owners like in some cases, but its not about what they like. Its about the people in general that have a certian intrest towards that subject. Some people have even removed the @CAPS2 from local library systems.      Does it even matter what the owner wants to sell? In most cases, no. The belief in a religon or even a book, magazine, or movie that had one small comment about; sex, drugs or alchol is removed for just that. If we remove everything about any of that, the only thing left @CAPS3 be childrens books. Some people @CAPS3 find ways to get those censored as well. We @CAPS3 become illiterate without books, magazines and other things of that nature.     Theres even an account of a person being fired from there job for reading a magazine on there break at work! What happens if we all listen to another person that wishes to remove a book off the shelf? Then another and another, we @CAPS3 have no books in our libraries or stores.      This censorship is a major problem, very few people really care about this subject. Most think it should be done to most items, some think we dont need to censor anything, as we are a free country.      So newspaper editor, please question yourself, ask yourself, '@CAPS3 I like to have all of my favorite magazines, books, and movies gone forever, never to be seen again?' Then everyone will know the answer."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3932	2	"Censorship in libraries is almost a primitve if not childish way to exclude what one might think to be offensive from everyone else, is it not? Think about it. A kid who doesn't let another kid play with him at recess today, only because he stuck his tongue out at him during math the previous day, seems pretty childish, and several much more reasonable solutions come to mind to anyone who sits and thinks about the situation for more than a second. This scenario runs paralell with censorship in libraries.     A book is a book to be read. That is, of course, an obvious statement. But why read a book? To get information. To learn something that you did not know, or to build on knowledge that you already had. How do you cook an exquisite meal? Go read a book to find out. How do you graph linear equations? There are books that will explain it for you. Is it fair for an avid astronomer, fealing no need to know how long a turkey needs to stay in an oven, to remove a book that teaches that very thing? Now, of course cooking a turkey will most likely not come across as offensive to someone perusing through their local library, however, think about this. The book has been written, so is that not a sure sign it is not offensive to at least one person, that being the author?     There are things people will not agree with. And just when you think you find something everyone likes, someone will come along and disturb the peace. Not everyone likes rap music, but it is still playing on the radio. It is free choice to listen to it. It is a free choice to read a book, regardless of what it says. Just because people have the misfortune to be subjected to material they find offensive, by accident or otherwise, and then project their disdainful comments toward someone in charge, does not mean that the offensive material should be thrown out.      Perhaps, radios and libraries can be even further examined. Radios have specific channels, playing specific music. There is a country music channel for those who want to listen to country music. As for libraries, there is of course the @ORGANIZATION1, but that is about as far as categoriazation goes. Suppose books be even further distinguished by the location within a library. A certain area designated for certain genres. That way, if you happen to find books about @CAPS1 concentration camps distasteful, then you can avoid the @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 ailse of the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 section in your library. Problem @CAPS8. I find it hard to see something as offensive if I can't even literally see it.     You see, outright removal isn't really the best option for pleasing dissatisfied people. Compromise is. Now, after having thought about this situation for more than a second, I'm sure you have thought of much more reasonable solutions than something so ludicrous as censorship. Now the best part is seeing people enjoy books, and not being offended by the ones they don't like anymore"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3938	2	"I think that the bad books, and all the adult books, magazines, and all the other articles should have its own room in the libraries. If you don't want little kids and teenagers in those kinds of books and magazines then put I lock on the door and if you have proof of @CAPS1 that shows your @NUM1 then you are going to be aloud back there if you don't have proof of @CAPS1 then I guess your not going back to the adult section.     I say this because they have movies at the movie stores that are not aloud to be seen unless your @NUM1, but the thing is kids have imaginations that if you read a book you can also see pictures just like a movie. The movies in the movie store are locked up in a back room where you have to be @NUM1 or older to go back there and look. I bet its ruff when your kid is reading books and getting bad words out of them and saying them around like an even younger sibling, because then thats just going to cause a bigger problem then what you started out with.     People have to understand theses days that kids are growing up way to fast to just leave stuff like that laying around. Parents need to keep stuff like magazines, movies, pictures, books and stuff like that up away from kids. I feel like once you become a parent you automatically think your smarter than a kid but yet kids are pretty darn smart. I understand its only a word but its disrespectful to have your kids running around cussing and saying inaproperiate things to nice people.       When kids do that then othere parents that don't let their kids do that stuff think ' wow these parents obviously don't care'. I have a feeling that its never going to stop but it would be better if childrens parents did not let them cuss around other people ok at home if your parents don't care then sure but when you go out to eat or something and your son or daughter is over there cussing like a freight train its all because of those books she has been reading, the magazines and the movies.      Im going to close this little description now and im still against kids cussing under the age of being a mature teen"	3	3		3	3	3	3

Or be around.     One important thing that I have that means so much to me & my @CAPS4 is the @CAPS5 that my @CAPS6 gave to us right before he passed away. Me & my @CAPS4 have been wanting to listen to it for a very long time. But we just cant get the nerve to do it. We do not like it when someone thinks they can just do what they want by walking up there where we have that @CAPS5 and just grab ahold of it. @CAPS1 me and my @CAPS9 do not like that. So we say something. Thats one thing that we @CAPS10 like for anyone to touch. Because it means so much to us!      Most @CAPS3 think we are crazy because we @CAPS10 like anyone to be around or touch it, but all I have to say is that there is other @CAPS3 around this area that is more crazy about there things being touched. For example: ' @CAPS10 be over there by my clock hanging on the wall I @CAPS10 want you to knock it off, so get away from it! ' That is something that my bestfriends @CAPS11 had said before. & she still feels the same way still to this day! But I mean its just how we feel about everything around us that means alot.     But to get back to the situation about why do @CAPS3 get so fustrated about things that are hanging on the wall, or things that are in cases and thats where they have been for years and years. Its because it means so much to them. Its not just cause there mean or because of some kind of reason to gripe. It just because it means so much to them, & when I say means alot to them, I mean a bunch bunch!! There just trying to say that it means more then anything to them and they do not want it to be bothered. Just try to understand what there trying to say to you. Because it could mean so much. & you could get to the point to watch out for it also. Just to help out.     But the store that Katherine Paterson had wrote is saying the right thing. & she also probably has things in her life to that means alot to her. You just have to reconize what she has that is so important because there is alot of @CAPS3 that have impotant things in there life, & you could be one of them. Just try to see & feel how alot of other @CAPS3 do around the world around you.

3943	2	"What I do think is that they should keep everything in the library. Some people like to stay and read the newspaper and listen to music while out in the library. If you do think it's offensive, then don't read it or just pick out another book. Everybody has their own ideas on a library and if they want their voices heard let them speak it out.      What I think about all this stuff in the library these days are good for the kids so they can learn faster and have a lot more to look forward to when they do get older. My own experiences in the library that I do see that there is a lot more people in the library and there is a lot more you can do instead of reading books most of the time. You can read magazines or newspapers to pass the time when no one is home or to hang out with, and it does get boring just reading books so try something different for a little while then go back reading the book that you did start with and wanted to take a break from.      Then other people have their own voice to say something if they don't want it in their library. Some of my observations that I have seen were not really good. I've seen some protesters in front of the libraries and I have seen them close down because of it. But people sometime can take it to far and do sometimes burn it to the ground. I have seen people cry over it and it makes me really upset that I want to do something to help them but I really can't do nothing.      The most valueable thing is the kids and young children that read the books. What if someone burn down you home, this is how these kids feel when you close down the most safe place to them? They have the biggest voice of everybody put together. That if you do something that make them feel better that would be really good to them. That they have not done anything to deserve this kind of mess that we put them through. It is very difficult to have somewhere to go to read but there is nowhere to go.      If you don't want to be quiet then let your voice be heard aroud the world and have the freedom to let it come out. You have three diffenent voices your own, other people that do or don't agree and you have your children. So which one are you going to listen to?

3945	2	"We all find things offensive, wether it be in a book, magazine, movie, cd, tv show, or a newspaper article. Libraries hold all of those items and somepeople @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not want to remove the items that they think are offensive, but would that be right? If everyone went to the library and took everything that they thought was offensive off the shelves, we would have nothing left.      Maybe writers should just cut down on things that are innapropriate, racist, or things that include foul language. Then not as many people would be offended and they would not have any problems with letting their children pick out books on their own. Although, it @MONTH1 not be the writers at fault here. It @MONTH1 be the readers. Some people should just stop taking everything so seriously, then they would not have to worry about things like what their children are reading.     Yes most adult things now are innapropriate for children, but that's why it is for adults. Children have their own selection of books and movies. And parents need to realize that maybe they should take their kids to the childrens section. All types of entertainment are categorized by age and people should start paying more attention to that. If parents started watching what their kids do, then they would not be worrying about the reading or watching something they should not be. That is what parents are for, taking care of their children and some people do not do a very good job of that.     If there is a book you read and it is something you do not want your child to read, it is probably something you read when you were older, so do not worry about it until they get to that age. And maybe then it would be ok of they read it, because they are old enough to realize right from wrong. Parents can not always control what their children do. And if they do by chance pick up the book their parents never wanted them to read, they @MONTH1 see it in a different way than their mother of father did and they @MONTH1 learn a very valuable lesson from it."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3951	2	"Imagine walking into a library where the shelves are empty. A library where there are no books to lose one's self in the pages. A library where we are not allowed to read controversial classics that fill and open our minds to new views. A library where works of literature such as @ORGANIZATION1, To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, and @PERSON1 are not on the shelves awaiting students to dive into their pages. Some of the greatest books ever written are respected for their controversy and mind blowing ideas. Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice which is being taken over by modern technology.     A number of children in the @LOCATION1 are unable to read at their appropriate grade level. This number is greatly increasing due to poor education opportunities, lack of interest in education, and lack of resources in the @LOCATION1. Reading is the fundamental basis for each and every school subject. It is proven that children who are successful readers are five times more likely to be overall more successful students. However, by censoring what books are allowed in a classroom and library we are taking away a child's chance to broaden their minds. We are also taking away books that @MONTH1 interest a child. Children are @PERCENT1 more likely to read a book that they are interested in. Allowing a child not to read a book, such as '@CAPS3 @CAPS4' is unpractical and harmful to the child. By taking away a book that students greatly enjoy it discourages them from reading altogether. A person not only has the right to the best education one can receive, they also have the right to read whatever they want.     Books open up a child's mind to new places and adventures that they @MONTH1 not ever be able to experience in their lifetime. Books have the ability to broaden people's minds. Some of the most interesting and controversial books that challenge an individuals beliefs and thoughts are being taken off the shelves and no longer readily available to people. @LOCATION2 was founded on the basis of freedoms; freedom of speech, freedom of thought.  Why should this freedom not apply to books? Why should any person be allowed to tell another person what you can and can not read? And why should these books be available to everyone through public libraries? This freedom should apply to books. No one should be allowed to tell another person what they can and can not read. And these books should not be censored in public and school libraries. No one should be denied the chance to learn.  By censoring books in libraries throughout @LOCATION2, millions of children are being denied the chance to learn.     We live in a world where televisions, computers, iPods, and cell phones can be found in most homes and in everyone's hands. Books are thought of as 'a thing of the past' and not up to speed with today's technology.  However, books are an important part of one's education. Censoring libraries discourage kids to read even more than they already are discouraged to reading. Kids do not want to be told what they can and can not read and by taking away the books they want we are supressing their minds. Censoring will only make them want to read less, and play on the computer more. Censoring in libraries is also a pointless and non effective method. Kids with internet access can look up almost anything on their home computers. The things they find on the internet will be more controversial then the majority of books that are being censored. A favorite book of many kids is the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series. These books have been taken out of many libraries for their use of witchcraft. However a child could go home and watch the movies or search the internet for something more controversial. Censoring is pointless because children have other ways of viewing things that would be censored in a library.    Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice that is being taken over by modern technology. Today's youth is exposed to wars, terrorist attacks, gangs, domestic violence and drive bys everyday. The world of books can be an escape from the world they live in. Books can help a child overcome poverty, mental challenges, and violence everyday. The pages of books fill them with hope and give them courage to create a better future for themselves. The inspirational stories in books have inspired millions to achieve more then they thought possible. Censoring would take away the chances for our future generations to become inspired by these books. Censoring would only hurt our youth and the greatness that they can accomplish."	5	5		5	4	4	4

Yeah theirs thing's that shouldn't be on the shelf, but how are kids and people supposed to know to get that or not. If kids arnt alowed to get certant material on the shelfs, Then it shouldn't be their, @CAPS1 my oppinion.     Parents @MONTH1 think differnt, parents might think only certant things should b alowed at a libray. @CAPS1 not their choice though. Anything is alowed to be at a libray. If you dont want your kid reading or getting certant thing's, then when your kid goes to the libray go with them. Help them pick out a book.     In conclusion i believe you should be able to check anything that is on the shelf. Kid or if your an adult. If your not alowed to get, then why is it their? I dont know i couldnt anwser that question, other than why is it their? @CAPS1 my oppinion though"	2	3		2	2	2	2																		
3953	2	"'@CAPS1 are you reading' asked mom. I immediatley hid the book behind my back, knowing she wouldn't like the idea of me reading such an in depth book. Some parent don't like for their kids to read some content. If it's not okay at home it shouldn't be okay at school. There is some subjects that maybe we shouldn't but we do because our parents say no. Removing said subjects will remove the chance of disobeying or parents, and coping behavor from book.                There are books, movies, magazines and music that is 'cool', but not all that appropriate. Some movies and music use offensive language and actions that some kids pick up on and refelct actors, actresses and artists. Soon they start making a name for themselves by using such language or actions and eventually becomes known as the bad kid. Students such as myself are inferior to being popular or noticed, so they feel the need to do things to become noticed. Most things students model after are the things they see, hear, or watch, such as the media.      It is wise to set censors in the libraries, for students. Though some students don't nessicearily want censorship in libraries, it is only for their best intrest to remove materials that are offensive. It will make students including myself better people by not learning of the things we hear about or watch. I think by using censorship it will help student to make the decison at home to to become involved in such thing.      I have noticed that students often watch how movie stars and famous people act, if they are a fan or the famous person then they are more likey to model after them and do the thing they do. Lets say I was a fan of @PERSON1 and I read that she stole something. Being a fan of her I would either find someone else to model after or do as she does because it cool. If I did the things @PERSON2 done my parents would most likely kill me, and if I got luck somehow and they didn't then I would go to jail for sure.      So  in conclusion, I think censorship is important in libraires because it insures the well being of students and protects them form things they odn't need to be part of. I would respect the idea of censory in my school becaus eI would know it is only there to help me. I hope that all students see that it is important not to be subject to violence, sex, drugs, drama, through movies, music, magazines, or book"	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
3959	2	"If there is any books, movies, music or magizines that is offensive, then I think it should be removed from the bookshelf because of caution for little kids. Everyone wants to look at different movies, books or music that isn't right for kids, but we all have too know where kids get acts from. The books can be left on the shelf, if the younger kids does not bother them. They have to know that adults don't always want to watch kids shows. There should be a right that adults can remove books from the shelf if its not right for there kids. Yes, books, magazines, movies and music should be left off the shelf if offensive. This is neccasary because they can watch the movies and learn bad habits from the shows, listen to the music and learn bad words, and look at magazines and see bad pictures. So have kids stay away from offensive materials.           There is a lot of younger kids that love to get into stuff they are not suppose to. Such as bad movies not for their age, because kids learn their bad habits from t.v. shows or even movies. If the movie is offensive then it should definantly stay off the shelfs. Inless it is just grown ups in the house. If movies are just laying on the on the shelf or around the house. Younger kids could always just grab them not knowing what it is and go watch it in there room.           Horrible music is just as bad, because they can listen to it and get their bad language from the @CAPS1. If parents don't want there kids growing up to be bad people then I advice all parents to keep the worse @CAPS2 away from children and hide them all. They can always hide them in the rooms, in a desk draw for child safety. Have all kids stay away from offensive and bad items they are not aloud to be around.      Magazines are bad to look at if they have pictures not neccasary for children. Watch all children around the magazines or look at the magazines before allowing them to read it. There @MONTH1 be disgusting pictures that children can not see that young. So make sure they all stay clear and far away from them.      I would keep all items away from young children at all times, if they are not good. Just watch all children around magazines, movies, and music. All of these materials, all children can learn bad habits from. If they are not offensive then don't worry about them getting them to watch them, because it wont be bad. They all want to live a life sometime and act like they are adults. So, sometimes you have to treat them like an adult. Yes, make sure all books, music, movies and magazines all stay away from young children if they are offensive. Movies needs to stay away from children because they can learn bad habits from the shows, music needs to stay away from young children because they can learn bad language, and magazines needs to stay away from young children also because they can look at bad pictures they arn't suppose too."	3	4		3	3	4	3																		
3977	2	"I do not believe there should be censorship in our libraries. By censoring our libraries, they're censoring us. This is supposed to be a democracy, not a dictatorship.     A good example of censorship that has recently happened is rewriting all the @PERSON1 books just because they use the 'n word' and some people find this offensive. The thing is, this is how they talked back then, this is just the way things were. People can't just rewrite books because they don't like the history behind them. They can change all they want, but in the end it still happened. We recite history so we don't make the same mistakes again, and this is a good example of it.     Music shouldn't be censored. Music is a form of expression, and by censoring the music, you're censoring the artist. They say the things they do for a reason and they work hard to create the things they do. We're supposed to have freedom of speech, so now why are we getting these freedoms taken away from us just because a select few deem it inappropriate. We don't make anyone listen to anything they don't want to. Each generation has it's own style and music, has it's own problems and ways to deal with them; our generation is music, so let us express ourselves.     Movies are censored due to language and content, which I get, but actually removing them from our libraries should not happen. If the audience is mature enough to handle it, they should be able to watch it. We don't need to take out curse words or remove inappropriate scenes just so childern can watch them. If they are really that bad, they don't need to watch them period until they are mature enough to handle it.     Magazines should be censored in the same way as movies, by maturity level and age. I agree there are some movies that are inappropriate, but taking out articles just because someone in charge doesn't like what's being said is wrong. We can't just block out all the bad things that are happening in the world and just pretend nothing's wrong because the stories aren't being told. People deserve to know what's going on. People deserve to read, watch, or listen to anything that they want. By censoring things, they're only going to make us search to find them, therefor making it kind of like a reward to get to see the things others find so inappropriate that they're willing to go out of their way to get rid of them.     You can't please everyone, so just elt us make our own decisions. Censoring our libraries is like censoring us. We have our constitution, we know our rights, now why are people nowadays thinking they can change them? They can't keep us dumb by hiding things. We're still going to find them, they're just going to make it like a game of tag; so let the game begin"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3979	2	"Kids today have a whole lot of options of books they can or cannot read in the schools library. The things they cannot read are censored. School systems have good reasons why they censor some book, and I agree with the cooperation. The facts on why books are censored in a school campus is to much racil slurs, profanity, and unaproperit situations.     How many schools have books that have racism in it. Racism happens in books all the time. In fact one out of fifty books contain racism. The big book is '@PERSON1' fin by @PERSON2. It recently got banned from schools all over the @LOCATION1.     People all around the world are trying to teach their kids what to say and what not to say. Kids pick up some bad language from the books they read. Even though some of these books still lay on the shelves of the schools. It is up to the kids not to read them.     Uniproperit situations is why schools only order some sports illustrated magazines. The school librarians don't want the kids looking at any nudity or violent scences in the books. Do you say to blame them?     I believe that the schools and parents are doing the right things. It is up to the kids to make the decision to listen or not listen to their parents. I believe censorship is a great thing for @CAPS1 youth."	3	3		3	3	2	3																		
3980	2	People out there have the right to descide weather or not there childs books have censorship in it. Some parents dont want there child to read books like that till they get older. Kids in grade school dont know the book they are getting has profanity in it.           I think that in all grade schools and middle schools should have no books that have censorship in them. Yea some parents dont care what their child reads. Think about the ones that do. Not every one has the guts to say something to the school. If you ask me i would not but books with censorship in them in my childs school.     Then again the high school students are old enough to look threw the books and descide if they want to get that book or not. Yea some parents still care about their child when they get into high school but high school students are old enough to make their own descions. Some students @MONTH1 not relize what book they grabed untill they start reading but thats when they turn around and exchange it. I think high school students are smart enough to choose their own books.     This is why I think bout the books and magazines etc. with censorship should be removed from the grade schools and middle schools and not high schools. If you agree YOU can do something about it. Talk to your childs school	3	3		3	3	2	3																		
3997	2	"If content in a library is considered offensive, @CAPS1 should still remain on the shelf regardless. Perhaps the media would prove inappropriate for many, but select few will still value the media for what @CAPS1 is. Taking one kids cake because @CAPS1 has to much frosting would anger most kids (and adults).If a book, album, movie or a magazine is known to contain offensive or inappropriate material @CAPS1 should remain organized with the rest of @CAPS1's kind, not exiled in the furthest corner. When one checks out such media @CAPS1 they should be required to state they are comfortable with the fact that their media might contain inappropiate and/or offensive content.I personally find @CAPS2 @CAPS3 or in the context of a song, @ORGANIZATION1 fascinating. Every time i look up these poems i have to accept an agreement that I am comfortable with @CAPS1's violent or hateful content. Although, I do agree @CAPS1 should not be readily available to anyone looking for something new to read(or listen) without their consent.I believe that simply asking the costumer if they are comfortable with a form of media's content would prove suffice. No one wants to settle for less or no frosting, and they should not have to."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4003	2	"First, libraries are a good source of information. At the same time a library can have pros and cons to its information. Some information should be only seen by adults. Have you ever wondered what if a child got their hands on an adult book? What's one way we can stop this?     Next, you can find information about everyday life. Through magazine, movies, music and books are ways you can find them out. You have explicit music where the artist curses, and says inapropriate things. There has been books from my past experiences where an author just talked about her sex life. I have a past experience with magazines too, such as '@CAPS1'. All these have to stay out of libraries or put in a section where children can't reach them.     Third, parents should monitor their children when they go to public places anyways. The library should be divided into different parts. Music isn't really necessary at a library. They could throw the music out. Also, at the same time children shouldn't get their hands on the books but they would have to learn about that stuff in life eventaully. The committee should have a contest in which people of any age of the community could write an essay telling their opinion also.     Finally, I've came up with a plan to fix this situation. I personally don't think they should throw these books out because this is how people make a living and some people actually like these things. So they should set up an adult section in the library where you have to be @NUM1 or older to enter and a identification card to prove it. Also, you must have a membership to that department. That way we don't have to worry about censoring these books, etc. Children will not be able to proceed in this section.     In conclusion, libraries are a good source of information. So they shouldn't throw these books, music, magazines and movies out. The library could just set up a different section for certain things and people of certain age. In that way they won't need censorship"	4	4		4	3	3	3

4012	2	"My views on censorship in libraries are alike in many different ways.     Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive to more than just one person.  If they are not that big of a problem they shouldn't be removed.       People might change their mind about going to that particular library, if they find a lot of offensive things there.  Also having these offensive things in libraries greatens the chance they could be read by the wrong minds, and it could possibly change how most children act, or think.  A few things that I would find, that would bother me are books or magazines that contain drugs, nudity, horrible violence, and bullying.     From my own experience, having books that contain these types of problems are very offensive to most parents and can effect the way you live, if you take them seriously.  Some libraries don't even realize that they have these offensive books, magazines, or videos.  I have had a teacher take a book away from me and I got in trouble for reading it, even though it was in the library where anyone could have grabbed it off the shelf and read it.  In my opinion I think libraries should take the time and look through the books they have and decide whether or not they  are considered offensive to parents if their children were to read them.     I agree with removing certain materials that contain offensive things, from all libraries.  Also I believe if parents could choose they would decide to get rid of all the mean, nasty, and offensive materials"	4	3		4	4	4	4																		
4017	2	"There are two things that i would have to say about removing books off of a library's shelf. First being that there will always be something offensive to someone no matter what it @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not be. Second, no matter what you do or try to do there will always be something that a child will do or see that you @MONTH1 not want them to see or do.     If people could remove things that they find offensive then there wouldn't be anything on shelves or in stores or really anywhere. There are too many different kinds of people who @MONTH1 dislike too many differnt things from anyone else. If a person were to remove a book, and another person wanted to get that book, but found that a person requested it to be removed that person whouldnt be happy and stop coming back to that library after one person had to ruin something they enjoy because they found it offensive.     So what if a book found offensive was removed? there are much worse things on television. Cartoons are more violent then what most books are, more and more commercials and other types of advertising are using wemon, money, and fame to lure people. Most of the time they are not meant for children, a billboard on the way to school advertising an alcohol product, or some kind of adult enjoyment, they are part of life.     No matter what you @MONTH1 try to do to keep your child 'safe', just will not work these days. No matter hard a person @MONTH1 try to change something they find offensive there will be something just as equal around the next vorner, be it a billboard, a poster, a movie cover, or a band, someone will always find something offensiv and teach their children to do the same but, just beacause someone @MONTH1 not like something does not mean their children or anyone else's childer will not eiuther"	3	3		3	2	3	2

4027	2	"I think certain books such as offensive books shouldn't be remove. I dont think so because that's how some kids learn better and read better. Kid's dont like reading boring books. Things like music, movies, and magazines are interesting to us.      If this world didn't have movies kids wouldn't read books. Most of these kids now a days read books because they watch the movie to the story. Some kids like listening to music while reading. I'm glade people invited these thing's. I feel like if people didn't invited these things this world would be boring.     Magazines are also great because they help people start to read books and so on. Magazines are entataining to people. I say they are because they have pictures, glossip, and much more. Magazines are good to read it help alot of people to read better.     It's also bad because kids read it and start doing what they say in the magazine. Some books are good some are bad. I say that because some books get out of control with cursin and the cover of the books well pictures. Some arthurs write good things and some write bad things.     Hope you get something out of what i wrote. This is how i feel about books, magazines, music, and movies. I love to read and listen to all of them. I enjoy books alot.

4028	2	"When @LOCATION2 was made and our fore fathers signed the constituition of the @LOCATION1, freedom was the big kahuna. With every signature endorsment added to the constituion, @LOCATION2 became one of the few countries with freedom in every right. Laws such as 'you are innocent until proven guilty' and freedom of speech have made our country stand out from other nations that suppress thier own people.Freedom is @LOCATION2's middle name and it is the birth right to our future!     Freedom of speech has been shown everywhere and even though some people's voices say a little too much it is still a right given to us so we must accept the nonsense that is said. Offensive things are common, since we are all differnt and the variety of ethnic groups in @LOCATION2 are so vast, that at one point in time someones toe are going to get seriously stepped on. This is not tolerated but still it goes on through the world. Freedom of speech is a unidentified form of express, since it is allowed to say what you feel but sometimes it is said to much and you end up in a fight.       Speech is still a freedom though, and if we cut out freedom we would be in a bad spot. Genocide, and inlawful inprisonment are two factors that happen regulary on account of no freedom. If you speak out against a powerful figure, you go to jail. If you belief in something differnt armys come and kill you, all because some country do not have freedom like @LOCATION2. This freedom might cause controversy and produce offensive products such as reading material and videos but its alot better than living under the shadow of a dictator.      Crude forms of freedom always end up on magazines, books, and cd's but if you think about it there being produced then they are being bought, or they would not be made at all. On certain occasions items are not being made for economical benefit but mearly on belief and religous values, that is also a freedom that many have paid with there life, to have. Also with the production of books, movies, and cd's you are protected from being exposed to points of view you do not like these things do have a rated supervision system, and if you do not like the product put it down and walk away, yes it is that easy.       I do not see freedom being thrown out the window anytime soon, we might just have to keep living with offensive products. We should all just be glad we live in afree society that lets us express our diffrence without being killed in the process. You cant just go take the constitution and disgard like trash so society will just have to bear the burden of expressed freedom. Freedom comes in disc and books but it is still @LOCATION2's middle name and the birth right to our future"	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
4030	2	"I believe that certain materials that seem offensive to certain people should stay on the shelves. I feel like as though its on that person whether they choose to read or listen to the material or not. I have also been in this position where I came cross an article that upset me. Also I have had an arguement once with someone who found what I was listening to was offensive to them.    Once when I was reading a paper on that was making fun of my town that I grew up in. The paper said how my town was filled with rednecks and that many people there were not very educated and not intelligent. This upest me and made me feel ashamed for living there. But I thought more and more that this article was someone elses opinion. That just because they wrote that article, doesn't make it true.    This arguement went out of hand. She had her opinion and I also had mine. My friend came by my house one day to hang out and do some homework. While we were in my room I turned on my favorite artists cd. I listened to rock music at the time and loved how talented the artist was. My friend went to my sterio and turned it off. She told me she didnt like it and that it was offensive music. So after that we pretty much argued the whole time. I finally said that I feel its great music and I shouldnt have to stop listening to it. We had a deal that while she was there I wouldnt listen to it, I felt I would respect her feelings.    Over the past years I have observed that more people are taking what others have to say or sing about to heart. When an author writes a story or an article, they are putting their opinion into it. Sometimes they are typing the facts and also what they feel is write to say. I mean if it is on the shelf and dislike it, dont pick it up and read it."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4034	2	"I believe certain materails such like books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive and are inappropiate.      Why I believe @CAPS1 is because there are things that are in these items that hurt people in many ways. But when the people make and read these items they dont know how effective it is to the people that are buying these items from the maker. I also had experience a offensive book and a inappropiate book.      When I went to a public libary I picked up @CAPS1 book and said too my self ' @CAPS1 might be a good book I can do for my book report' so as I picked up the book and flip threw the pages I saw words and images that offened me.there was words that where calling color people out by there names and pictures of the color women getting rape or abuse.      So I did not get that book I just put it back and was mad at the people that treated my culture wrong. So @CAPS1 white lady 'The libraryan' came up to me and asked me did I need help finding anything, but I did not answer her I just looked at her and shook my head.     As I walked threw the library I saw inappropiate books such as '@CAPS2 books' that these kids was looking at I could not believe what I was seeing. Becasue I think they should have these books some where else so that the younger kids will not get to these adult books including the music that always talk about @CAPS2, drugs, and gangs. Because I think these things are bad for the younger kids to be looking at or listing to because it can effect there futrure in life and also can cause violence, abuse, harrasment stuff that will get our younger childern in trouble as they get older.     I think all public libraries should have @CAPS1 type of stuff kept in a section for adults only and have to show some type of I.d to prove you are @NUM1 and older."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4039	2	"Ever went to the library and seen a book that was to graphic for a certain section. When little kids came into the library does it seem like they should stay away from that section. Well censorship should be in librarys now a days. Many children are seeing bad material at too young of an age.  Due to seeing this they @MONTH1 get bad ideas and possibly lead them the wrong way in life.     In librarys they have many books that are too mature for young children. They should have a restricted section in the librarys that only peolple of age or with parental guidance can pick books, movies, music, games, and magizenes from that section. For example, in video stores they have and adult section that only adults @MONTH1 enter not children. Librarys should be that same way but not with same material in video stores.     Personaly, I have seen children learning bad behaviors from video games, movies, and some books. While these children are young they do not know what is bad for them. So when these kids see the movie stars they envy and video games they enjoy harming other people they will pick up on the violence and do it themselves.     Librarys do need to take these books, movies, games, music, and magazines off of the shelves. If they do not then they should make a place children can not get ahold of these materals that can affect judgement. So when taking a younger child ta a library go in with and walk with them. It will save our kids of the next generation from violence and all other wrong doing habbits in these books, games, magazines, and music.     As long as there is not censorship in librarys our children will see these bahaviors and recreate them with other friends thinking thats its okay to do. Yes, once again I say censorship should be in librarys of any thing of certain age groups or if it is offencive. Do not let young kids walk alone in librarys so they can come across the wrong material for their age."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4045	2	"Most people consider libraries an unharmful place. However it's often found that some libraries have offensive books as well as magazines on it's shelves. Kids that are interested in reading can't be looking for a book and pick up a @CAPS1 novel with a nude lady on the cover. I do believe libraries need to have some sort of censorship on not only their shelves but computers and movies as well. Let me further explain to you the reasons why libraries should have such boundaries.     A library is a place to get away and explore your mind in a fascinating way; by reading books! Now would you want to be looking for one of your favorite books and find an offensive image? Nudity, cursing, and drugs are all offensive images I have seen in a library. It's not appealing to see an article about some sort of alcohol when its sitting right next to a kid's magazine. What kind of message are we trying to send to them? That it's ok to get drunk or have sex and read the magic school bus? I think there needs to be some kind of organization set up to go around and help censor libraries. Since the media controls the internet and most of the magazines, I think it would be a great idea to dispose of that in our libraries.     Libraries are a reading playground for not only our children but friends and family as well. We don't want our kids getting the wrong message when they go check a book out and pick out an autobiography on @PERSON1. Censorship does need to occur in our libraries and I believe it should happen soon. I'm not saying go and wipe out all the books you have already purchased at sometime because that's already in the past. No matter where you are you cannot escape offensive gestures; but please let's keep it out of the library."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4050	2	"Somethings on the shelfs in books stores and other places can be very offensive. I think having cuss words in music and sexualy things can be offensive to women. I do listen to some music but noting like that becasue I think it should not be in music and books. One day I Think the @CAPS1.S.A will be ran by a woman.      @CAPS3 is noting wrong with that. Woman have the same rights as @CAPS2 do. @CAPS3 is some people that think woman are just @CAPS3 slaves, that is dead wrong. Woman and @CAPS2 are the same no matter what people say.      Katherine Paterson as the right idea though. It would be great if the law would state that if you think something is offensive you should be able to take it off the shelf and throw it away, but some people would say other because @CAPS3 is some people out @CAPS3 who just care about them selfs and acted what ever way they want to so they can act or make them selfs feel better than they are. @CAPS3 are some kids who like to look and go though magazines and see all that bad thing they think that those people are cool so they teaches them how to acted and do bad things, That it why i think we should be able to take it off the shelfs     @CAPS3 was this one day I was in @CAPS4-mart just looking around and I saw a magazines with some movie star holding her three kids. The title of the magazine was superstar. It really hurt to see those three kids on the cover becasue one day they @MONTH1 not be like @CAPS3 parents and have all the money in the world.      It @MONTH1 seem really stupid these days that some people would care this much, I really think deep down that its life and we all need to get over our selfs becasue we can not all be right and have all the same feelings for life.          All my life I have thought about this subject cause it seems like now days its all about the money, what @CAPS3 wear and what type of car or truck they drive.

4053	2	"Coming from a teenager, @CAPS1 offensive books, magazines and movies should be removed from a local library. A library is a place to go relax and read. Most books and movies are filled with sex,gang violence, and drugs. In my generation sex, durgs and, gang violence seem to be high at risk everywhere. Books are suppose to be about learning. Offensive books and movies set bad habit on younger children.These are the reasons offensive books movies and also magazine should be removed from our local libraries.         Sex, gang violence, and drugs seem to appear everywhere in my generation. Whenever you open your magazine you find different topics, but they all deal with either sex, drugs, or violence. Children should never be exposed to that type of  offensive behavor. You should be able to open a magazine and   learn somthing brand new.    Books are good for reseach paper and other school project, but sometimes you cant find what you are looking for because of other topics. Reason you cant find what your looking for is because every book or magazine you look threw is covred with  the topic you dont want. As a teenager each book I look at its always about sex or gang violence.     If younger children, countiued to read about bad topics, it will create a bad habit on that child. They say you are involved  with what you read. Bad habit could lead to many things, such as killing, smoking , and pregnacy's. Thats why all parents should have guidence over there children.     Being who I am , there should never be any offensive books, movies, and magazine in a local library. Offensive books and movies can cause many problems. It drive children where they sont need to be, and you wont be able to learn if you have to many bad habit. there should only be book and movies where you a re able to learn something in your local library."	4	3		4	3	3	3																		
4055	2	"Most of us have had times when we are really into a book or magazine that we are reading, and all of a sudden we come across vulgar language, pictures, or activities that are not suitable for us. Why did the author have to throw this in the book? Why didn't the back of the book tell me that there was offensive behavior in this book? Why is this magazine in the library with risky pictures? It @MONTH1 even make some people not interested in that specific author anymore, or quite possibly persuade someone to stop visiting that library. Certain materials in libraries should be removed.     The first reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because it is not suitable for children or even young teenagers. Let's say your child is at the library and they pick up a random book to check it out. Turns out, the summary of the story on the back is actually about college kids partying and participating in illegal activities. Your child on the other hand, does not read the summary and just wants the book based on the moral of the story, interesting cover, and critic reviews. If your child reads that book with vulgar language and illegal activities, you are most likely going to be upset.     The second reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the books and other materials with offensive material can be placed in book stores, instead of the public library. In that case, parents can feel more content with having their children read any material at the library. Adults and older teenagers can still have their material choice, they will just have to take a trip to the bookstore to find what they need. They @MONTH1 not get to check out items for free like at the library, but it will be safer for the children and young teenagers. Not to mention, the people who respect their morals too much to read offensive material.     The third reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the library should be ordered to state on the back of the book, magazine, movies, etc., in any way they choose, if the book contains anything that @MONTH1 be taken as offensive to a reader. That way, if someone is questioning the summary of the book, a risky title, or cover illustration, they can flip to the back to see if it will be tolerable for them.     Libraries should remove certain materials from the shelves. It will create a more civil trip to the library. No more worries about accidentely coming upon a sentence or chapter in a book that is against someone's morals. Or flipping through pages in a magzine and seeing a picture that offends you. Libraries will contain safe books for all ages, while bookstores can have the pleasure of having offensive material on their shelves. It's a win win situation."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4066	2	"Libraries have books, magizines, movies, ect.The library is a wonderful place to read in a quite place.It can also be an offensive place to some people.They think they can complane and bikker about it, But should all those activities be removed from the library shelves? But whose oppenion is it anyways.          If I found an offensive book, movie, or magizine on a shelf at a library I would just leave it. Apparently its not a bad thing because if it was they wouldnt have it on a shelf. So if I got offensive by it I wouldnt look at it or pick it up. I mean its that simple.A library is full of well, about everything you would enjoy. Many diffrent people like diffrent books and movies to read and watch, that means the library has a right to put what ever they @MONTH1 want. Even if it is offensive to some people.           With my experences in a library nothing has came across to be offensive to me. Im a kind of person that dosen't care. However I have seeen so books ware the author is making fun of the @CAPS1 people. Also @CAPS2 seen a book ware the author is writting about the black people and how they used to be treated and some of the book has the @PERSON1 in it witch is a major racism to black people.                   It could be a unfair situation to some people that have kids with them and a inapropreate book is on the shelf and they see it. That could be offensive to the children and the parents .Or it could even be in a magizine. But why should the books magizines and ect.. be tooken off the shelfs when its not effensive to all people? If the libraians took all the offensive books off the shelves then there wouldn't be any left. Everyone has diffrent things that can offend them. If you dont like how the book is you can take it to your friend and they can read it or you can just turn it back into the library. You can also talk to the library manager and tell them the issue with the offensive it has given you.      Books, movies, magizines and ect are all in a library. They could be offensive or not. If you think they are then dont look at it or read it. Its that simple get it or dont"	3	3		3	2	2	2																		
4073	2	"I do not believe that people should be given the right to do that.  Just like Katherine Paterson had said, if people did away with everything that offended them, there would not be any books left for any of us.  Everyone has the choice whether they either want to read the book, or they do not.  If they do not want to, then they do not have to.  Just because one person does not like something does not mean that everybody else cannot either.       Honestly, there are some people who take offense to everything, and if they do not like the book or whatever it @MONTH1 be, they do not have to read it.  I find a lot of people to say things that offend me, but that does not mean that I have the right to make them stop talking.     However, I do agree that there should be certain standards set for some of the books out there.  Some books are too graphic for young children to read, and I think that one should have to be a certain age to be able to read them.  But, I do not think that just because they are graphic that they should be taken off the shelves.       Maybe the book gets a very delicate point across, like the book '@CAPS1', for example.  In this book, a young girl is raped very harshly.  But, the author did not write the book to tell everyone about her experience.  She wrote the book to explain that no matter what happens, there is always something that can help.  This book was a success story, and the graphic detail is there to show the agony the girl had went through.  Some might find this offensive, but most think that it is uplifting to know that they are not the only ones who have had it happen to them.     Books are not the only things that might offend some people.  In certain department stores, there @MONTH1 be a movie that has a line in it that I take offensively.  Does that give me the right to take it off of the shelf and demand that it be banned?  No, and why might that be?  Because I have a choice if I want to watch it or not.     Another place is the @CAPS2.  If you ask me, there are a lot more offensive things on the @CAPS2 then there are in books.  Kids can get on the @CAPS2 and stumble across things that they definitely should not see, so does that mean we should ban the @CAPS2?  No, because the @CAPS2 helps in a lot of ways too.  If I wanted to, I could find offense in everything that is in a library.  Books based on religion, or maybe a website based on a musician that had references to drugs in their lyrics.  I would be mad if I came to the library to listen to music and someone had removed them from the computer.  Maybe I do not like what they're listening to, but that does not mean I can do anything about it.         So, my opinion is that books, or anything else for that matter, should not be banned because someone didn't like what it contained.  Not everyone is going to like the same book, and that's why there is such a variety to choose from.  Libraries should not be told which books they can and cannot lend out.  After all, we are not forced to do anything.  All of us are different and we like different things, but we should accept the tastes of others as well as our own"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4074	2	"Books, music, and movies are being taken off of shelves around the globe, because they are found offensive.  Books, movies, and music were created for a reason.  It's a form of entertainment as well as to build knowledge.  Artists, authors and publishers release their work to get information out and to let others hear their voice, it is their freedom of speech.     Books, magazines, music, and movies should not be taken off of shelves if they are found offensive.  Censorship in libraries just hides certain things from society.  If all books on the @CAPS1 were banned and nobody could read them, nobody would be informed on the horrible event and it could easily be reincated.  The majority of movies and books have relevant information, portray events that could take, or have taken, place, and teach valuable lessons.     Artists and authors use their works to get points across to their audiences, whether it is a lesson or learning valubale or interesting information.  People shouldn't be allowed to just take things off of shelves like they are doing.  The material we read, music we listen to, and the movies we watch should be our decision to make.  It shouldn't be decided upon by others wanting to take it off of shelves.  If someone finds material offensive then they should take their own actions to benifit themselves such as, choosing not to expose themselves or their family to the material.  Banning things from the public takes away opprotunity for people to engage in things that interest them.     Some material could be banned for something as simple as one provocative word, sentence or even a thought.  The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4' had multiple occurances of cursing, but the book told a true story of an event that can happen to anyone.  It also indirectly included that families can be torn apart if you let them be, but the choice is yours and you can prevent it from happening.  Small things like such as language should not cause the material to be taken off of shelves where people who appreciate it cannot obtain it.     Katherine Paterson's quote is correct, if we can just take things off of shelves then there wouldn't be anything left for us.  Most materials contain something that someone isn't going to agree with, but if we just keep getting rid of things then what is the point in making new material.  There is always going to be the issue of finding offensive material, but nobody should have the right to ban it from everyone.     Materials around the globe are being taken off of shelves due to offensive material, but they were created for a reason.  Not only is it for entertainment,  but it is also for knowledge too.  Artists, authors, and publishers release their work to get information out to let others hear their voice, it is their freedom of speech."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4077	2	"To remove or not to remove     Should people be able to remove books that are offensive? I think so;it would help our kids and young adults, to read more educational books, rather than magazines and comics.     To start off with everyone has their own opinion of what is offensive ,and whats not. personally I don't think that we should remove books, because their offensive; I think we should just not let that perticular person not put out anymore books. But it's like I said everyone has their own opinion.     Secondly it's entirely up to the library where to place certien books with blood and gore,and if to have them or not. personally I like books with blood and gore; because it shows how the world auccualy is. It'snot like a book where you save the princess or damsel in destress.      Lastly if parents are conerned about offensive books don't let your kids get those kind of books give them a boring book. I mean we know the books that kids are not supposed to read but parents let kids read them.      In conclusion if you feel that a book is offensive do't pick it up, and don't have it taken off the shelf because there is always someone to disagree with yo"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4088	2	"It was during @CAPS1 class that we visited the library to look at various books. One of which, that my teacher picked up, was '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 Right @CAPS5' by @PERSON2. The book had been written during the cult of domesticity and was filled with ideas of the submissiveness of women and their devotion to the home. I found that book to be very offensive just because I was looking at it from a modern perspective. Nowadays it would be considered sexist to assume that women should stay home and take care of the house while men work outside of the home. Just because it was a piece of literature that I didn't agree with, doesn't mean that it's not a valued work. Certain materials should not be removed from the libraries if found offensive.          There is such a wide variety of people who search through the library, so finding a certain piece of material that not one person finds offensive is nearly impossible. Materials shouldn't be allowed to be censored for that reason. Materials found in the library are a form of expression to the individual who created them or to the society as a whole. Censoring those works would be considered a violation to the freedom of expression.      People of all ages look through the library to find books or music or magazines. Each of those people has a different belief. What is considered a work of art to one person could be seen as highly offensive to another. If  libraries were to start censoring their books, then the result would be a small selection of drab, emotionless materials. People visit the library to find materials that they are interested in, or look around to expand their interests. Libraries need to contain a wide variety of material to satisfy this knowledge.A library's job is to educate the people who enter it. A good form of education is the exposure to different types of material.      Sometimes the offending nature of a novel is what makes it good. It gets the reader thinking about what the author's purpose was. 'The @CAPS6 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON3 was seen as a very offensive work for a long period of time. It incorporated the issue of slavery when many people weren't ready to deal with it. As a result, that book was banned from libraries and schools. Now, it is seen as one of the most famous works in @CAPS7 literature. That example proves that material that's reguarded as offensive, shouldn't automatically have its value lowered.      'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' as said by Katherine Paterson, is an accurate depiction of the outcome of a library with censorship on its materials. Part of what make a good work great, is its ability to stir up controversy among its readers. Removing the controversy will remove an aspect of education along with it, which is essentially the main purpose of a library"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4089	2	"I think @CAPS4's ok to have books even if they are found offensive, because to some people those books aren't found offensive.                                                                                                     People shouldn't let what is in books bother them. The way I see @CAPS4 is, if the book offends you, then don't read @CAPS4. There is no reason to throw a big tantrum over a book, that to some people isn't offensive. I agree that books that are offensive are bad, but then again that's why you have the choice to @CAPS1 not open @CAPS4.     @CAPS4 would be easier to find certain things if we @CAPS1 had a library for everything. Like for instance, music. if we had a library for @CAPS1 music, @CAPS4 would be easier to narrow down things and find exactly what you are looking for. Same thing with movies and magazines. The only problem with this solution is the economic expenses.     Back to the point. I've never ran across an offensive book, and if I did, I would @CAPS1 simply put @CAPS4 back. Why take a good book to many people off the shelf @CAPS1 because one person might think @CAPS4's offensive? Most libraries have labels for certain books anyway. If you know what kind of book your looking for then @CAPS4 shouldn't be offensive.     Books are a good thing and aren't meant to be bad. Books are for entertainment and fun, and they shouldn't be found offensive. I've said @CAPS4 before, and I'll say @CAPS4 again. If you find a book offensive @CAPS1 put @CAPS4 back on the shelf and leave @CAPS4 be.     Music on the other hand, is offensive to many people. I mean, let's face @CAPS4, we all have a type of music we love and a type of music we hate. They're are a lot of offensive songs in the world, which I personally think shouldn't be around at all, and putting @CAPS4 in libraries is even worse. Music is a persuasive thing, and if a kid walks into a library and picks up an appealing @CAPS2, @CAPS4 could be bad. That @CAPS2 could have everything about doing drugs on @CAPS4, which persuades kids to do them, and no one wants their kids doing drugs.     I say that if you find anything offensive that should be taken out of libraries, @CAPS4's music, not books.     I've pretty much said all that has been needed to have been said. books are books, they're offensive to some people, and to some people, they're not. In the end, @CAPS4's all a matter of opinion"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4098	2	"I am writing this essay to puersuade the members of our local library to use better censorship when putting unfit material on the shelves for the members of our community to use. In this essay I will reflect my views of this subject, backed by true facts that I have learned from many passed experiences.     I believe that there is a large amount of reading material on the children section selves of our libraries that is far to advanced for many young children to understand. I myself have reviewed many of the books in the childrens section of many libraries. When doing so I noticed that many of the material makeing up this section is far to advanced or is to profound for children to absorb. Young children need to be reading more books of fantasy to allow them to use their imagiation more and not let their head be filled with thoughts of war and disaster. The children that read today need to have more material offered to them that they understand and not so much material that they can't comprehend. Lets use put more fit books on the selves of our library and quit wasteing our money on unfit books.     In reaching the conclusion of this article I hope that I have persueaded  the readers to understand the point I am trying to make. I hope my readers take the information I have givin and put it to work"	3	3		3	3	3	3

4128	2	"Have you ever came across offensive material inside a library? Well some people have and they think there should be  some type of censorship in libraires to protect the offended people . I do not agree with this idea because people should have the right to express their self through art, literature, and even music. After all the freedom of speech is written in our rights.       Many authors , artist and musicans have the freedom to express themselves through their work. If they saw their own work in a library being censored it would be very offensive to them. I understand that the artist's material could be offensive to certain people but it is their work ,a form of self expression. They do not publish their work to offend people , they do it for themselves and for other people to enjoy it. An artist's work is a part of who they are. A censor would just put a negative aspect to the art and literature of the library.     Over many years most libraries have devloped and arranged their media into a system called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. This system seperates all books, magazines, music, and movies into their own genres. For instince if you are looking for a mystery book , you would find it in the non fiction section. This system helps people find exactly what they are looking for. If people are offended by a certain genre they do not have to come in contact with it. This system is a better way to find exactly what you want instead of coming across a book or movie that you would find offensive. Almost every library uses this system so they do not have to use a censor.      Everywhere we go someone somewhere is going to find something offensive. It is basically part of our human nature. It is truly impossible to make every single person happy with everything in the world. In a library there will always be a book that someone disagrees with or someone will find it offensive. The author of that book and other people who enjoyed it  do not need to be punished by having the book taken off the shelves. Just because the book offends one person does not mean it has to be taken off the shelf or have a censor. If everytime that happend there would be no books left to read in our libraries. Most people would not even call that a library.      In the end a book is a book , music is music and we are not going to create censors or take books of the shelves because it is offensive to people. Authors write what they want to write , musicans play what they want to play, and actors act how they want to act. After everything  it does not matter what is offensive to people , they will just have to deal with it. There is no reason for a censor in a library"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4129	2	"'Everyone has @CAPS1 @CAPS2'     @CAPS3 is true that everyone has their own @CAPS2 and their likes and dislikes. For example, books. I do not like books that are about illegal substances, but I do believe removing certain materials that are offensive should not be removed from the shelves in the library. @CAPS3 is true that finding inappropriate book or an article @MONTH1 be disturbing to certain people, but @CAPS3 does not mean that everyone finds @CAPS3 offenive.     Once, my @CAPS4 class was assigned to do a book project. The main pourpose was to find a non-fiction book and create a powerpoint presentation on the main ideas of that book. One of the classmate read and had a breif presentaion over a book that was about illegal drugs. I know in fact that not many people are offended by the words such as 'drugs' or 'alchol', but I find these words to be obnoxious. While I found @CAPS3 disturbing and uncomfortable, others found @CAPS3 interesting. @CAPS3 was a topic that drew their attention, but not very appealing to me.     Another example would be the time I went to the library to write a research paper about the human body systems. My friend, @LOCATION1, found @CAPS3 disturbing to look at some pictures because @CAPS3 showed blood. Strangly, I never thought blood as anything disturbing. While @PERSON1 found @CAPS3 disgusting to look at, my head was in the book because @CAPS3 was fascinating. I always thought how the human body works is incredible. What @PERSON1 did was instead of trying to deal with the picture, she wondered off and tried to find another book that does not have any grotesque pictures. The book did not have any benefit to @LOCATION1, but because of that book, I received an 'A' on the research paper.     I believe @CAPS3 is important that people accept the fact that everyone does not have the same opinion. Every individual is different in their own way. As I mentioned before, the book that was disturbing to me was interesting to others and vice versa. That is normal and there is nothing we can do to change about @CAPS3. If permission were given to remove any certain materials that is offensive to each and every person, I guarentee that there would not be any material left on the shelves. I think the best way to solve this problem is for he/she to ignore the book that seems to be offensive and look for different material because others might need the resource"	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
4133	2	"With the world having a wide variation of cultures, languages, beliefs, and races, there is no doubt that different subjects will be offensive to some and not to others. Books, songs, magazines, and movies all have purposes as to why they were created. This @MONTH1 be to entertain, inform, or persuade. People use libraries as a source to see these works. Many people use libraries every day to research or simply to gain knowledge for fun. My opinion is that any type of material, no matter what it contains, should be able to be found on a library shelf. A library is a place where one should be able to find a book, cd, video, or magazine or any subject that interests them.     If our libraries took out every item that was offensive to someone, there would simply be no library. Any item you read or listen to will have a word, sentence, or meaning that will offend a person in some way. This is because many of the items you will find will be in some way biased. The way an author tries to entertain @MONTH1 offend you if they use a certain language with a certain tone. Persuasion is also biased towards one side and you @MONTH1 not agree with the side the author chooses. The same goes with informing. You @MONTH1 think the author needed to address a certain point more than he or she did. All of these purposes of writing will be offensive to someone. I once was in a library and read a magazine talking bad about teenage drivers. The article was obviously biased and did not have any teen sources to prove that not all teen drivers are bad. This article deeply offended me, but I am glad I read it and saw a different point of view. Not everyone wants to see the different points to a story, but if you happen to run across one of these items that offend you, you can simply put it back down on the shelf. You are not required to read or listen to any item that you do not want to see or hear. However, there is going to be someone who needs to use that item for personal knowledge or for research. This is why all items need to be available to the public. If someone does find an item offensive though, they should be able to request that a label be put on the item to further warn other readers. Likewise, if there is an item rated '@CAPS1' there needs to be an age limit set to protect our young readers and listeners. With these changes set, our libraries could make everyone happy.     With libraries being found in most communities, there is going to be discussion on the contents of the items they carry. While you @MONTH1 like a book, I @MONTH1 find it offensive. Even though I @MONTH1 have a problem with an item, it still needs to be able to be accessed by all people. The point of a library is to carry items which will benefit the public. It is the right of any human to be able to go to a library and be able to read about any subject he or she wants. Any item, whether biased or not, should be able to be found on the shelves of a library. Those who do not agree with or want to read an item should simply stay away from that section and choose a different item which interests him. We need to be able to go to a library and find what we need or want to see or hear. This is how a library serves a community"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4138	2	"What would you say if your library  was censored? Would you believe it would be right to have a censorship at the library? Well I am here to explain my belief's on censorship in the library.     My opinion is that there should be some items being censored, but we dont want to punish everybody just by taking the books off of the shelf completely. If i was an adult I would not want my child renting very graphic books, magazines, etc. but i wouldn't want to block his whole life. There can be different censorship on individual people too. An idea is to have a parent come in to decide what type of censorship you can put on a child by putting this on his or her library card.      The censorship would be a great way to help parents watch what their children are reading and watching. A good suggestion for this is what i just brought up, a personal censorship. This would keep the child from reading too graphic of novels for their age and it would not offense the parents. Also for the rated x magazines, movies, etc. i believe they shouldn't be took off the shelf and just moved to a different area that is secluded. This can be offensive to parents when they bring their children in, so move it to a place where children cannot have access to this area.     The censorship on books can also be completely outrageous too. Alot of books have graphic parts in them but yet are also a great read and can have great morals to learn. Graphic parts of the books are like the graphic parts of our lives, it's going to happen no matter what and we can't get away from it. Let the child, teenager, or whoever it is read the book if they are mature enough to read this and don't take it off the shelf. Just because it is offensive to some, others want to read the book too. You @MONTH1 please some with this idea but you will also anger others with this action.     Another point to get across is the library is also censored a little bit too. The libraries are organized into section by categories of books. Some books are categorized by the age level they are intended for. Once you get into the actual novels it isnt much like this but for younger ages this is the case, which people can see it work as a censor in ways. When you become to the higher reading level, you are most likely going to be old and mature enough to pick what you think is right to read and what is not.      With all this being said, there really doesnt need much censorship in libraries. Unless you have the personal censorship on the younger ones. There is no need to punish the ones that did absolutely nothing wrong to the community and to others when all they want to do is to simply check out items at the library"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4139	2	"Everywhere a person goes, there is always a media source. Media can range from newspapers, to magazines, to the radio, and through the television. Media is used to inform citizens of occuring events and to provide entertainment. Many media materials contain photos, langauge, and etc. that can be considered offensive to citizens. Media materials should not be taken off the shelf if they are found offensive.     In the @ORGANIZATION1, citizens have the freedom of speech. With censorship, authors, directors, singers and other producers are deprived of this right. If the government enforces the censorship law, people can not say what they want to or how they truly feel about a subject. Also with censorship, citizens are neglected of their right to watch and listen to what they choose to. Not everyone has the same opinion about what should and should not be blocked out of everyday media materials.     Parents and certain groups have a huge effect on the production of censorship. Parents and these groups complain that books, television, and other media materials are offensive and otherwise 'harmful' to their child, and that they should be removed from the media sources. I believe that if a parent has a concern with what his/her child is viewing, then they should take matters into their own hands by not letting the child view this material instead of having it censored so the rest of the people can not watch it. Parents and certain groups should not have the rest of the world be neglected of their choice to view these certain programs and read certain things.     Censorship can include anything from photos, to language, to news reports. People who believe that offensive material should be blocked out for young viewers and other people do not understand that at some point in a person's life they will encounter these materials. Sometimes, in order to understand a major world event, such as the death of @LOCATION2, have to understand the violence and forces that were used. If this material is taken offensively, no citizen will truly understand the real story and background of world-wide events.     Censorship effects everyone, from a small child to a grown adult. It can deprive people of certain knowledge and understanding of certain concepts. Censorship should not be allowed in the @LOCATION1 and other areas of the world due to the lack of a citizen's freedom of speech and the rights that we as citizens hold"	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
4142	2	Everyone has their favorite music they listen to or their favorite book to read even if it does offend a certain group or type of people. People do still read or listen to it. And the people who write the books or write the lyrics for a song are just expressing themselves. I believe that anything offfensive should'nt be censored because it's a way that people can express themselves.     I listen to music all the time as long a I like the way it sounds. It doesn't really matter to me what the lyrics say and im pretty sure that goes for alot of people. But there are some songs out there that people feel they can relate to so they actually listen to what the song is saying.     I don't really read alot because im picky about the books that I do read. That's not the case for everyone though. Alot of people like to read because it makes them feel like the book takes them to a different world. It's an escape for them from everyday life. Which I can understand why someone would want to escape.     Movies are like books but you get a visual of whats going on. Which makes it more entertaining than a book. So more people would rather watch a movie. But the movies don't have all the details that the book has so the books are more fulfilling. And just because someone doesn't like a movie doesn't mean that there isn't someone out there who does because there is.     So my conclusion is that everyone is different they like different things and dislike different things. But just because someone doesn't like something doesnt mean that someone else wont like it. Like i said everyone is different. So why can't the materials they read or watch be different as well?	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
4153	2	"I don't think that certain books or anything should be taken away because people like different stuff. Someone might have wanted to get that book. I don't think it would be right to take it away.      When I was in sixth grade, I was in a foster home that I hated. They would not let me listen to the music I liked. They thought it was bad for kids to listen to. All they wanted me to listen to was christian music and I did not like that.      My old foster parents used to try and take the stuff from me that they thought was the 'devil' in me. They would make me read the bible everynight. They tried to shove religion down my throat. I think maybe that is one reason I am not religious. They would not even let me listen to this one band because they had a song out about this girls husband having an affair on her.      Everyone should have their own opinion and be able to choose what they like or what they listen to or watch. When parents are that strict, it usually makes the kids want to do whatever they tell them not to do. If you don't let someone watch, listen to, or read what they want, then it might not be very easy for them to express themselves. They would not be able to show off what they really like. They would be doing something that they don't even like and That is not right. Everyone should be able to express themselves and what they like."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4165	2	"It is important to know what is going on or what has gone on in the world. If @CAPS1 is unaware, problems can only be helped to a short extent. There is a point in which words can turn into harrassment, but the boundaries before reaching that point can be fairly defended by the freedom of speech. @CAPS1 must learn in order to teach. @CAPS1 must teach for others to learn. Censorship in libraries is more offensive than the material that is hidden.Censorship should be prohibited because knowledge and time is all we have and everyone must receive and give respect.      If @CAPS1 were to look up information about the government on the internet, that person would not find a lot of useful information. It is a challenge to find why same-sex marriage is illegal in some areas or if the words on the news are true. In this generation, our species relies on cellphones, websites with recent dates, and the news. It seems that the time of research is diminishing. @CAPS1 can only learn so much from a world history textbook. It @MONTH1 not be completely accurate. The passing of the information from historian to historian over the centuries can potentially be described as the game telephone. With such a high risk of being mislead, the world needs as much information and thought as it can get. Knowledge, no matter the content, is valuable. It can help @CAPS1 to learn from mistakes and solve problems. The world cannot afford to censor. Censorship does not change the existence of that censored author's thoughts or the reality of what has occurred. The hidden information could be helpful. As this essay is being read, people are dying. It can easily be counted: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3. They are gone. At any moment, anyone and everyone could die. Time is mainly all we have. We need knowledge to make the most out of it.     Everyone deserves to be heard. If @CAPS1 were to refrain from listening when being spoken to, it would be disrespectful and offensive to the speaker. A lot of the people in underdeveloped countries go with their starving cries unheard. Such cries make the more fortunate, well-fed, and housed people such as myself uncomfortable. Despite such discomfort, this information should not be hidden from anyone. No matter how uncomfortable or offensive a material @MONTH1 be, perhaps the author is simply thinking for himself/herself. Perhaps the author does not find it offensive, and is simply trying to make sense of the world because that is all @CAPS1 can do with all of the problems that exist. Every single person has the right to be heard. The people that believe something should be censored or hidden could have completely different opinions from others. There is no absolute, divine being that can accurately judge a material. The people that censor could be wrong about the content of the material. Because of the great variety of opinions and concept of respect, everyone must be heard.     Censorship should not be allowed because time and knowledge are the valuable building blocks that determine the future of humanity and not a single thought should go unheard. Censorship is a great hindrance to knowing what is occurring and what has occurred in the world. Truth is knowledge and knowledge is truth. It is up to the world to unleash it and make something out of it."	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
4168	2	"This is a very difficult topic to argue with. In my opinion I believe that there should be certian types of censorship in the libraries. Eventually everyone is going to be exposed to the type of material in some of these books and etc. This material should be allowed in public libraries and highschool libraries, but of course you wouldn' want to see a highschool level of maturity in an elementary library.      Highschool students are more than likely to be exposed to inapropriate music and magazines than younger children. If they would like to listen to music that has inapropriate language then they should be allowed to. If there are young kids doing this it is obviously a bad thing because it is teaching them wrong things early in there life. It is even best if they arn't exposed to this at all.       There are also certian books in this world that are inapropriate to even highschool students and they need to stay out of all libraries so that there is no exposure. Once they are old enough to make their own choices then that is their decision on wether or not they want to look at those books. There are some things that can and can't be put out into liraries. Even you should know what belongs or doesn't.     So as I come to my conclusion, there should be things like music, books, and magazines but leave out the graphic material, children don't need to see that kind of stuff. It is all your own choice of things you want to read. Just make it the right choice, and understand what your reading, watchin, listening to, or being around."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4169	2	"Teachers in schools do their best to make sure the material that children and young adults read and see in school is appropriate for their certain age group. Parents also make the effort to censor what their kids read, watch, and listen to as a way of keeping them innocent. At a point in a young adults life, this feeling of censorship wears off, and the teenager decides to read, watch, and listen to whatever they want to. This is how it goes in most cases, but is this strong feeling of public censorship too old fashioned for todays society? In my opinion, yes. Censorship, to a certain extent, should not be in present in libraries.      There will always be something that one person finds in appropriate while another finds it to be perfectly fine. When I was younger we would sometimes watch movies in the after school program I attended. One movie, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 specifically, created conflict. While my mother was fine with me watching the movie, some of the other kids were not allowed to because their parents did not find the movie appropriate. Because of this one parent family all the kids in the program had to watch a differnt movie that everyone's parents were okay with. As @PERSON1 said eventually 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries restricted material based on what people found offensive, there would be nothing left; people can find offensive material in almost any material in this century. It is the way our culture is. I am not saying it is right, but someone else might think so and that person has a right to go to a library and get a book that they find perfectly fine.      In the @ORGANIZATION1 censorship has almost never been present. It is part of what is great about this country. People can speak, believe, and read what they want without the government interfering. This is not true in a lot of places and we should value that as @CAPS3, not complain about it. The government has no right constitutionally to censor material put in public, there can be age restrictions, but to completely cut the material out would go against this countrie's policy of freedom. I agree that age restrictions are okay, but I believe it is untimately up to the parents of a child what they want their child to watch or read.      Overall, the censorship issue is a little bit of a grey area. In my opinion our country is about freedom and censorship is not exactly upholding the constitution. People can believe what they want, but the issue will be hard to conclude. Everyone has a different view on something, that is what started this issue in the first place. When everyone learns to get along, maybe then can this problem be solved"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4171	2	"Today in our society many things can be taken in many different way. Many sayings, quotes and even just simple words are twisted, turned, and made into something they are not. The author Katherine Paterson once said that a person has a right to remove harmful things that explicit for children from a shelf, and this is true. Even with that being true, the question truly is, will it do you any good to take those things away? In my opinion offensive materials should not be removed because a librarian could be taking away material someone without money wanted, children--espcially teens--will almost do anything for what they want, and things have a double meaning most of the time.      If a librarian finds something offensive, he or she @MONTH1 not ever put that book on the shelf in fear of children finding the material. I think that action the librarian takes is completely unnecessary. He or she @MONTH1 be able to take that privelege away from his or her own library, but the material is still out there in the world. A child can simply go to another library, or even a store to find the same thing. I also believe that a library should leave the book on the shelf because what if an adult wants to read the book but does not have the opportunity to read it because it is found offensive.      Being a teenager myself, I have seen what lengths some people will go to just so they can get this explicit material. If a teen goes to a library and can not find what they want at that location, they will simply move on to another location. In even the most extreme cases, a teen will take their parent's credit card and purchase the item they desire online. In this case it would seem as if the library not having one thing because of something offensive, could cause a big catastrophe.      When a person listens to music, or reads a book, that person could take something differently from how the writer intended it to be. For example a person could take up a funny book that is finding funny things in everyone, but the reader could end up thinking the author was only making fun of one specific thing; something that reader could be involved in. Most songs nowadays have an excessive use of fowl language, but even then that language is not intended to be taken in the way some people take it. Everything in life can have a double meaning, which makes it easier to find offensive material.     These select few reasons are why censorship in libraries is unesscesary. The responsibility should not be put on the librarians, but on the parents if a librarian is concerned about a child finding unacceptable material. If the librarian does not like the material then he or she should not listen to or read it; however, that librarian should not take the privelege to listen to or read the material from other people. Katherine Paterson once said you can hope for a child not to find the material, and you can take it away, but then there is nothing left for the rest of the people. With this it shows that a person can not let one small thing ruin something for everyone else"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4180	2	"I believe that many books in our local libraries @MONTH1 come off as crude or offensive to many readers, but I also believe it has a lot to do with the maturity level of some people. For instance, if you are an adult you will most likely be looking in the adult section. There @MONTH1 be children who look through that same section, although their parents should be monitoring what they are checking out at their local libraries.              Although maturity has a lot to do with it, some young adult books probably aren't intended for the people reading them. Some young adult books @MONTH1 be venturing too far, and the children who are reading these books probably shouldn't be. I don't think that everyone should have access to check out whatever they want whenever they want. Many parents have different rules for their children then others, and they @MONTH1 not agree with what is displayed among these shelves for their child to checkout. I remember times when I was a little my parents didn't always let me check out what I wanted, because I was too young to be viewing it in the first place          As for adults, they are free to make their own choices on what to checkout. I don't think the adult section at the libraries should be monitored all that much, because as an adult you are free to make your own decisions. You know whats right and whats wrong, and no one person should have to tell you what you should or shouldn't be reading.     The area that I would be most concerned with would be the young adult section. At that point children are at an awkward growing stage were they themselves are still learning whats right and wrong. Some books or movies could effect the young viewers dramatically. Their parents @MONTH1 be letting them watch horrific movies, and it could make them feel as if what they're watching is really okay. I think parents should be very involved in their children's lives, and closely monitor what their children are reading or watching.     I do feel that some books should be monitored, and taken off the shelves if they are found inappropriate for the intended age. Mostly in the children and young adult sections, because they could be taking in information they shouldn't be. I also feel that parents should take a part in their childs life, and set limits to what their child is aloud viewing. Above all, I think that everyone should check out books in their appropriate age section"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4190	2	"@CAPS1 us? @CAPS1 now? Those questions just might be flashing through your head right now.  The reason @CAPS1 I am writing to you today is to give you my point of view on the censorship in the worlds libraries today.  In this context hopefully I will be able to enlighten you on the subject, also with the questions of '@CAPS1 us?', and '@CAPS1 now?'.     Censorship, what does that mean to you?  To me that means censoring many things in the world to protect it from children who are under the age, not people who are old enough to handle inapropiate things.  In todays libraries there are many uncensored things, that happen to be in the adult section of the libraries.  Things such as books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the adult section, also labeled as the uncensored section, if that is where they rightfully belong.  Now you are probably wondering, @CAPS1 us.     In today's world many people want to protect their children from harmful things, such as uncensored materials. @CAPS1 us?  In the world today there are so many laws, regulations, and even authorities protecting our rights. Now many people want to try to get around the government protecting our rights.  Many want to protect their youth from some of the so called 'harmful' things in society.  Today you can try to create a law or bill that @MONTH1 make it through the government, now some of them are trying to remove the uncensored material.         @CAPS1 now?  Throught the years the world has changed, everything has become easier to have access to.  Now one thing they think they @MONTH1 be able to do is remove the adult section of the libraries if enough people stand to fight for it, it will not happen.  There is an adult section for adults not children, people need to realize that.       In the end, the adult section needs to stay in our libraries. Some of the material in the section is not always bad, sometimes it contains material over war, and recessions.  When people are of age they are allowed to enter the areas, not any younger.  Don't punish the rest of the world for one libraries mistake of letting children have access to adult material, make the children realize it wasn't their area to be in.  Then many parents @MONTH1 see it's not just some of the world, that the whole world is exactly the same way. The books, music, magazines, and etc., need to stay where they are"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4192	2	"I believe books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. should be removed from the lilbrary if they are offensive. Some peole take things wrong and lilbraries could have issuses. Also keeps customers happy and it will get ou more guests daily. Lastly, it might let someone feel better about themselves.   First, some people will take things wrong and lilbraries will have issuses. If someone comes into the lilbray in feel its something in the lilbrary that is offensive you can get a lawsuite. Also it could set off anyones mind to feel disrepsected and feel they dnt have to respect the lilbrary because the library isnt respecting them. It can cause plan in someones eyes by making them feel like they arent equal around other people.   Second, it keeps customers happy. If a customer feel that they see something offensive and the lilbrary discards of the object it will make them feel that you respect them. If you keep offensive things in a llbray less people will cum to the lilbrary if they feel they are offended and have no say in if it should be removed. The more people feel home bond the more they will come.   Next, it might let someone feel better. If you walked into the lilbrary and seen something you didnt like in there you would want it removed too. If it didnt get removed you would feel that you are not respected and you will feel not wanted. Lets say someone see something offensive and the lilbrary doesnt remove it and the person took a book out the lilbrary, then never returned it you would lose money because you would have to get new books in stock.   In @CAPS1, there are many ways to resolve problems and resolve issuses without conflict. You can disrespect someone and they might disrespect you back, but when it all come down to it you have to give repsect to get it. somethings help people feel better about themselves and keep there day goin. So before you make your decision thing would you want it done to you"	4	3		4	3	3	3																		
4195	2	"There are many forms of entertainment in the world today.  Almost anyone has access to movies, magazines, newspapers, music, books, television and radio.  While these examples @MONTH1 seem relatively innocent, there are many cases where they can be found very offensive.  When the book, magazine or movie was create, it @MONTH1 not have been made to be offensive.  A group of people @MONTH1 find something very offensive that most other people wouldn't even think about.  There are many types of consumers and it is hard not to offend anyone due to the wide variety of people.  Certain materials, such as books, music, movies or magazines should not be removed from the shelves, even if they are found offensive.     The act of censorship in libraries, or anywhere, should be looked down upon.  No one is being forced to read a book or magazine, watch a movie or listen to music.  If someone finds a book offensive, then the solution is simple: don't read it.  Others @MONTH1 find the book to be inspirational and uplifting, and taking the option of reading it away from the person is wrong.  There are many forms of entertainment that could be taken the wrong way and be offensive to people.  To take away any book or magazine that could be offensive to any group of people would be a large task.  Taking away all offensive books would do away with a large portion of books available in libraries.  If a person doesn't want to read a book because of the offensive nature of the book, then he can leave it on the shelf and pick a different book.  The book should not be taken away from other people just because someone @MONTH1 be offended by it.     Everyone has a different view on things.  Many people @MONTH1 think one way about something, while other people think of it completely different.  This is why all different forms of books, magazines, radio and music could be offensive to people.  For example, a person @MONTH1 be offended if a book talks about a certain topic while another person thinks nothing of it and reads on.  This person @MONTH1 enjoy the book and pass it on for others to enjoy.  If it was taken off the shelves because it offended the first person, no one would have the option of enjoying it.  Just because something is offensive to one person, does not mean it is offensive to everyone.     I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong.  There are many personal reasons why someone @MONTH1 be offended by something, but that doesnt mean it should be taken away from the general public.  People @MONTH1 miss out of a very good book or movie if it is removed from the shelves due to someone being offended by it.  If a person finds a book, for example, to be offensive, they can easily stop reading the book and pick another one.  No one is forcing them to read something they don't want to.  Also, the book @MONTH1 be very enlightening to another person, and removing it completely would be unfair to them. Censoring the content in libraries is wrong."	4	4		4	4	4	4

4213	2	"Culture and history are two very important aspects of the world. Liraries are placs that house these very things for the enjoyment of all who visit them. This is why i believe libraries should not censor any of their materials. Learning has always been and will be a key aspect of living and libraies offer this to people freely! How can one take that freedom away from another?    Not all things in the world and history are perfect and have occured in the ideal way. However, subjects such as slavery, the @CAPS1, and other controversial topics must be known about. These horrible happenings @MONTH1 offend some but they cannot be erased from the past. Learning is natural to humans yet we always try to fight it. It is not right to hide the truth.    Some people are easily offended and some are not. But the true question is,'who is to say what is offensive?'. There are people who believe that discussing @CAPS2 in the christian religion is offnsive and others who believe any type of homosexuality is also. Yet there are still others whose believes directly contradict these. Libraries must maintain all types of material becuase their purpose is to hold knowledge and not just what people want to know.    How can we make better decisions in the future if we do not recognize what has occured in the past? Removing information from the library because it is offensive is essentially depriving people solutions to problems. All aspects of culture and history should be preserved so that we can know where we came from, the mistakes we made, and how we plan to fix our new ones! History has never been in the control of man.    In conclusion, libraries should not censor any of their materials. What has happened in the past cannot be changed or altered to fit our ideal visions. And by doing this we deprive future generations of information that could potentially be useful. We must never forget who we are as a people, and where we came from. Our knowledge and ability to learn is our greatest asset and must be treasured."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4214	2	"People of all ages have the right to read any material that they want @CAPS1 or other family members @MONTH1 tell their children not to read about a certain topic. Those children will either listen to their @CAPS1 or not. If these children do not listen, we need to do something about it. We need to have rules in libraries. Children do not need bad influences in thier lives.Adults have the right to keep children away from this information.     Leaders of a library have many different sections in their library. Children and adults both have thier own sections as well as teens. These groups of people have a right to choose what material it is that they want to read, watch, or listen to. I believe that if we make the sections have an age limit we can prevent children from finding bad information. Right now, children can read this information at any time. Adults can eliminate it.     Children in libraries should be supervized. Too many books are about drugs, sex, or pregnancy. Reading this material @MONTH1 give off bad information to a child. Children are not old enough to be learning about sex. @CAPS1 should be the first to tell thier child about sex. Young children know about drugs and know that those drugs are harmful. Children learn about drugs in movies, books, and can hear about them in music. Many books deal with pregnacy as well. Learning about pregnancy make them think how that women got pregnant with a child. Those children then start to ask other adults and children.      Children can also read or listen about gun violence. Children read about gangs and think that it is cool. They then want to play with toy guns and pretend that they are in a gang. This information is very harmful and should not be allowed to children. After some children read about it they get thier friends involved. This information can spread across the school. Violence is very harmful for children.     Librarians are not in control of the material people wish to read. If that library has offensive material it is their job not to let that material get into a young persons hands. They should be able to have strict limits on age apropriate material. If a child tries to check out a book and it seems to be over their age limit, they should not be allowed to have the book. The sections that they @MONTH1 find harmful information should be closed to young children. Children in libraries should be supervized. Books about drugs, sex, or pregnacy @MONTH1 not be allowed for children to read. Violence in books seem to spread across schools. Adults can help prevent harmful information from all children."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4217	2	"Censorship is the most foul and terrifying part of society.  Our lives have been taken over by politcal correctness, so much so that our voices are no longer our own.  Until recently we had the freedom to convey our thoughts, no matter what those thoughts were, in any form of media.  But now if something is found to be offensive in any way it is essentially burned.  Censorship limits our freedoms, takes away our @CAPS2 as citizens and people, shields us from the truths of the world, and limits the knowledge we can take from, as well as ensuring that one day there will be nothing left of media.     The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, the document that our country lives by, says that we as people have the right of free speech.  Censorship actively and violently violates that right.  Our country was built on free speech, and now it is being taken away.  Our own words forced down our throats, never allowed to come out.  Censorship ensures that no opinions will be heard, that no one's beliefs will be questioned, that no one can assume or think for themselves.  Is this not what we are supposedly guaranteed by freedom of speech?  We are supposed to be able to say anything we want to say.  We know there are consequences for saying certain things, but we are supposed to be allowed to say them.  Letting our own ideas into the world allows for new ideas to form.  Arguements come, but these arguements allow people to see other ideas that they hadn't thought of and look at issues from new perspectives.  We are able to see our world through different eyes when we hear or read someone else's opinions.  And from there we can form our own opinions, allowing our world to be rich with iddeas and knowledge, and allowing our society to advance.  But censorship wants to take this all away from us in order to please everyone.  But there will always be someone who is unhappy.  It's the inevitable truth.     Censorship is trying to shield us from the ugliness of this world.  In a way this makes sense.  We don't want our children to understand the atrocities that happen in everyday life.  We don't want them knowing what's happening behind closed doors.  However, if we don't allow people to open these doors, they can never understand the world or be prepared for the experiences that are to come.  Learning the harsh realities of our society educates people, allowing them to stop these realities as well as be prepared for when they happen to them.  For example, let's look at the issue of rape.  Rape is a horrible thing, but it happens.  It is a nasty part of reality.  Rape can be censored from books, televsion, and other forms of media.  We can walk around pretending rape doesn't exist.  But that doesn't accomplish anything.  That doesn't get rid of rape.  It still exists.  And if the people are uneducated on the issue of rape, how will it ever stop?  How will a rape ever be able to be prevented?  How will someone know what to expect or what to do?  By censoring rape from media, we are ensuring that the people in future generations never learn about rape.  Knowledge of rape is important if it is ever going to be stopped.  Pretending something doesn't exist doesn't get rid of it.  Censorship is supposed to protect the people, but it doesn't.  It hurts the people, cutting off their access to knowledge.     We as people need knowledge.  We live off of knowledge.  And the way we obtain this knowledge is through media.  Censorship takes away pieces of knowledge gradually.  It @MONTH1 not seem like a lot is missing now, but as time goes on the gap will increase, and more knowledge will be taken from our grasp.  Is this fair?  Is this right?  Is this helping us?  How does cutting out knowledge ever help?  It brings us backwards in time, makes us fear.  It is human nature to fear the unknown.  The more that becomes unknown, the more we have to fear.  Censorship is taking away crucial pieces of knowledge that we must understand to get along in society.  This is wrong and immoral.  It is unfair, if nothing else.  We should be allowed to take from any knowledge that exists.  No good comes from hiding it.     Lastly, this gradual burning of knowledge is affecting society in horrid ways.  And as time goes on it can only get worse.  Censorship is based off of offensiveness.  If something could be offensive, it is disposed of.  However, everything that exists in society could be offensive to someone.  Therefore everything and everyone should be censored in order to fulfill the goal of censorship.  This means all media of any kind should be destroyed.  No one should say anything.  The world would be forced to be silent.  All knowledge would be taken away.  Chaos would ensue.  The people's freedom would be completely taken away.  The freedom to know would vaporize right in front of their eyes.  This is our future if we allow the censorship to continue.  We cannot allow our lives to be taken over by censorship.  Yes, people's feelings will be hurt, but we cannot rid our world of ideas and knowledge purely to spare feelings.  These ideas and knowledge are too important to let censorship take away.     Censorship is taking away our freedoms and @CAPS2, slowly stealing them away from us.  It also tries to shield us from reality, but instead hurts us, ensuring that we will never understand our world and never be able to stop the very things that are being censored.  Censorship is affecting society, ensuring that our freedoms are to be taken away.  All knowledge will be trashed and no one will be able to voice their opinions.  A very dark future waits for us if censorship continues.  Only by helping people to understand censorship and the wrong it does to society can we gain back our freedom of speech; the freedom we are supposedly guaranteed, but censorship is desperately trying to take away."	6	6		6	4	4	4																		
4232	2	"When you go into a library have you ever seen the many subjects people write about? Some from their own experience and some made up. I personally disagree that offensive books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed. The authors or producer of these sort of entertainment were made to be read, hear or watched by people that are interested in them! Also if the libraries are having diffculties with the complainments towards the offensive materials they should just make a separate section.     To begin with, why are books, music, movies, and magazines produced for? Easy one! To entertain us; to expand our knowledge on things; to let us have intrest. If none of these things were invented, life would be boring, now i'm not saying we need these offensive materials, i'm saying it's there so we can think bigger about topics instead of them same-o-same-o. Producer produced 'offensive' material to catch attention and to be read, not so they can sit on the far back of library where nobody goes just because it has some things others @MONTH1 not like. If you don't like those type of things, stay away from them, don't bother reading or listening to them! Why should libraries stop the people that made those things from making money? Does that seem right to you? It's bad enough they're sencond guessing if they're good enough to be shelve worthy. There's many books out there that are horible and a waste of time reading it, so should they be removed to? Think about that one.     Secondly, I disagree with the removal of these type of materials because libraries could always make a separate section. It @MONTH1 cost money, but what's more better loosing tons of costermers or finding extra room? Libraries are very big already and i'm sure they could find a little bit more room, they separate everything into genres already.     Although I see where others come from about removing these kinds of  materials from shelves. There @MONTH1 be some cautious parents that don't want their children exposed to that sort of stuff. Teenagers especially, they @MONTH1 get ideas of the language and scenes from these sort of stuff. I once read a story about a man that read a book one of his old pals from college wrote about killing women and teering there inside out, this man got a idea to do it to his mother. He beat his mom and cut her body open, leaving the insides on the outside lawn. The man is in jail now and the book was removed from shelves. Still I don't think it should have been removed because an imature, ignorate person thought it would be cool to do it. The book was made up and the guy was most likely dellusional and sick in the head to do it. And because of his actions and author has to suffer from money lost and big waste of his time and effort he put into it.     In conclusion no type of material should be removed because it has been found offensive. Some people just have ignorance to not understand the books, music or movies was made for entertainment for those who like that kind of stuff exposed. Like i've said recently it was made to be either read; heard; or watched. A separate section would be a great idea."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4233	2	"All terms of offense are based on an opinion. If one person finds a particular word offensive, doesn't mean the next guy will feel the same way. Some parents aren't as strict on there kids as others, and some just dont care.      Of course there's always that gangster rap that talks about drugs and women being objectified that kids really dont need to belistening to. The horror movies that are rater ''@CAPS1' for a reason, they could have nightmare for weeks. Children's mental states aren't fully developed at a young age like ten. They still cant tell whats real and whats not. They need a trusted adult to rely on to tell them how to feel, to act, to do, even to think. Children just are't mature enough to handle a mojority of material in this world. No books should be taken away or hiddne fvrom society, it should just be given to you at your own disgression. Another possiblility would be have a group of many people gather and vote on age restrictions for particualr material. All information is helpful, just not all is necessary.     These days its hard to hide all harmful material from children, even some teenagers. This wolrd is becoming less and less sensitive everyday. Eventually everyone will be completly insensitive to all 'harmful' movies, books ,amgazines, @CAPS2 shows, and music. It wont even phase anyone anymore."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4236	2	To be honest if I was a librarian I would leave them up on the shelfs accoding to what @MONTH1 state law would have to say. If the state doesn't have any promblems with having them up on the shelfs then all student body will be able to check them out. having magazines shows whats new in the world and what is not. Also just like checking out a book how you have to take a test over it called reading counts. Then you would have to read an article from a page in the magazine and wright an essay over it and submit it to whom ever is in charge of that department.	2	2		2	2	2	2

4255	2	"Have you ever been reading something that made you mad? Well, to be honest I can't remember the last time I walk into a librarie and found something there that could had offended somebody. But thats just me, I'm sure that there is stuff out there that could really get to a person.      No, I don't that materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. People go to libraries to find out information on stuff that they don't know. If you are checking something out then you already know that there is a possibility of something that you don't agree with. I think it should be anybody business than the person checking it out.     Now, I'm not the type to get all frustrated or upset from something that I have seen on a shelve, but I could image that there are people out that are like that. If I had found something that I disagreed with I would not read it or just think nothing of it. I also think that you should be prepared before walking into a public place where they have all kinds of reading material. To you it @MONTH1 be offensive, but to others its hilarious.     All I'm trying to say just do'n get all upset over something that you have read."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4256	2	I believe books are writen for a reason and the words in the book goes with  the whole point of the book is the words in the book are ment to be in the book. But I am also the kind of person who sees words that are to offensive for people to read. But no by far I  think not letting people read the books that has offensive wording in it is kinda off silly because the author ment for it to be in there and if you change one word you kind of are changing the whole book and whats its trying to say.      But if some books are to offensive yes i believe it is good to not let people read but to take it off the market and exit the book and and try to resale it. But some people would be upset about the changes we make because they will think that the book is saying  something different but its not it is just worded differently. But i believe in both not to stop letting people reading them and for them to stay on market. Why I think its good to let books like this go on books that had offensive wording in it yes its worng but its also worng for the people who dont see it as being a offensive.     Am sure the author of any book that has offensive wording in it didnt mean for it to hurt you. Am i know in my heart that they are sorry for hurting you in anyway. But why I think they should stop is because some people would really have a hard time reading offensive wroding  it could be about  something that happend to them when they are little or just a word maybe they just dislike. But if they come across any word they dont like they  should stop reading.      I believe it is very unfare if they take a book away just because there might be one word someone dont like. But to others its does nothing to them. I think books that have a offensive wording should say somewhere like on the back of the book it should have a warning if it has any offensive working in it I think this would help out alot of people would start doing that.      This is really kind of silly because a book is a book and you should alway read about the story on the back of the book and if its a offensive and you dont like it that tells you not to buy the book. Dont always buy a book by the cover because the cover could be with flowers on the front of it and the book might not be about flowers at all.     I really feel like am on both sides	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4258	2	"I think that no @CAPS1, Book, @CAPS2, or any sort of music should ever be takin off the shelf, if u dont like what they say in these @NUM1 catagories dnt wach listen read or anything.  Just because u dont like it doesnt meen somebody else doesnt.  I mean think about it is there a @CAPS1 or a song or a sintance thats so terrible that you need to take it off the shelf i say no.  Also beacuse somebody might have not got to read see or listen to that @CAPS1 song or book ya no what i mean.  Plus all that money and time and hard work it took to make the song, book or @CAPS1 it takes up to like almost @NUM2 years for a @CAPS1 to come out and when a song comes out u hardly even no its new because they never tell you like listen to bullet for my valentin's new song on @NUM3 or anything and when a new book comes out it's usually like harry potter or somthing like that but no, no @CAPS1 should ever be takin off the shelf's nor book nor music nor magizine.                                                                                                          @ORGANIZATION1"	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
4266	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,           I have been through some different libraries lately to see what other kind of information they had. I am also afraid to tell you that i have seen a censorship problem with our public libraries. I can understand why they might censor some of the more mature/graphic novels because of the children going in and out of the library all day, but, i do not believe that everyone else shouldnt be able to get the books they want because of content issues.One reason why i think there shouldnt be censorship in libraries is because some people need to find information on certain topics and there might not be any reliable information on it on the internet.if students in highschool or college dont have the information they need to write a paper or do a project for their classes then their grade could drop and also they could fall behind in work becauase theyre trying to catch up to where everybody else in their class are working.Another reason I think censorship in our libraries is because some of the things they censor could be the only copy of the book or the only one thats close to where you live. If they censor the one book that you need then that could possibly ruin the whole book for them. I believe that if a person is over the age of @NUM1, they should be able to take out any book they want and have it be uncensored. some people @MONTH1 take offense to some things written in these books, but if they dont like something, they shouldnt check it out in the first place.There are plenty of people around this world that have interest in millions apon millions of different topics. Also, some people @MONTH1 not be able to reasearch or explore their topics as much as they would like to because of the censorship problem in public libraries.if people could learn more about their interests they could go on to bigger and better things or maybe even just get a little bit smarter.In conclusion, I believe that censorship in libraries should be banned because of the problems it can cause and the effect it has on people. Censorship is a problem that needs to be dealt with as quickly and effecintly as possible."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4272	2	"Do I believe that certain materials, suck as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No I do not believe this statement for many reasons. If anybody cold take books off the shelves in the libraries, there would no longer be any use for libraries, students in school will have a harder time learning about certian topics in the world, it would defeat the purpus of having the ability of freedom of speech, we could easily avoid this problem if needed.     One reason I believe that taking books off the shelves is because, if we all have the right to take books we find offensive there would no longer be any books no the shelves. This would limit us the ability for students to learn about many important topics in the world. Just the other day I heard a lady telling her daughter that she was not going to allow her to go to school the day they have 'the talk', (sex education for students in grade six), because she thought she was too young to learn about that area of education. Yes, that @MONTH1 be true, but it also means that her daughter is not going to know about the many diseases you can get from underage, and or unpretected sex. This @MONTH1 lead her daughter to having sex at a young age and getting pregnate, or some kind of disease, that could have easily been prevented with a little education from library books, or a class at school.     Another reason I do not believe in the right of taking books from the shelves is because, when we are taking these books off the shelves, we are taking someones very hard work and just throwing it into the trash. In my opinion it is very disrespectful to the authors, and anybody else who was involved in writing those books. Just because you do not agree with what they are writing does not mean you can just throw it away. This would being defeating the purpose of haveing freedom of speech. Taking those books off the shelves is basically telling the authors that they are not aloud to write about what they want and publish it. It is also telling them that they are not allow to state thier oppinion.     This problem could easily be avoided if needed. For example, those books, music pieces, movies, magizines, etc., could be put in a seprate section of the library, and only make it availble to adults of a certain age. Have the books, and other writing pieces rated in the same way that movies are. This would be a very simple and effective way to solve this problem.     Like I mentioned earlier I strongly disagree with giving citizens the right to take certain materials, suck as books, movies, music, magazines, ect., off the shelves if you or anyone else find them offensive. It could effect the community in many ways, it is very rude and disrespectful to the autor of that piece of writing, and there are simple solutions to this problem"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4273	2	"Yes, I believe that books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed off the shelf if they are offensive and inappropriate.       People should have the freedom of speech but not in an offensive manner.  If people want to have heir things shown such, as movies or heard, such as music, it should be appropriate.  Just because other people are doing it doesn't make it right.  Some people have little sense of knowledge not to do the things that the movies, or songs say to do.  Most people like the songs because it says to do bad things, they just want to be heard, or want attention.  When I listened to music or watched movies, I got the same ideas as other kids my age and younger. I did stupid stuff because I thought that it was right.  People just want to get their voice out there, and to be heard.      I learned to get my voice heard, I needed to do it in an appropriate manner.  Some artists or actors don't want to convey these kinds of things to kids, but the only way to get there stuff out to the public is to make it offensive.     I stopped reading and watching this stuff because I learned the hard way, and the only way that I will be heard is to say and do the appropriate stuff. The way I look at things is @CAPS1 ( @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 Do)"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4277	2	"'The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2', 'The @CAPS3 @CAPS4', 'The @CAPS5 of @PERSON2'.  Do these titles sound familiar? They should, beause these are only a tiny fraction of the @CAPS3 literary masterpeices that people have enjoyed since their publications.  These wonderful books also share another characteristic, they have all been banned from certain libraries across the country and around the world.       When a child goes off to school ecah day, his or her parents are left to think that he or she will be getting a quality education that meets the stadards of their own core values and morals.  But certain parents @MONTH1 become outraged when they see the books shelved on schools library shelves that they see as wrong, and don't want their precious children exposed to such immoral concepts that go against their idea of what is right.  In all reality though, how is this helping anyone?     By keeping a student away from a book or subject, the person causing the censorship is limiting what that student can learn.  By censoring things people are not only kept from ideas that might shock them, but also from ideas that might make them think.  If a person cannot think for themselves, they cannot draw their own conclusions on things.  When one cannot think for oneself or make decisios for oneself, how can this person be considered a free individual.       Infamous dictators, such as @PERSON1, burned books to keep his citizens from thinking what he did not want them to think.  By banning a book in a school library, a parent is also keeping their child from thinking what they do not want them to think.  And when you want a book out of a shool library you are ot only keepig your child from reading this book, but everyone who goes to the school from reading the book. How is that fair?      So instead of wanting certain books to be off the shelves of your childs school, I say this.  Teach your children to be careful in what they read.  If you don't wan them to read 'The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2' tell them not to read that book.  Tell your children to follow the moral guidelines you want them to follow, and if certain books keep them from having their own thoughs instead of yours, just tell them not to look, and don't bother everyoe else about it"	4	3		4	3	3	3																		
4278	2	"Certain books should be removed from, the library because of the materials an  the stuff they show to younger children. One reason they should thake those books of is because some of the are racist against some cultures. Another reason is that some of the books or movies etc., would have things in them that young children shouldnt be looking at or reading. A final reason is that some books just shouldnt be in the librayies at all.     The first reason was that the books should be taken out of the library is because their racist. They should take them off because they can teach young children the wrong things. Also they can teach the children how to treat people different because their reading those books from hte library. They would also get  he wrong idea about peopple  and different cultures.     Second reason why they should get rid of that bad stuff in the libraries is because they would have things in their that young children should not be wacthing or reading. Like they shouldnt have movies with killing and drug dealing or about drinking or anything a child shouldnt be looking at. It gives the children the wrong idea and they will think its okay becasue they seen it in the movies or read it in a book.     Final reason is that they shouldnt just have those things in a library at all or should just have place for where the young kids cant use them. Or they would need a parent or sombody thats eightteen so they wouldnt be able to just get these bad books or movies.     In conclusion libraries shouldnt have books or music or magazines or movies in them at all. They give kids wrong ideas an make them think that its cool or the right thing to do cause they saw it in a movie or read it in a book. That doesnt make it the right thing to do thats why they should get rid of that stuff."	4	3		4	3	3	3																		
4281	2	"Corrupt Censorship     @CAPS1 @MONTH1 occur when censorship decides to remove or block; showing certain media or readable content all pertains to the creator. In some cases, the distributor and less the author, director, or publisher, has no opinion on whether to display the product they have made, but from their own habit of making what they enjoy; it is the will from the store, person or etc. to display these materials. Libraries have an exponential option to publicly put up on their shelves or stock, but restricting too graphic material is all depended on the eduacational rules the library is equipted with.          Any type of content is art, art that should never be even considered to be changed or enhanced because it pertains to one artist. You can never remake, rewrite or recreate that visual material provided from the creator. And you are not aloud to, unless given permission to from the creator. Censoring or removing on the other hand, is permitted to the distributor. Their choice to publicly demonstrate something made by someone is all their choice.     Libraries for example, show that any given media or readable content is publicly displayed for anyone to see, so long as the audience fits their rules or criterias. In some instances, partial side of the audience will run across unexpected media and will have the inexecptional pursuasion to accept what is demonstrated. Though it is not the creators fault to ensure where their content is diplayed, but the audience's fault in whether to see that material. It is choice to read or see whatever you'd like, you aren't forced upon to follow through to what the distributor-let alone the creator- is offering. Enjoying the topic or material is optional.   When you have options in front of you, any given topics or subject to read or follow, it it your will to chose to read or see them. Enjoying is even more harder, but when a library's limit is basically the sky, you should not force it on them to throw out the book just because the censorship isnt up to your level. It is not the library to blame, but your own. Everyone has different views on certain content and it isnt your obligation to view it.      When you take down materials @CAPS2 intended for those who chose to view and enjoy, you destroy not @CAPS2 art a creator has made, but the joy that filled a viewers taste. Libraries shouldnt exceptionalize for certain people's expectations because not everyone finds censorship a solution. Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so deos everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'"	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
4283	2	"Controversey and @CAPS1     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' (Katherine Paterson, Author.) Paterson makes a very valid point here. Right off the bat, I can think of many offensive or inappropriate books, movies, songs, and magazines. There are equal amounts of good and bad publications, and the decision of what is good or bad is very controvesial.     The creator of each song, movie, song, magazine, or any other publication has made their product for a specific customer. Playboy magazine was not created for five year olds, but for desparate sex-crazed men, and @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 wasn't made for adults, but for young kids. Usually, the intended purpose of the product is not meant to be negative.      It breaks my heart to hear of the rising amount of people of varrying ages getting into pornography. I think the whole idea of it is wrong, degrading, and uttterly disgusting, but others firmly disagree. Some religions think the @CAPS4 series is blasphemous evil, as others don't agree at all. Controversey fills everything in our culture. We all have our opinions and choices.      Should I have the right to take away books from my child? My mother would not let me read the @ORGANIZATION1 books when I was younger. She felt that it was from the devil and pure evil. That make me desire to read it even more than before. When I entered middle school, I read the books anyway: I had the ability to make my own choices. I didn't see the devil in the books. I actually felt the opposite feelings toward the book. The books reflected upon good vs. evil, which I saw as @CAPS5 vs. Satan. My opinions and views were very different than my mother's.     If I would have read the books when I was younger, I might've thought differently. I think that my mom protected me from what could have been bad. I think it is perfectly fine to protect your kids by setting up rules and boundaries. Parents just need to be aware that once the kids are older, they will make the choices on their own.      All in all, certain books will be in the kids section for a reason, and others will be in the adult section for other reasons. We must use our judgement and trust our kids to make good choices on what they allow to enter their brain and consume their thoughts."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4284	2	"No I @CAPS1 not believe there should be any censorship in libraries. We have freedom of speech for a reason.

4289	2	"As a small child I remember my mom reading me stories to put my to sleep. There was always one book that I remember the most named, 'A light in the @CAPS1' by @PERSON1. As i was walking into my public library the other day i was looking at the books that had been cenored because it encouraged, the following; mistreating parents, offensive language, bad habits, and other things. I was mad that this book had, essentally, been erased from all of children literature just because a few people @CAPS2 that it gives a bad message. Think about it though, when you are a child either having a book read to you, or reading one yourself do you honestly pay attention to such small details?    I do not think that books and music should not be censored, because society does a good job of thinking and figuring out what is acceptable and what is not. I understand the idea of warning labels, but i feel that censorship is too far. In the example I used in the paragraph above, that actually happened to me. So, i do not think that things should be censored just because a small group of people think that it is inappropriate. Even when i read that book today i do not see any of the reasons that were listed in the book. Therefor beleive that it was unjustly censored, meaning that a really good book will never reach the eyes and ears of child that deserve to hear and read it.     Over the years many things have been censored, some had an actual reason, others maybe were looked at and censored because somebody did not like how they read the book. the point is, is that people should have a choice of what they can get from their public or school library. Maybe, they should just give an idea saying that there is potentailly inapprapriate materail in that certain book and should not be read to or by a certain age group. when you look back to your childhood and think of all the books that were read to you that you enjoyed, how many of those books have been cesored for reasons that make no sense? That is the primary reason why I believe there should not be any censorship"	4	4		4	3	3	3

There are kids sections, adult, fiction, and many more. Just like any ordinary store, there are items in a library that are not subject for children. A common question has been coming up everday life, 'Should we remove these offensive items from our shelves?'                                               Libraries have been around for years and so have uncensored things that are being put in front of children. As a child, you want to explore and know everything. Bad things will always be put in front of you as an obstacle to make the right choice. Just like these degrading items found in everyday stores, libraries, or in general everywhere you go. A library, however, is not just intended for adults, teenagers, or young children. A library is made for everyone's access and not everyone is alike. Therefore there is plenty of variety in these libraries. It should never be a libraries fault for containing things not appropriete for children in my belief. Almost every library is very organized into categories. If children are separated and exclusive to adult material, I see no problem in having these items on the shelves. When I visit a library, these items are very out of reach for children. Society knows what should and should not be brought upon a child, so they know not to put it in any reach of children.                                           'All of us can think of a book that we hope non of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' said Author, Katherine Paterson. Katherine makes a very valid statement. If I have a child one day, I could think of plenty of materials I would hope my child never came acrossed. However, as a parent it is their job to protect their children from these things. Coming from a teenage perspective, at a young age, I was very clueless about all the terrible things sitting around me. A majority of children would not be able to get their hands on such uncensored items, nor would they understand them if they did.                                                         There are things in this world that are much worse for children to see then taking a quick glance at something not for their age at a library. If anything, concerned parents should be paying more attention to what their children come in contact with at stores, the people they are around, or what they are listening/watching. The internet is probably the most uncensored place a child can come acrossed. Reaching out to libraries about what they put on their shelves should be of their least concern compared to what is really out there in life.               I do believe that no children should be handed or put in front of uncensored adult conduct because one-hundred percent unacceptable. If these items were placed in spots where only adults can get ahold of, then I see no problem in the situation. The children of our generation and more to come will always encounter something they should not be put in fron of. However, that is life and there will always be something come up in your life that you should not witness or be apart of. If libraries continue to keep these items out of reach of children, then there should be no censorship in libraries."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4298	2	"In @LOCATION1, people like to do many dfferent things for fun. Some like to go to movies. Others perfer a nice walk through the park. Now a days everyone is all stuck up and think that we should not see and or read bad, nasty, offensive things. I believe that we should be able to see what ever we want.          The first reason we should be able to read what ever we want is because we have the right to. There are lots of things that we cant do but reading should not be one of those things. We shouldnt have to ask some one if a book is ok to read or not. Its not fair to those who want to read it. I find it very dumb.     The second reason we should be able to read what ever we want is because if you dont like it, dont read it. This is a very simple an straight forward concept. Everybody today is worried about what everyone else is doing. If yo dont like something then dont pick it up and read it. If i knew there was a boook that i didnt like because it was offensive to me, i wouldnt read it. Its just that easy.     The third and final reason why we should be able to read what ever we want is because its none of your bussines what other people do or read. Everbody today is so worried about the next guy that its not even funny. If we all just worried about our selfs, then we would be better off. If i read a book that i found offensive or bad, i wouldnt go around telling others its a bad book and that is should be pulled off the shelfs. Its not right and its not fair.          We should be able to read what ever we want. Its our right to read it. Also, if you dont like it, then dont read it. People today are too worried about other people. If other people want to read a book that you find offensive or bad, there is nothing that you can do about it. That is the way life works."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4299	2	"If you take offense to certian things, you shouldn't read the peices of literature that make you feel like that. Ask some of your friends or research the book/magazine before you read it. Sometimes the front can be decieving so make sure you read the description first.     Many people that read certain things @MONTH1 take them the wrong way and think they say something they dont really mean. Which is why they take offense to it, but the more you understand a peice of literature the less you are offended. You should try to at least accept some of what the book/magazine says just incase you need it in the future.     You @MONTH1 get upset when you read something for the first time, and @MONTH1 not notice that it could help you when you think about it. Thinking about things is a great way to learn how to deal with being offended, just look from both points of view. They both could have good ideas and functions to them.     Try avoiding them if you are still offended by them, don't read a lot of book/magazines that have offensive things in them. Ignore the adds on the television or computers that have more than what you need to know in them or if they make you feel uncomfortable watching them. If you read them it could make you feel worse or make you mad. Sometimes they can even make you stess a little.     If you are really offended by something the best thing you could do is avoid it. Avoiding something helps you to not read them or think about them. This works for a lot of situations not just this one, so if you need to get away from the stress just ignore them."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4302	2	"The offensive things found in a library. In many libraries now a days there are all kinds of vilent and bad books talking about vilenst. Should libraries take these books, movies, or music off the shelfes find out.     The library should not have to take these tipes of things out of the library. If they have bad related books they should just make a different section in the library for them. For rated @CAPS1 movies they can have them in the library. You have to be over @NUM1 years of age. For music if it has an @CAPS2 sticker you have to be over @NUM2 to rent it. If the parents dont like it then dont get it.     They should make different sections in the library for the offensive books that they have. Kids under a surtain age should not be allowed to read the books. If they still want the book they have to get parents permissition to rent it.      Rated @CAPS1 movies they should be allowed in the library. You just have to be over @NUM1 to go in that area and with an adult. If you want to rent a movie you need to have parents permissition. You also have to watch this movie with an adult.     Music if it has an @CAPS2 sticker you have to be over @NUM2 to rent it. You can still rent it if your parents say its ok. They should make the @CAPS5 behind the counter. So that little kids can not see the front of the cases. If the parents dont like the libraries rules then dont rent anything from the library.     So dont take off the offensive books, movie, or @CAPS5. If you were head of the library what would you do. Take out the offensive things, or just put them in different sections"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4304	2	"In every school or library many people see books that are inappropriate for their taste. Everyone has their own opinion, and what might seem offensive to you, @MONTH1 be something that someone might want to know about. So should we take the books that only the majority of the people think are offensive off the shelves, or should we keep them anyways? Here is what I believe we should do.     Books are meant for learning and for pleasure not to try to offend anyone. They each have their own purpose and there was a reason for why they were written. There are tons of books out there that many people dont like, but that doesn't mean someone else doesn't. We should keep the books in the schools and in libraries, because @MONTH1 be they might help someone in a way and if they weren't there, how would that person get help if nothing else was avalible?      One thing we can do is categorize the books by the genre, so that way people know what they are looking for. Many people find these books that are 'offensive' because they come across them randomly. If each book was put into a certain category then that incedent wouldn't happen. It also helps keep everything organized that way. So when you go into the library you know what you are looking for, you can just go right to that section and not look at anything else that @MONTH1 be offensive to you.     Keeping books on shelves is what all libraries and schools intend to do. That is the main reason for libraries. They help you learn and get information about things that maybe you can't get anywhere else. If every library took off the books each person complained about what the point in having the library? There would be nothing left.      In all, everyone is entitled to their opinion and has a right to think that a book is offensive, but the reality is that it was written for a reason. If the library or the person who published it thought it was going to be a big deal, they probably wouldnt have put it out there for the world to see. So keeep the books on the shelves"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4305	2	"Going to the library is always a struggle when someone is faced with so many different genres of books. That isnt the only choice they are faced with either. There is music and magazines too. Just within the books, there are so many different subjects and catagories between kids books,  biographies, autobiographies, etc. On top of that there are alot of different types of music to fit everyones different styles. Some people might say that some of the books and/or music could be found offensive or not appropriate. But out of all the meterial in the library, I don't think there should be a problem with staying away from a the things that you might find offensive. Therefore I do not think that certain books or music should be kept away from the shelves due to a few self opinions.      There are multiple different books in a library and just because one might find one book offensive doesnt mean that the book should be pulled off the shelves. The reason being is that someone else could find that book as a good resource and @MONTH1 need it for something they are doing. People should know what they are looking for at the library and if they think that a book @MONTH1 be offensive then they could keep their self from checking out that book.      This problem is similar to others around the world. For example, when you go to the mall there are shops that you know you like and go to, and you stay away from the ones that you dont like or @MONTH1 find offensive due to the items they sell. That doesnt mean that store should be banned from the mall. Thats because some people might find that store interesting and want to purchase some of thier items. I think the same reasoning goes for different books and meterial at the library.     A way that a library could adress this problem with out pulling theses books from the shelves is maybe taking a survey from thier local visitors in thier town by asking them what they think on some of the different genres of books and different styles of music. After taking this survey the library then could seperate these items into different catagories or sections within the library. This could help this problem tremendously due to the fact people could stay away from those sections that they might find offensive and find what they are looking for alot easier.      I know when I sit down and read im not always caught reading the most popular subjects. I like to read subjects such as murder files, drug bust, biographies, and autobiographies. And then when it comes to music I listen to a wide variety of music such as hip-hop, country, alternative, rock, etc. Some people @MONTH1 find that wierd and unusual but it just goes to show that not everyone wants to read and listen to the same thing. Therefore the library should keep the wide selection of different meterial and keep everyone happy"	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
4310	2	I belive that there should be no censorship in the country of the free. In the country of the united states there should be no such thing as censorship. This country has the freedom of speech where we can say anything we want. This one band got banned in the united states of @LOCATION1 for there music. How can your music get banned in the land of the free. I think that there should be no way that any thing can banned in a liberary there should be no such thing. And how can we know good from bad if we never have seen bad. I know that there are some movies and magazines that parents dont want there children seeing. So dont censor it still have it just make it where you got to be a certain age to see that movie from a liberary. There should be no sensorship in the land of free speech. How would we be call the land of the free if we are censoring everything. That is why i dont think we should censor anything in @LOCATION1.	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
4315	2	"Personally in my opinion I have no problem with anything found in libraries today. Yes, there will always be something you disagree with, but it's not hurting you so just ignore it. Kids don't walk around in the adult section of the library they go to the kid section so there is no need to worry about them. Kids are maturing at a much younger age these days. I believe there is no harm in libraries, it is a place where you go to get all the information you can. So why would you remove valuable information. The library is a place for all people no matter who you are, how old or ugly. Everyone can use the library for any reason, many times invloving school. Personally I do not much use public libraries, but I often come to the school library to get stuff done or find a specific book. For example you might find @CAPS1 to be a horrible person that you don't want your kid knowing about. For me I am @CAPS2 I want to learn more about my own culture no matter of how bad it is. So why take that information away from me. Taking away a learning experience just becuase a group of people don't like the book does not mean everyone dosn't like it. I want to learn knowledge about myself and where I come from. Everyone is going to have their own views and beliefs. Overall think the library is not a place to take things away when any one is welcome. It is a place to get away from it all, I think they should leave them just how they are."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4317	2	"I beleive that all materials should be allowed in libraries, because we all have the right to choose what we want to read, listen to and watch. Even if people banned some books from the libray, other people would find a way to get them. we as the people of aAmerica have the right to live freely, which also includes the right to read freely.      As for music and movies i think we have let ourselves go a little too far. We have made pornography an easily obtainable thing, and music that promotes sex, drugs, violence, and alcohol. The only thing keeping us from pure evil is the @ORGANIZATION1 and their ratings on movies, music, and television.     With magazines its a little more complicated than the others, maga zines have their own set of standards. We all know about @CAPS1, @PERSON1, and @CAPS2, but think about all of the magazines that we dont see. The ones that stay behind closed doors and rarely ever come out."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4323	2	"Should there be cenorship in the Libraries or not? Many people have there own personal view on this subject. Everyone should know their own boundaries of what they know is appropriate to look at and what isn't. Libraries shouldn't have to remove books and etc. that they themselves have purchased to get. Now they want them cenored? i don't think that is very right.          Libraries should take all the cenored material and make a part of the library where the customers can't see from the main section and it would be open to the customers who would like to go in that specific section to check out a book or anything else that @MONTH1 apply to that section. The library was build for anyone who just wanted to go to a place to escape the troubles of their own world and just go sit in a library and read. Not everyone goes to the library for a book, some go to listen to music, some go to read a magazine, well whatever it is for the libraries can't take out the material that people go there just go get. How do they expect customers to come back if they're taking material out of the library? The internet and @CAPS1 is way more offensive than material in a library so what gives them the right to say get all your offensive inappropriate material out of the library. If libraries have to do that then so should all the other entertainment industries.     Finally every library should have their own control over what they think is best for their own facility. My opinion says we should just move the material else where in the building, in it's own little wing or something. Where people could if they would like to go in and check something out but if people didn't want to go in they sure don't have to. Everyone has thier own personal opinion on this subject, and well i gave you mine"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4324	2	"I think that any book or movie should have some warning sighns apon it, to insure that all peaople know what they are going to experience before reading or seeing anything. sSome movies or books read or watched, should have an age limit too. Some of the things people find offensive, other people @MONTH1 not and if taken all of the stuff out of movies or books @MONTH1 cause people not to go see or read as much movies or books.      In alot of music some things might be offensive, but if you don't apriciate what they say in the song then dont listen to that group. There are some rap artist that say some things people might not like but, you dont have to listen to them there are alot more bands and diffrent kinds of music to choose from. It would b hard taken stuff out of movies and music like that because it might take alot of what the people want to see.     In magazines alot of people including i like hearing the trooth about celebrities and interesting facts about people and movies, that alot of people @MONTH1 not know. If parents dont like there children reading those kinds of books have them go buy a set that they will enjoy haveing there kids read."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4327	2	"I think that @CAPS4 is fine if you take them out. Your should be @NUM1 or older to take them out of the libraries or stores if they are really that bad. If they are that bad they should have something on them like movies that are rated @CAPS1.     I have read some books that are really good,but kids shouldn't read them. I read this book @CAPS3 'A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' and @CAPS4 is really sad.@CAPS4's about this @CAPS2 and he tells us what his mom makes him do when he was little. I liked the book but @CAPS4 was sad,but I read @CAPS4 because people were talking about @CAPS4.     Some parents won't let their children watch certain things on the t.v. because they think that they are bad. I was watching this t.v. show at my grandma's house and she said that I shouldn't watch @CAPS4 but I do. I'm @NUM1 years old so I think I should be able to pick what I watch. I don't think she likes @CAPS4 because they yell a lot on the show and she says that is why I yell.     Some movies are better if they have bad things in them, @CAPS4 makes them funny sometimes and that is what everyone likes. I would rather watch a funny movie then a kid movie. I watched them before though"	2	2		2	3	2	3																		
4328	2	"No, the books and etc. should not be moved ,because anybody can be interested in them. Someone could come in the library looking for any of them items and can't find it because the library removed them.      First, there will be no reason for removing the books from the library unless more new books and etc. are coming in. Everyone is into different materials, books and stuff. That's why I say do not remove the items. People might come in the library looking for a book that they want. If that person can find it they might complain, or take there bussiness else where. Then the library could start losing bussiness.     Second, if they library start losing bussines it might be forced to close down.Then if the library close down the people who come there often won't have no place to study or work or nothing. What if those people don't have transportation they will not be able to get to another library. The owner of the library can lose money if it close down, because everyone don't have computer's and books at home. They can come do there research and rent books.     Third, some people go to the library for peace and quiet, and the library is there only place. Little children go to the library looking for books and etc. to and if they can't find the book they want they might start crying. If they start crying people who are working can be disturbed. Then that person or people who are disturbed might leave and never come back and thats money lost. Students school's might not have the book they are looking for, and they come to the library and the library don't have it that student won't have a book.     In conclusion, these are some reason and examples why I don't believe the books and etc. should be taken out of the library. Someone can be really interested in them items and they come to the library search for them and can't find them."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4332	2	"The library is a public place. Everyone is allowed acces to the library. It supplies everyday people with information that they are seeking to learn about. There are so many different forms of information and entertainment offered inside libraries. Books, music, movies, etc, they all can be found there. Since they all can be found, censorship in libraries should not be allowed.     Genres were created for a reason. Certain items have different forms to them. There are many forms of music. Classical, rock, and blues are some examples. Since music is categorized in such a way, there should  be no need for them not to be on the shelves at a library. If a certain type of music or book is known to be offensive, then that certain genre can be avoided. There is no need to even visit a section of the library if one knows that he or she finds it offensive.     In the @CAPS1 the @CAPS2 people are given many rights that are often taken for granted. The freedom of speech is one. It is a privilege that if taken away would tear @CAPS3 a part. The freedom to say what you please also includes singing. Certain music that is on the shelves at a library does have the right to be there. Just because a certain group of individuals finds the type of music offensive, does not mean everyone also thinks that way. For this reason any genre of music can sit on the shelves at a library.     Another freedom given to the @CAPS2 people is the freedom of press. Anything put onto paper is legal. Criticizing the government or fantasising about school, it is all legal. Books can be offensive to many people. They can persuade one in ways that is unbelievable. Like music, books have many categories. Whatever is put inside those books is allowed to be there no matter what.     Movies are located at libraries as well. They are categorized just as much as books and music. The term ' @CAPS5 judge a book by it's cover' is true sometimes. This can also be used with movies. The title of a moive or book will tell what it is about. Certain movies that are not meant to be seen by children are rated @CAPS6 or @NUM1. These ratings help censor things to a certain extent. It is not illegal for a library to have a rated @CAPS6 movie. It is illegal however to check one out to a child of a young age.     Censorship should not be allowed in libraries. All types of genres of all types of entertainment can be found in libraries. From books to videogames there are ratings and generes. If someone is offended by these types of entertainment they should not visit that section of the library. It is not illegal to have certain types of music, books, movies, etc inside a library. As long as no laws are being broken, there should be no problem."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4334	2	"Do I think that books, movies, music or magazines should be removed from the library? No I don't I think that should be removed only because if you remove them your probably going to lose more costumer's.     I'm going to be honest here, most people like to read. I know I sometimes read to study and if they got rid of the books that I read to study. How would I study? Even teachers go to the library to study or to even get books, or maybe get books for there grand kids or there kids. Parents do the samething.      People don't understand that music helps everybody some point in time. I know people who listen to music to help them consentriate on different things like homework, regular work, or even being stressed out. There are alot of different ways that music helps alot of people. If people decided to feel offensive over stuff like that then something is wrong with them because after all these years there have been no complaints.     Honestly i have never got movies or magazine's from the lilbrary before. People do it for there kids or grand kids, I don't really see the big deal. Its not like they are watching anything bad. They mostly have kid movies not bad ones.     Why would people want to take little thing like that from little kids? In a way that makes me mad because I like little kids they don't hurt anybody."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4338	2	"The Author Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does anyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I do believe certain materials, such as music, books, and movies shouldn't be on a  childrens shelf  to read, but rather on an adult shelf .     I believe every author has his or her right to express ones self and to be accepted for that. We all have our own beliefs and standards that we would like others to respect even if we dont agree on there beliefs. If  every book that was found offensive was taken of  a shelf we would soon have no books left. The reason for that is because everyone finds certain thing offensive.     Many children are intersted in certain thing and we cant hold them back from that unless it is inappropriate or goes againts family morals or valus such a religous beliefs. It would be a good thing to monater what your children are reading, wacthing and listening to.     On the other hand adult shelfs will have many diffrent things that would be offensive to many diffrent people unlike childrens books. Writing is a way to show a persons expressions and what they stand for although it @MONTH1 not be pleasing to me or any other person.      But what if we write a book and sombody does not like it then we wouldnt like it if they took it off the shelf. that would show direpect to a person who has thought long and hard on there work. Learn to stand proud on what you believe. Learn also to respect others as well and to let children be around safe family type of books, music and magazines"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4340	2	"Censorship for the future kids of america.    Personally i have read some disturbing books also watched some grotesque and twisted, disturbing rated @CAPS1 movies. Not even talking about all the messed up music ive heard so far in my lifetime.    What it comes down to is alot of the music today is about sex, drugs, money, and violent crimes and gangs. The movies have a rating system which helps out for little kids. Books any one can get from a public library and some are about murder, rape, gang, violence, and all the horrable reality of the devilsh deeds in the world.    I personally dont have a kid but if i had a kid and he read a book that was bad or heard a dirty song with some of those lyrics and if he watched a rated @CAPS1 movie i would wanna file a complaint because thats not how i want my kid growing up. With a twisted mind and a vocabulary of a little punk with curse words every ten seconds coming out his mouth. Also i would'nt want my kid kissing his mom with that kind of stuff coming out his mouth.    But the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to keep all that stuff away from kids until there old enough to go get it on there own like they need to be @NUM1 to go see a rated @CAPS1 movie. That is how it should have always been."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4344	2	"In many @CAPS1 libraries across the nation, a numerous amount of: books, magazines, movies and music aren't provided because they are found offensive. I do not believe this should happen because everybody is unique and @MONTH1 find different types of work offensive. Who is it that chooses these items to be taken out of libraries and why should they be the only ones to say what goes and what stays?      Everybody is different in their own way and everyone has their own interests and opinions. Some people are athletic, gothic, preppy and nerdy. The library is open to anybody that wishes to enter. What happens if the people that choose what content is provided in the library, doesn't like scary books, so they take all of the scary books out? What if their is a person that only reads scary books? What then will they have to read? I bet if that person had the ability to choose what stays and what goes in the library, they would only have horror in the library. I do not believe that anybody should have the right to censor what content is provided in @CAPS1 libraries. Everyone has their own opinion and interests so they should have everything open in libraries.     There is a reason that @CAPS1 libraries are called @CAPS1. That means that it is open to anyone and everyone. There should be all kinds of different genres to read and all sorts of movies to choose from. Just because one person doesn't like a certain kind of genre, or doesn't find it appropriate for a certain viewing audience, does not mean that they can take it out of a @CAPS1 library. That would be why there is such thing as sections in libraries. If you don't find a certain type of book appropriate, place it in the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' section of your library. For example: @PERSON1, he is a very popular author to many different viewing audiences. His ideas are very different than most. He writes horror but displays gore and a lot of sexual content in his writing. It is his own writing style. If the people that choose what is in the libraries, don't find that appropriate or if they find it offensive, they should put it in the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' sections or even the '@CAPS3' section. It should be up to the childrens' parents what their kid is reading; not the library itself.     I do not believe that anyone should choose what is and isn't provided in libraries. Everybody is unique, different and have their own opinions on different things and ideas. If you remove a specific type of book, movie, magazine or music from a library, and it's the only kind a certain person reads, what then will they have to read? What if somebody took out the kind that only you like to read? What then will you do? If everybody had the choice and right to do this, I don't think that anything will be left in libraries. All genres of everything should be available to the @CAPS1. If you don't find a book appropriate, place it in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 section of your library to still have it open to anybody. That would just be a big @CAPS9 to anybody who decides to pick it up and read it. You need to think of everybody, not just yourself."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4350	2	"Taking 'offensive' books from the shelves of libraries is like taking away the right of speech.  There is not a point to it. People in this country have the right of speech. Along with that comes the right to have your voice be heard.  An author's opinions @MONTH1 be offensive to some but does that mean he or she should not have a voice?  Writers get their ideas from somewhere society plays a huge role in what ideas these authors conjer up, taking these books away will not change the way people think and feel, and most importantly citizens of the @LOCATION1 have the right to make their own choices; that being if you don't like a book don't check it out.     Writers @MONTH1 state things that to some degree @MONTH1 offend one in a million people.  Others see it as freedom of speech and writing.  An author who writes a story that involves sex is not trying to extend their writing and thoughts to second graders.  But if a person has a problem with the way the author sees the world walking out their front door will show that same thing.  Some books @MONTH1 be fictional but that does not mean they don't get ideas from somewhere else.  Society plays a big part in the ideas and thoughts of most writers.  So when they write a book that has 'inappropriate' actions in it they got it from the way people truly are in the world.       Banning a book from the library that has a sex scene or provacitive language does not --by any means-- make the world stop having sex and saying curse words. Kids are learning this through hearing their parents swear or their peers in class talking about sex.  Reading a book about it will not change the fact that they are still learning about it in many other ways.  If the books that swear were no longer on library shelves society still will not change.  There is no perfect society.     Setting a book on a shelf with offensive language does not cause harm to anyone.  If an idividual doesn't like the way an author expresses themselves through their writing that person should not check that author's books out from the library.  No single person is forced to read a book they are offended by.  Getting rid of a book because of an unhappy parent does nothing but waste paper and intelligence. The library is not liable for the feelings of the readers.  If the reader does not like the book they are able to close it.  No one has glued their fingers to it.       Many people in today's world would agree that banning books from our public libraries will not have as much of an effect as some would like it to.  Banning books is an unknowledgeable thing to do to keep your kids from learning bad things.  Society shows that the writers are getting their ideas from somewhere, taking these books away will not take away the way people think and behave, and if some one does not like a book they should not read it"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4358	2	"We all have our favorite books and some we like others @MONTH1 not. Have you ever walked into the library in hope of finding your all time favorite book that you nearly forgot about, or maby a book a friend recomended to you? What happens when you get there and the book has been censored? Most books we see in our public or school libraries are are bookes that are well liked or are favorites of many. Books open a new world to everyone and should not be taken away.     To begin, I will explain some problems in our libraries. Some people believe the books and magazines in our libraries should be censored and removed from the shelves because it could be offensive to some people because of racial shurs or comments. This is a big problem because most books written years ago took place long ago like @PERSON1 for example, @MONTH1 be considered offensive but, this book gives a glimpse of what was going on in this time period and without it some people would never know what happened and we couldn't learn from those mistakes and make better choices in the future.     Some books that are censored have great educational value. Everyone has there prefrence on books and what some say should be taken away because of what they think others @MONTH1 not. If all books that are bad or offencive were taken off the shelves then eventually we would have no books left. We have the right to read any book out there no matter how horrendus it @MONTH1 be, besides you can go to church and read worse things that are being censored out of our libraries. If we couldn't read some books like many classics it would take educational value away from us all. Think about all the books we have read and learned from that have the possibility of being censored. Before someone gets into a book they should read the informational part on the back to see what it is about before they start to read something not suited for them.     I believe that no book should be censored and should have the freedom to sit on a shelf and be read by anyone who wants to read it. Being censored is not protecting anyone it only makes things worse. If someone feels offended then they shouldn't read it, it's their choice to pick it up or not. Hopefully I have persuaded you that no book should be censored and everyone has the right to read what they want"	4	4		4	3	3	3

4371	2	"Many people have different views on different types of things. There is not much that can be helped with that. No one can never make everybody happy. That is a major part of life. I do not think they should remove materials from libraries just because some people find them offensive. You cannot make everyone happy, some people enjoy those materials, and everyone is entitiled to their own opinion.     The first reason they should not remove offensive materials from the library is because you will not make everybody happy by doing that. Just because some people take offense to certain things, does not mean that everyone does. If they do not like it, they do not have to read it or listen to it. They have libraries so you can pick out books (and other materials) that you like. You have a choice there. There are lots of books that are at libraries around the world. People are going to be mad whether they are there or not. Have you ever heard the saying '@CAPS1't judge a book by its cover?' @CAPS2, well that could also be a reason people want materials removed. They might see a 'suggestive' cover or something, and they might take total offense to that. Just because a cover of a book might make people take offense to it doesn't mean they should remove it.      The second reason offensive materials should not be removed is because it is enjoyable for some people. There is a reason it is in the library, and that reason is because some people enjoy it. If there was a book or magazine that never got checked out, do you think they would keep it? Nope. I am pretty sure if it never got checked out, they would get rid of it. Obviously someone has to read, listen, or watch it. People get offended by things everyday. Removing 'offensive' materials from libraries will not be much help to the problem. It @MONTH1 help a little, but there are still going to be people who get offended so easily.      The third reason they should keep materials is because everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Just because some people think that there are offensive materials in the library does not mean other people do. For some people, taking away things like that would be like making kids at school wear uniforms. It takes away freedom. We are living in @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is supposed to be a free country. It is really not a free country when you have people taking away books and movies because they are offensive to people. I got news for you. If you @CAPS1't like it, @CAPS1't read it. There is no harm at all by keeping materials on shelves.      No matter what, someone is always going to take offense to something. The world is not perfect, and it is never going to be perfect. Taking materials off the shelves because it is offensive to some people isn't going to make the world a better place. People are going to be mad or angry no matter what happens"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4382	2	"I am not in agreement because young children should not be exposed to certain offensive books.  However, I believe that books should not be removed or censored in the libraries. because they will separate be washig some bad things and they will be a bad idea"	2	2		2	1	1	1																		
4383	2	I think that the cencorship in libraries should defenetly be relevant.  Such as i think that if someone wants to check out an adult book they should be required to show id at desk.  Many children take advantage of this they rent books and games they know parents would never allow.  A cencory system should be a quit simple arrangment fot the public library systems. Private libraries can do as they choose they are not under any state law.  On the other hand public libraries are under state and city law they should not be able to show adult things to children.  For example in many libraries around the @CAPS1.S there all books called manga or anime books alot of them show partial nudity and other graphic things not suitable for younger children but are only rated @NUM1+.  I think there could be many changes in the library systems it is your choice if  you want to change them or not	3	2		3	3	2	3																		
4389	2	"I think that no source of knowledge should taken off any shelf in any librairy because a few people think it's offensive. In my own personal opinion someone could find a book offensive and another person could think it is reasonable. People can't make the judgment to say this is offensive to me so therefore it's offensive to everyone who reads it. Some of the best books on our shevles are the ones that @MONTH1 be offensive.     Some books are racist; Of @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 for example has some racist and sexist comments and remarks. If everyone got mad about that then a very good book wouldn't be read by the people who are going to run the country when i'm older. I know that all the older books would be gone to and then no one would know about what happened in the @NUM1's. Also some of the @ORGANIZATION1 shows people watch are ten times worse then the books people read,if you find a book offensive don't read it!     When i hear about a book being offensive it makes me want to read it. It gives the book charactor and makes it humorouse. We can't just have the same old books talking about the same old things because that gets boring after a while. Sometimes from thoughs books you even learn something about your self that makes you wonder if i didn't read this book would i still have found this out. Sometimes it brings out the best in people and thats the best part about reading a book like that.     Libraries are a place to go and look at all the books you could ever think of reading and no one should be able to take that away from people. I want my kids to be able to have the same options that i had growing up plus all the new books coming out. If you ask me it's just not right to take away someone elses choice of knowledge. Thats my personal opinion on taking books off the shelves of public libraries."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4392	2	"Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? No. I strongly disagree. D     @CAPS1 you know that there is more than @CAPS5 radio station? Well, @CAPS3 you do. Not just @CAPS5 person should be able to talk for everyone. I enjoy every genre of music and books.  @CAPS4's pretty much my life. All I know is that when I get offended by a song, I change @CAPS4. When I'm reading a book I don't like, I put @CAPS4 down. @CAPS4's not your job to make my decisions. I live my own life and personally think you should live yours as well.     Books, movies, plays, games, magazines, all things of that sort are for our entertainment. If they began taking them off shelves because of vulgar things and things that offend people, then why do we have freedom of speech? Those people that are offended need to put whatever @CAPS4 is down and move on.  Just because a handful of people are offended by the everyday things that people use to stay amused, doesn't mean they need to be taken away.      Authors and directors spend months, even years making movies and writing books just to entertain us and feel accomplished. If they started taking them off our shelves and off the big screens, people would lose jobs. For example look at the @PERSON2 @ORGANIZATION1. That can easily offend a person, but those are brilliant pieces of work.      I am personally the kind of person that reads books that are suspenseful, books that keep me on the edge of my seat. People enjoy books that they can relate to, and some people can relate to those books that are 'offensive.' I, myself, have read a book that cinsisted of drugs and viloence that I related to and @CAPS4 helped me out, @CAPS4 made me realize its not always the right thing to do.      I think people need to realize that all those books, movies, magazines, and all the aboe that 'offend' them, are reality. No matter where you go, what you do, what you throw out, or what you keep in the house, your kids, parenst, friends, everyone will see @CAPS4 sometime in theirlives.      Viloence and drugs are seen everyday. Many more things that offend people are always going to be there. If all of those things are offensive to some people, then they need a reality check.  Books like that can influence kids to wanna go the rightdirection. They read a book or see a movie with a drug addict in prison and theyll think, '@CAPS2, I'm never going there.' @CAPS3, I can't say that goes for all kids in this world, but you get the jist of what I'm trying to say.     If @CAPS4's the parents that are worried about their kids getting into that kind of stuff, be my guest to remove @CAPS4 from your household, but not from everyone, not from the people who enjoy @CAPS4. I'm a strong believer that people know right from wrong, so why not just grow up a little bit and do what's right? Those books, movies, and magazines that are offensive, are enjoyable to me.      This makes me think of drama. People say they hate @CAPS4, but no matter what, @CAPS4's everywhere, and @CAPS4 will always be everywhere. If you can't get through life being offended every @CAPS3 and then, then how do you think you'll survuve. What do you think is in store for the next years to come?  You must learn to deal with @CAPS4.     Taking away all of these things, I think, is a mistake. If people are against @CAPS4, they need to worry about themselves and just leave @CAPS4 alone. They can make their own decisions, they don't have to pick up and @PERSON1 book when there is a @ORGANIZATION1 in their reach. That is what literature is about, writing. Do you honeslty think the author was worried about offending anyone? No, because the author or director whom wrote the book or made the movie, they knew what is was about and they know that not all of the world will see @CAPS4. Not all of the world will care to see @CAPS4. They know that people are smart enough to read the summary before they get'offended.'      @CAPS4 irritates me when people think they need to live for everyone. @CAPS4's like the saying, '@CAPS5 man's trash is another man's treasure.' You might not like @CAPS4, you might even hate @CAPS4. But once @CAPS4's out of your hands, the next person might come back and drastically fall in love with @CAPS4.     I think that just because someone picks up a book and @CAPS4 offends them, @CAPS4 doesn't mean they needed to whiped off the shelves. Grow up, put whatever @CAPS4 is that offends you down, and walk away."	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
4395	2	I think that your parents should have to sign a peice of paper saying that it is ok or its not ok for the person to go to that side of the library. It is up to the parents and the way there kids will handle it.     On one side of the library it would be more geared to a more mature audience no pornagraphic material of course but stuff that wouldnt be considered @NUM1. Kids fifteen and and older would understand. They might also have to have an adult with them.      On the other side of the library it would be more of a childrens area with child storys. It would be targeted for more kids that are fourteen years and younger would like.      There would have to be some one in the dividing line being shown the pass that says its ok or not. It would be a little difficult but it would satisfy both parties.     It is up to the parent to decide if it is ok for there children to read a certain content of language and description. The child must be at least @NUM2 in order to get a pass from the parent though.     I deffinately agree with Katherine Paterson eventually your kids will find out what all those things are. I would rather have my kids learn from a book and ask me then find it out on the streets where they could end up getting hurt or in trouble with the law. Or even going to a party and end up doing something that might kill them.	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4403	2	"What would you do if a woman walked into a library and started throwing a tantraum about how inappropriate a book was, and she wanted it removed from the shelves? Would you just stare and wonder if she was crazy? Would you think that this is a public place, and everyone has their own opinions? I believe that even if someone thinks a material in a library is inappropriate, the material should not be taken off shelves.     Many people actually believe materials in a library are too offensive or inappropriate. Unsurprisingly, libraries can't exactly do much about that except remove them from the shelves if absolutely nessessary. However, when you think about it, if everyone complained about a certain book being offensive, there would eventually be no more books! For example, I would not want my little brother reading @PERSON1 books because some chapters @MONTH1 contain a sex scene. However, my brother will eventually be older, and he'll be able to understand. If I would have gotten rid of that book, I wouldn't be letting other people enjoy it.     If you were to get books removed that were about @CAPS1 because you were @CAPS2, many @CAPS3 wouldn't be happy to say the least. This could be about any subject matter, however. The more books that are removed from the library, the less people will know about the subject. Eventually, as I've said before, there will be no more books left! Everyone has their own opinion of what is appropriate or not, and everyone's views are different.     The solution to this problem is simply to not remove the books. Sure, you might get complaints. But odds are, more people are unoffended rather than offended. Americans do have the right to fight for this, but with the majority being unoffended, it's a tough case to win.     I believe all books would be fine left on shelves. If you take off one book, you might as well take off the rest. Next time you are picking out a book, and you find it offensive, think about how other people might want to read it. They might even need the information for a paper they're writing for a class. You never know who might need the information. Don't be selfish; keep the books on the library shelf."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4409	2	"Censorship in libraries? A yes or a No? I believe that there should not be censorship in libraries. There are not many things 'offensive' or 'harmful' in most libraries in @LOCATION1. I dont see who would come up with such an abserd idea.      To me there are just way to many ways for people to get offended. @MONTH1 I remind you that we almost changed our plege to the flag of our country by getting rid of the word 'god' all because some people dont believe in god. Now we are suppose to get rid of good books just because they are child friendly?! Think about all the amazing books, movies and magazines that would have to be removed from our libraries just because one person says, 'I find this book offensive' or says, 'I dont think this book is apporaite for my child.' @CAPS1 about the people that do like that book and now wont be able to read it anymore all beacuse of that one person?     There are sections in libraries for a reason! Just put the naughty books in the eight-teen year or older section so younger kids dont see them. The people who want to get rid of so called dangerous books to childern make libraries sound like there porngrapic shops. Most libraries are not filled with horrible bad books that will cause there child to be mentaly scared forever. Hell there are really that mant books out there anyways.     Now sometimes a bad book @MONTH1 end up in the kids section but that dose not mean we have to remove that book forever form all the other people who want to read that book. All librarie workers just have to make sure to put all books in there rightfull spots and nothing bad will happen. The bad books will be in the adult section and the child frendily books will be in another. Have some libabrie workers watching the area and make aure little kids dont go in the libabrie. This will prevent childern from seeing the bad books because they will be in the adult section.      In conclusion I answer this question by saying no. There are just way to many good books that would have to be gone forever"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4411	2	"The content in todays materials are not always subtible for young children. Information now distributed in the media and other networks can be harmful for some young children to read or be surrounded by, including video games. By growing up in a violent enviornment, children observe and have the greater chance at becoming violent. The continuence of censorship in todays materials are a necessity to the well being of the children in todays society.     In video games there are ratings that help explain wat is subtible for each age throughout childhood and adolesence. Movies are also the same, making it harder for younger children to see certain movies. Books and magazines are not as well protected although they should be. Age and maturity plays a huge role in whether or not a child should be aloud to read and be introduced to specific material. Violence is a major trend in video games in todays world, and some of the influence it brings on children is unecessary and eventually detrimental to their well being.     The reason ratings should be changed is because children obsorb their enviornment and become what they see, so if they are introduced to violent behavior they have a greater chance in becoming violent children. In libraries there are sections for every age group, specific genre of books, fiction, and non fiction. But some of the explicit material in books and magazines should also be censored before they are distributed on shelves and allowed available for young teenagers and children. As a part of the community libraries should take apart in the well being of the children and not expose them to information earlier than necessary.     Throughout my own experience, I have seen children grow up too fast when exposed to certain knowledge. Especially in todays music, radios do a good job in editing content in songs, by puting parental advisory on certain cd's, but this still does not stop them from buying the material. In games including, @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, @NUM1, etc. teens are now becoming accostumed to this type of behavior, that is not safe nor condusive for children.     By censoring certain material it disallows the continuence of bad behavior amongst our youth today"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4412	2	"READ WITH @CAPS1     I do not believe that libraries carry the responsibilty to censor reading materials. When a person enters a library, they immediately must infer that, because libraries are place in which knowledge is accumulated, that some of that information they find @MONTH1 not cooincide with what they believe. If a person believes a book is offensive, they can just as easily put it down as they had picked it up.     Obviously, however, there are certain exceptions. Childrens' sections, of course, should be limited to those intended for younger readers. Putting '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' into a childrens' section hardly seems logical. just as much as putting '@CAPS4 @CAPS5' into the adults section.     In addition, author @PERSON1 once stated that if she was able to ban a book from a library, the same right would have to be given to all other patrons as well. Thus leading to all the books in a library being unable to be read. the knowledge contained within them unknown.     There are, as with any ordinance, exceptions. For example, if a library is intended solely for the use of younger audiences, censorship should hardly be considered a crime. The exclusion of inappropriate items, such as permisquous reading material, keeps childeren from formulating ideas about concepts they @MONTH1 not be able to fully understand.     With all these things considered, banning books from a library hardly seems to be the best course of action. A library should be a place of enlightenment. Opposing ideas should be presented. Leaving the readers to formulate their own decisions about what they believe. Because books are like atoms. When two opposing types collide, a burst of energy is released."	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
4420	2	"It is a prominent question of debate whether or not certain materials in libraries such as books, music, movies and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Although there are materials that @MONTH1 me harmful to children, freedom of information is far more importiant than protection because censorship is unconstitutional, prevents readers from an impartial perspective, and in some cases hides pressing societal issues that are deemed improper by the censors.     The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 states that freedom of speech, religion and the press shall not be denied or abridged. In more general terms, the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 grants freedom of expression. Censorship is effectively unconstitutional. It prevents freedom of expression. Students and scholars alike cannot access all information that should be avaliable to them if not for censorship. Although private business and libraries can be permitted to censor because they have their own contracts that permit this, public libraries and schools are effectively breaching the constitution when they censor.     Censorship prevents a whole and complete perspective on an issue. Censors often ban particular books because of personal views of alleged 'immorality.' @CAPS5 a clear and complete access to all information, how can one make any valid conclusion about anything? If, for example, one wants to learn the difference between an agnostic philosophy and a deist one, but has no access to any agnostic books, which were banned by intolerant religious zealots, you cannot effectively learn anything. Every special interest group wants to ban a certain type of material. Author Katherine Paterson said that 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS6 this is true. If every special interest group deems it proper to censor material that is against their interests, there will be no material left. There will be no knoledge left. Withought knowledge, we as a human race are left in the dark.     Many books are banned that address great problems of society. @PERSON3's @CAPS7 @NUM1 addressed the growing problems of censorship and the dangers of technology. As the fireman @CAPS8 @PERSON4 burnt books, so ironically the novel was censored. Perhaps this is a ploy by the censors to defend theire special interest, that is censorship. They feel powerfull when they restrict other people's freedoms. A novel by @PERSON2, @CAPS9 @CAPS10, was banned. Apart from vulgar language in the book, @CAPS9 @CAPS10 also denounced free will and portrayed the US's brutal bombing of @LOCATION1 in @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS15. This book reveals much about human truth, yet it was banned. How will society ever change if any time a revolutionary book is written it is banned?     Censorship is a great problem. Although there are many works that are meaninglessly violent, brutal and cruel, no book or any other material should be censored. In public libraries and schools, censorship is blatently unconstitutional. Censorship prevents people from seeing the whole perspective, and censorship hinders societal change. Censorship must be denounced as a restriction on our inteligence and liberty."	5	5		5	4	4	4

It is a personal choice and you dont have to be exposed to it if you dont want to. Those who are against censorship try some ways of keeping your children away from the bad or yourself, but dont try to remove it completly.      One reason for censorship is because it provides hordes of information and expands your mind in different ways. The material or bad material you get out of it is your choice to read. but i think some of it is good for kids not so that they can be corrupted. It is so the kids can expand there imagination as well. However i do think children should wait until they are of certain age to read or watch this material until they are mature enough to seperate reality from fiction. Also it teaches good @CAPS1 that you might not have learned anywhere else. Numerous of these articles are about real life and what is going on today. I think it is great for kids and adults to know what is going on in the world. If you leave kids in darkness then you leave them with no right of an oponion. Any parent can tell there child that something is bad for them, but you can never really know unless you experience it for themselves. The can make up there own minds, and usually they do what is best.     Another reason for censorship is that it can be an escape for some people. There are people who enjoy reading about fiction or tacky things in life. It keeps them going on a regular day basis. You never know what somebody enjoys doing. If somebody is having a bad day and they want to read or watch what they like and find out they are unable now there is a good chance poeple will be furious. If i was unable to do what I like to do i would probably be angry or depressed. It is not alway a ferocious topic. If you want to keep your children sheltered from it then fine, but the people who can handle it dont want it to be out of public access. Also keep it in libraries because if you dont want it dont give your kids library passes. However if  you do,  supervise them while they are there. It costs money to go out and buy books when you can just borrow them from the library. People who dont have money or dont want to own the books shouldnt have to go pay for them when it can be kept from whoever it needs to be kept from.     The last reason for Censorship is it keeps people interested. It also teaches oodles of information. Not only does it entertain, but also there is so much vocab you pick up on from these books. I have personally learned most of my @CAPS1 from books, and i hardly had to pay for any of them. When you dont have the money to guy buy all the books you want the library has the same information for you, but its just more availiable rather than going to the store. Whoever finds it offensive thats fine. There is nobody forcing you to take these items off of the shelves, and its not there business what other people see either. If people really want to read these items they are going to one way or another banning them from one place is not going to remove censorship from our world. Children are already exposed to this in school and on telivision. They need to learn more than just appropriate material if they want to understand the real world.Censorship is viewed as good, bad, and neutral. Nobody is forcing you to view it, but on the other hand nobody can force you to stay away from it. Let people make there own decisions. If you keep complaining there will be numerous amounts of complaints right back at you. Censhorship should be taken as 'sticks and stones will break my bones , but words will never hurt me'. With that being said dont avoid the inevitable."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4456	2	"Should materials such as books, music, movies, magazines and etc., be removed from sheleves if they are found offensive? Should them magazines and etc., but put up in a place for that age group? Should them type of things but in the @CAPS1 with children? Should they be in @CAPS1's period?                                                                     I thing that the @CAPS1 should have all type of books in there because that's what a @CAPS1 is for. But I do think that if people are finding it offensive to have them type of books open to children they should ask the @CAPS1 to change how they have the books. But I also think the @CAPS1 should put them book up in a part were they have adult things and book at. Because them type of book isn't made for children eyes.                  The @CAPS1 should put people ages on the @CAPS1 cards so that this want be a problem to the poeple or the @CAPS1. Because then you would no how old they are . And only @NUM1 years of age can she the books and magnizines, etc., that isn't right for young children eyes. But I Do think that it is offensive to people that have young children and there children are reading it . And it is offensive to the people that just dont like what the book, music and magazines stand for.           One thing I don't agree on is that books should be taking off the shelves because there are so people that comes to the @CAPS1 just to read them books. And the people who read them books are going to be upset that you took the books off the shelves. Because me personal I like the magnizes, books , music and the movies and I don't find nothing offensive about them. And I like the movies to because it gives me somthing to do and watch when I am at home.          I also think that the movies and music is something we all love that's in the @CAPS1. Because it give me and my friends something to do after school. So if you take away the thing we like what will we have to do after school when we go to the @CAPS1. And the thing's that was named make the @CAPS1 so fun an peaceful.  The @CAPS1 is a place were you can come and whine your day down. With out them thing there trying to take of the shelves it's going to be boring. People who don't have nothing to do doing the day come to the @CAPS1 and look for that offensive stuff."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4463	2	"Censorship is just another way to take knowledge from another person or a society. Wanting to take and hide even the smallest of discreet history, politic corruption, and inappropriate sights to a generation can turn them all ignorant and unaware of their past, present, and possibly future.                 Censorship is extremely dangerous to a soceity because it leaves them vulnerable to the future. For example, if people tried to censor @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and many other environmentalist around the globe of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 possibility, then the world would not be able to have the chance to stop or at least slow the upcoming disaster by going green. Instead, we would most likely die a few hundred years before that deadline. Also, maybe if more people knew about @PERSON2's censorship of his oil distribution among the @LOCATION2 (during his presidency) people might have at least discussed of impeachment.                                                                            Try to think how the future would have been if racism, terrorism, wars, or even an event like the holocaust were censored. That could be taken as brainwashing! Even though that @MONTH1 cause peace and happiness around the world, we still would know nothing of our history leaving us historically, unintellilectual. Then think of all the sudden problem it would cause if that information was suddenly found. In the book series of 'The @CAPS5' by @PERSON1, a city has been isolated from their past, who they call 'the @CAPS6', and they are basically brainwashed to think that they almost destroyed the world by war and destruction by the new government and their new technology.     Luckily, in our own era I do not believe we are censored from most things except of course politics going on between other countries. For example, the @LOCATION1 bin @CAPS7 killing was nothing of anyones awareness except the @CAPS8 of @ORGANIZATION1, military, and @CAPS9. That was a thoughtful choice from @CAPS10 as well instead of announcing it on @NUM1 news. I'd rather of coursebe notified about my history, because it's interesting and it shows why things are now. Books like 'To @CAPS11 a @CAPS12' or '@PERSON3' should never be taken off shelves for young pupils or old matures. Although it would seem a bit more offensive to hearing a historical racist cocasian singing about negroes than a racist book, I would always be interested in hearing about it.     Censorship should definitely be illegal itself in libraries, @CAPS13 stores, and any other selling stores of books, music, movies, and/or magazines. Although, I have not heard of any recent censorships, but then again should I not be able to? It is censorship.."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4464	2	"Dear, Katherine Paterson      I was was thinking about if they items you listed to be taken offenisve, well I believe that its a free country and that all people should be treated equal,what im trying to get to is that the newpaper organization should keep doing what they do! in fact should add more. Yes their should be restictions on some things but to solve the under age buying just make people use their @CAPS1!         By doing this I think this would solve alot of issues, taken it all away would be alittle to serious for just some magazines or moives.So keep doing what your doing just set a higher restiction on sells and things should be just fine !                              from your dearly,                                             zack"	2	2		2	2	3	2																		
4468	2	"Everyone has an opinion. Don't you agree? That's what makes us different, this is why some of us would rather watch @CAPS1 compared to @CAPS2, or why some want to listen to pop instead of country. A library is a place that brings all sorts of people together. It's a place of interest and information, a place for research and enjoyment. So here is my question: 'Do we really want to remove certain materials from library shelves just because some people find them offensive.'?I don't believe so, as the quote says by the author, Katherine Paterson, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I agree with that statement! Think about this, if we allowed people to get rid of the library books they just don't like, if everyone had that right. We would have no more books, no materials left to study or pleasure read.I have to admit I've seen things that I don't necessarily agree with, but other people might. You can't just have a library all to yourself. Something for just your interests and nobody elses. That's not what a library is for, millions of people use libraries for different purposes. So no I really don't think we should remove items from the shelves. Only pick up what you find interresting and leave it at that. We all have rights just like we all have likes, dislikes, and minds of our own.Opinions define us, choices shape us, but libraries do so much more, they advance our knowledge, make our dreams a reality, and sometimes even broaden our horizons. We need books, music, movies, and even magazines, but we need them all together. That's my position on this topic, I hope this helped form yours."	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
4470	2	"Yes I do believe that any book found offensive to any person should be removed from the book shelf. You have to think about it from the other person's perspective, or put yourself in their shoes. Say you went to the library and that certain thing was constantly there or it felt like it was constantly hanging over your head, that would be a tough problem to deal with in your every day visit to the library. Also  in your everyday life.      One reason for this is because if you find a book on a shelf and it offends you and another person knows it affends you then most likely they will use it against you to say mean and harsh things. Another reason i believe an offensive book should be removed from the shelf is because what if you are in that place very often. I mean if you have to see that book every day dont you think that would start to get on your nerves a little bit. So what I am trying to say is I do beleive if there is an offensive book on a shelf remove it.     Music should not be as much of an issue as books. Music is something you listen to or you hear. Books are things you read.     I say music should not be as big of an issue because music you do not see like you do books. Books is usally says it right there in black and white. Also the posibality of it being right there in front of you in words and a picture. So what I am saying here is that if you find something offensive then fix it instead of letting it bother you every day of you life. So get it fixed now or just get over what ever you find offensive"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4473	2	"Removing books off of shelves in our public library? To me, that sounds crazy. I can see how some people might be offended by some books, music, movies, magazines, etc., but some people appreciate it. It's diversity, some people love the down-to-earth literature, but some people can't handle it. Why take away something that only a few people disagree with?        I believe some of the best entertainment in libraries are the most offensive, but it is all fact. I mean, if this is such a problem there should be a certain section to find those things in. If people want to complain then they can get out of that section, because people like me will be in that section ready to learn about all these different varieties of entertainment. Whether if it's offensive or not.People @MONTH1 find some of it offensive, but I believe it makes that person stronger. It helps them realize how lucky they are that they're not being treated a certain way in the offensive book they're reading. It's just a piece of entertainment! If it offends you and you're not entertained, go find something that does!           Even though I hear of people reading offensive books I've never really seen one myself. I think some people just get offended too easily. That's where we should reason with them instead of giving into their demands. So what if they aren't taken off the shelves? Like I said, we can make a certain section for them type of things. If they aren't happy with the outcome, they will get over it.           Now that you read what  I had to say, what do yu think? Do you think we should remove certain entertainment off of library book shelves? Or should we just reason with the people who are offended? I hope what you read today helps keep books on the shelves and readers happy!"	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
4475	2	I dont think people should remove the books and movies and music cause its the peoples choice to read and listen and watch the things that that get.      Why should people change cause other people can't handle what the stuff has on it. If the people want to read or watch or listen to bad stuff they can its not other peoples choice.     The people will choose what they want or what they think they want to read or watch or listen too. People will find out by themselves what they want to hear or listen too.     Like I said its the people who choose what they want to watch or listen or read and it is nobodies elses choice to say so. The people will find out what they want there kids to read and listen and watch and so will they.     This is what i think of this essay it will be up to the people to choose what they want the listen and hear too.	2	3		2	3	3	3																		
4478	2	"Books should be removed only if they are found a certain degree of offensive. Some other books, though, are meant for educational use and not meant to offend anyone. People sometimes take it too seriously. Many books have posed a great educational source for many years.     Books have been around for a very long time. People many years ago used to read books on scrolls, or even in pictures to tell stories. Stories have been around for a very long time and are meant to be stories, not criticised pieces of work to put down other people. There are a lot of books, however, that have been meant to put other people down. These books I agree should be taken off the shelves since they might promote people to turn on certain races.     A good book that demonstrates it is not putting others down but sounds like it might is 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2'. This book has been intended for people to read it and learn of the life back when there was slavery or, a time just after slavery but where people did not respect the newly freed men. Another book that tells of times during slavery is 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1'. This book tells of a young boy that runs away to live his old life and meets up with a runaway slave named @PERSON1.This book has been meant to tell of what slaves would be punished by if they were caught.     Many other books exist as these. But I guarentee that over ninety percentile of books are meant to be used for educational purposes due to the context they have been used in. Most people will take books the wrong way, but that is only because they are afraid that they will be judged, just as the book was judged by its cover. I have read many books over the past couple years, and I find that many of the books that I read have proved to be educational to me.     There are some books though, that I agree should be taken off the shelves due to them being over the top on offensive. Censorship has a job to protect us from many unnerving topics and I agree that certain books should be taken off the shelves. But, I think that sometimes, places go over the top with censorship and should let certain people decide which books are right for a place, as well as movies. The world is maturing, even as everyone speaks, and people are learning all the time. There should be some censorship in public places, but only on over-the-top topics where authors have written about an issue that will offend many people"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4480	2	"When you have children would you want to shield them from something you think is wrong, even though it goes on in the world around you every single day? Today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that, censorship.    One thing about censorship is that it is just a way the government can control what everyday people say, hear, listen to, read, or even see in today's society. We shouldn't be controlled on what we can or can't read, watch, or listen to. I have experienced these things almost on a daily basis if it isn't on the radio it's on television. When someones words get beeped out for saying something vulgar or innapropriate.     The second thing about censorship is that no matter what it is, where it is, or even who it is someone will always have a problem with it. Just recently in one of my own classes we read an article about a very popular chldren's and young adult's film and a school tried to ban its books from its library because it dealt with sorcery. Most of every person I know that has read those books knows that sorcery isn't real. Why do people find it necessary to do things like that? I think most people just view something that could be entertaining to one person as completely disgusting and disturbing, just because it is a little bit different, I find that as unique not bad.      The third thing is no matter what public libraries shouldn't be censored. Everyone views things differently and they all have different tastes in music, literature, and films. Just because someone likes something someone else @MONTH1 find vulgar doesn't mean they should just be able to remove that from the library's public shelves. After all the library is public and I put a great deal of stress on it being public because every person in the world today are all different.     Today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that, censorship. Leaving off on a lighter foot, whether it is purple or green, or old or new, someone will always be able to find something wrong with it. I'm sorry to today's society for not being able to realize that most of its problem is trying to control everything that everyone does"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4492	2	"Every we go there is censorship. Childrean hear their parents saying them and are more than likely to repeat them. Children should know what cursing is and know it is not right to do. It should be up to the children what they read.       Books should be censored if they are made for children. Adults should have the option of reading any type of book they would like. Children who have been secluded should learn that curse words are a part of reality also. We can learn something from any thing we read.     There are a lot of facts teachers do not teach that books can. When uncensensored things are said aloud children are estatic. If they read themselves they would learn alot more. If your parents do not inform you either, you can miss out on some of the most important facts of life.      It is very unnecessary to have rated @CAPS1 movies.Parents should be able to watch a mature movie with their children without being on the watch for something they do not want their child to see. The choice of children watching censory movies should definitely be on the parent.     I always think it is a bad idea to have derrogatory pictures on magazines. These photos @MONTH1 give children negative thought, such as insecurity of wishing they looked better than the model. Children remember almost everthing they hear/see. It should be up to the children what they read."	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
4494	2	"Taking books off the shelves? I don't think so. When you go to the library, what kind of books do you look for? I like mysteries and scary books, they keep me on the edge of my seat, however; some that I have read @MONTH1 not be appropriate for children younger than me. People are saying they want to remove books, music, and movies from the library when they are found offensive, but I think that is a bad idea.      People don't always read books or watch movies because it is their choice. You can find a lot of younger kids at the library theses days for school purposes. From my own experience, I had to get a movie at the library once for a project. It was about the civil war. The movie had some disturbing scenes in it, but I had to watch it for school. If it had not been at the library, what would I have done? That is one reason why I do not think taking books and movies off the shelves would be a good idea.      As I said at the beginning, I like mystery books. Some mystery books have parts in them that @MONTH1 be offensive. The book I am reading now is about a murder of a young girl. I think this would be an offensive book for someone young, or for someone who's loved one was murdered, but that does not mean I think they should remove it from the library. If they took books like that away, what would the people that like them do? It does not seem fair to me.      For people who find books, movies, music, or magazines at the library offensive, simply do not use them. The library is a place where you can find almost anything you are interrested in. So lets keep everyone in mind, and their different interrests. It is also a place where you can find a lot of information even though it could be offensive. It would not be fair or right to remove books from the library"	4	3		4	4	4	4																		
4497	2	"There are many reasons why censorship can be thought of as a good thing, or a bad thing. I am against censorship. My reasons are that just because someting is there that you don't like, doesn't mean that you have to look at it or use it. There are plenty of people that would like to have access to that information or entertainment. Another reason is, that if there's something that someone doesn't  want their child looking at, then they should either trust that their child won't look at it, or prevent them from seeing it. Finally, what would be left if everyone were to remove somthing that they took offense to? Nothing would be left to read, listen to or watch.     First, why I think censorship is wrong, is that the people that take offense to what they want removed, don't have to look at whats offensive. No one is forcing them to look at it or use it. They're better off just ignoring it. Because other people, that don't take offense to it, have the right to look at or use it. The library might be the only place that someone could have access to that sort of material. So if someone were to remove that material, the person that needs or wants it, would not have the access to use it. And they are given the right to use it. Their child might even have the right to it.     Second is that some people wouldn't want their child seeing those things. But removing it shouldn't be that persons first instinct. I believe that the parent should be able to trust their own child not to look at it. And if they can't, then they need to somehow prevent their child from viewing it; not by removing it. The parent should be able to come up with a reasonable way of preventing their child from viewing things that they don't want the child viewing, rather than taking that thing away from the child, and the whole community.     Lastly, let's say that in a library, theres at least one book to each person in a community that offends that person. If they were each given the right to remove the book that offended them, what would be left to read? Absolutely nothing. And each of those people that removed a book, most likely would enjoy another book that someone thought was offensive. So now there isn't a single book for that person to read, just because everyone else disliked the books they didn't think were offensive. Once someone starts removing, other people will join in, and you'd be left with an empty library.      Thats what I think about cencorship. It's really just wrong. Personally, I would like to be able to go to my library and pick out a good book. And I know other people like to do that too. So why should anyone else be able to take that away from them"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4499	2	"I was asked the question 'Do you believe that a certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazine, etc.? should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensice?' I would have to say no. I dont think you should be in the library to be critisizing what other people believe in. But what if you just come past a book, movie, music, or magizine that is offensive? Just ignore it.      I dont think people have enough time to be caring what other people think, even though people do it all the time. Next time you see a book that is offensive to you just walk away from it and dont bother looking at it. Everything can be offensive to anyone, @PERSON2 was completly right when she had said '...If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...The you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think this day and age everykid knows more than they're supposed to anyways, so why cencor what they already know? What if you might like this specific series and it is about the haulacaust and it is like many different story made into one to tell about how the @CAPS1 stayed in the camps, but your not @CAPS2 or @CAPS3, and a @CAPS2 happens to read it and get it taken off the shelfs cause it's offensive. Maybe he thought it was a disgrace and lies about his home country and it's making people think they're all like the @CAPS5.If theat had happened to you what would you do? Would you go looking for a new book? Or would you be upset cause you weren't able to finish the whole series? Many people things offensive every single day, when they shouldn't.      People try to act like they're better than everyone else, and it's not right. If your one to take things in books, movies, music, or magazines offensive then you need to get over yourself and realize that you need to spend more time on living life rather than get upset cause of stupid pitty stuff. In music they're are certain words used that one might like to be called, but if a differnt race decided to sing about it too then he might get upset and think that he's being rasict. It's not being rasict, offenending, or directed towards you! So, just do everyone a favor and stop complaining. Now Katherine Paterson, @CAPS6 if you have a problem with your child or any other children taking a book off a shelf even though it might offend some I think you need to realize that it is a good thing that, that child is still trying to read, and trying to get better at reading by reading. There are selected magazines and movies out there on shelfs of publi libraries and stores that might be offending others, but if it is offending you why are you looking or even gonna buy/check it out?     I personally dont think any books should be taken off the shelf of any library anywhere. taking books off shelves are like telling people to stop reading"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4501	2	"When someone goes to the library, there is multiple items to choose from.  There are books, music, movies, magazines, etc.  But not all of this is nessessarilly a good thing.  There are several books, movies, and music albums that can be either offensive or not right for a library's audience.  The material that is offensive should not be on the shelves for children sake.     Although there is much good items in a library, there is also bad or offensive items in a library as well.  For example, an explicit music album.  If an explicit music album is just sitting on the shelf of a library, then any person could listen to it or take it out for awhile.  By taking out the bad music, that keeps younger kids away from the explicit music that most parents don't want there children listening to anyway.  Movies are also a problem in library's.  For example, library's having @CAPS1 rated movies on the shelves for anyone to take out to go watch.  Most @CAPS1 rated movies have something in them that doesn't make them child appropriate.  Movies that are @CAPS1 rated are rated that because of all the material in the movie.  This is why when these movies are played on television, they are edited so all audiences can watch.  So by taking these types of movies off the shelves in library's, it keeps young children away from inappropriate behavior.  Books are the same way as movies and music.  There are books on the shelves that some people concider 'funny', but in all reality, it's a harmful book.  There are books made that include racial material in them, even deragator statements.  By taking these types of books off the shelves of library's, a lot more people wouldn't be introduced to all the racial comments that occur.      For the sake of the children and young kids, any material that is found offensive in library's should be removed.  If library's would just remove all the bad materials, it'll make all library's a more healthy and stable enviornment for studying like it used to be used for.  Take out all the offensvie material, then they could put more educational books, movies, etc."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4505	2	"Hey my name is @PERSON1 and I have some things to talk about that people need to hear. I think that libraries are a good thing for people of all ages but, there are some books in the library that are not made for children to read or evan see. They should at least put them in a seprate part of the library.     I had an experince like this once. I was about to leave to go to the library when my little brother asked if he could come with me. I didnt want to take him but I couldnt say no to him. He got his shoes on and he ran to the door, he was so excited. We pulled up to the library and he took off running to the doors. I chased after him, when I caught him I told him that he couldnt run away from me like that. We went inside, it was a giant library. He went to find a book to look at and I went to find a good book to read. I found one that looked very interesting I got it and started to read it. Then @CAPS1 ran to me and said I should go take a look at the book he was looking at, so I went with him to go see the book. He handed it to me and I just lost it, the book was not a children book at all. I was one of the worst book that I have ever seen, we left the library and never came back.      I think that books that are bad for children should be in there own section in the library. This section should be for grown ups only and that no children are aloud in there. This is what I think sould be done to all libraries"	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
4510	2	"I think that censorship should be allowed in high school. For one, students who read books or watch the movies that are censorship can learn a lot from it.Also, I believe that if books are bad and not appropiate at school then why are they here? Movies that are not allowed becasue of its rating I think is lame because it might have pictures of naked people and bad language but we are high school students and we should be able to watch them because they are educational and we are mature enough to watch.Nevertheless, I believe that censorship is a good and bad thing but overally I think it should be allowed.     Therefore, books or movies that are censored, shouldn't be because I personally think that students learn better from recent rated r movies then some @DATE1 movied thats in black and white. Kids pay more attention to good interesting movies and the old movies most student fall asleep or just doesn't pay attention at all. So after that, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools.     If books and movies are so bad then why would they even have some here already. I think its foolish for teachers or administraters to think that we are to immature to watch rated r movies like every kid at school watches them at home,I believe. Yeah I know some movies show some scenes that arn't school related but who cares we will get over it. Overall I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools.     Well then last point is that all these helps us in a way if you really think about it. Get a classroom with computers and for a week let them listen to music while they work and for another week dont let them listen to anything than see which comes out better. Personally listening to music makes me concentrate better and keeps me on coarse to get my work done.SO therefore, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools.     So you got my opinion on censorship and I hope it helped you out to look at this situation better or clearer. I think rated r movies should be allowed at high schools and any music should to i mean its not like we are in prison,right? So there you got my opinion that censorship should be allowed at high schools"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4516	2	What impact does books that are for mature people have on kids? Recently people are trying to censorship libraries for what they seen what their kids are reading or have been acting lately. I disagree in censorshiping in libraries. Instead of censorshiping libraries maybe have a section for explict books or things for preventing little kids from reading them.     First of all instead of removing all the books maybe you should consider making a section for only for people of certain age. Make a section in at the back of the library and ask for @CAPS1 to confirm that there old enough.This would let the libarary keep all their books and would keep all their construmers happy and the most important keep the parents happy.     Another reason for not censorship libraries would be that the number of construmers would slowing drop. This would make the construmers unhappy and the library drop on its popularity for not having the books that people want to read.     I can also see why they are trying to censorship libraries because of the kids behaviors. With censorship in libraries this would keep the little kids from acting the way they do in a book. But @CAPS2 would be better just to not censorship libraries and keep the people who does read them happy.     At the end I disagree in censorshiping libraries because @CAPS2 would upset the people who read them and probably the library poplurity would drop which means people would stop visiting the library. So people that disagree should act now so libraries can stay how they are now	3	4		3	3	4	3

Say i wanted to write a book but people say it was too disgusting, i would still be able to write it and sell it. anything that anyone has a problem with they try to band or get rid of it. instead why dont they just get over it? we have rights every individual person from me to you we all have them, and should be able to use them to the full exstent of what they can be used for.     Call me old fashoned but, I beleive in freedom of speach and the freedoms that we have lost solders over and the freedoms we have every single day we live. I think drinking every @DATE1 of the week is wrong but, you dont see me on the news yelling about it no i deal with it just like people should deal with the things they dont like.      so i hope in this essay ive made good points in making sacrifices and dealing with things and not act on something you shouldent be able to change, thank you for taking the time to read this."	3	3		3	2	3	2																		
4526	2	"' Everyone in the world has an opinion, some people @MONTH1 find them offensive but there are also people who find it interesting and enjoy reading, listening, and watching the material. I personally have never had this kind of problem, i have only been to the library around @NUM1 times i generally rent movies. there are people who can noot deal with certain things like blood and guts or racism in books movis and music, but at the same time there are people who absolutely love it it's their thing.      I believe that it would be wrong to strip those of what they find interesting what they enjoy to read or watch and listen to. some people will say well its vulgar well the people will say that its a master peice or that what they are into is dull and has no interesting moral. Libraries generally do not have things that are to gory or things that have too much sexual content they might in books but not movies or magazines. Now music nowadays can be down right vulgar and disrespectfull, it can also be very sexual and contain lots of gang related violence which has become a large problem with our children.  Libraries generally have old school music like michael jackson, The @CAPS1, and slow jams like @CAPS2-kelly, and old smooth positive rap, good old country music, and nice soothing jazz. The music our children to nowadays has all of these depressing & violent morals that do not need to be shared with some of these young and imitatfull minds. I believe that they should not pull it off the shelfs but i do believe that you should have to be a certain age to acess these things.'"	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
4534	2	"Have you ever just read a book or a magazine that you just despised and thought that if that book was taken off of the shelf then it would save many people from a waste of time? Or have you ever read a book or heard a song that was not offensive to you, but to other people it might be offensive to their race or gender? A lot of people run into this problem and personally, I have ran into that problem, but that doesn't mean it needs to be taken off of the shelf. If everybody in the world goes to a library and grabs one book off of their own local library shelf to go and throw away, just one, that they absolutely despise because of their own personal reason or just because they didn't like it, there would barely be any books left!      If somebody has a problem with the material in a book, magazine, or song, then don't read it or listen to it. Other people @MONTH1 like reading about that topic, or like that kind of music. I understand that some books @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, but do not read it if you take it to offense. Books about slavery @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, but that is history and some people might like learning about that subject, or @MONTH1 even need that information for a research project. There are also many books on the @CAPS1, some people @MONTH1 find that offensive, or @MONTH1 not want their kids reading about that, but that is history. It's a time period in the past and it @MONTH1 be something a high school student is doing a research paper over. I have done a research paper over the @CAPS1 and I have read some very mature material that younger kids @MONTH1 not need to learn about right now, but I would not suggest to take every book over the @CAPS1 off of the shelves at our local library.     There are many different reasons for reading a book and if you want to read a book for enjoyment and you end up reading one that you find offensive, then choose a different topic to read about because some people @MONTH1 like reading about that topic. Just because a person doesn't like a book or the topic the book covers does not give anyone the right to take the book off of the shelf because they feel that it is sending a bad message to younger kids or might be offending to some people. If people do not want their kids reading about that topic then tell them when they go to check a book out at the library not to get a book over that topic.      If it becomes too big of a deal to where people begin to find a lot of books that offend them or other people, then suggest for the library to have a list of the books and their topics. Each library could be required to have a list of books, and have the suggested age of the readers beside it, or there could be different sections of the library. One section for kids, one section for teenagers, one section for adults, and one section for middle aged people. Also, if it absolutely needs to happen, each library can have computers to where you can look up the book and see what that book is about. This will give you an idea of what the book is about before you read it so if there is a certain topic that offends you then you can go ahead and find another book and find out what that one is about. This would help many people not read books that offend them and it would help them find a book that is more suitable for what they want to read about.      Songs are a whole other subject. An artist or songwriter will write, rap, and sing songs about what they want. If people find the profanity in the song offensive, then do not listen to it. There is no way that you can tell a song writer not to sing or rap about what they want, and stores are going to sell albums that give them business. If people do not want their kids around that kind of language or message that the song is giving off then they can just tell their kids not to listen to it, because artists are going to write songs, rap songs, and sing songs about what is going to make them money, and that is just a fact."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4536	2	"To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3:          Censorship, does @CAPS2 deserve a place in our society?      There has been much contreversy over this topic. Some claim that certain kinds of literature and music contain offensive lyrics or writings, while others, over the same topic, believe the complete opposite. They believe that the words of the artists and authors shows feelings and have messages hidden within words of vulgarity, which is where i stand on the situation.     @CAPS2 seems as though everytime we cross over this bridge, @CAPS2 comes right back in front of us. Many of those opposed to the freedom of writing and music are usually the ones that feel as if they must preform proper edicate and have everyone act nothing less of the same, unfortunately for many, the people that are like this, usually, have much power in the say of what comes and what goes, not allowing many of us lower graded people in society to get a chance to veto their poor outlook on things.      My opinions bring me to believe that there are two sides to this story too. However, I still believe that much of what is considered 'censored' material should not be censored at all. There is one, count that, one situation where I feel censorship is necessary. One is songs that go on for @NUM1 and a half minutes saying nothing but '*bleep* this, and *bleep that'.      All other material, whether @CAPS2 be @CAPS4 rapping or @PERSON1 writing, is acceptable. There's just many people in the world who need to grow up and listen to the lyrics/words, to get the full message before automatically assuming that there is a problem with @CAPS2. Great @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION1, he always has a message in his music, whether @CAPS2 be about family or just life in general, however many words he uses are considered unfit for our time, so you just hear '*bleep*' when @CAPS2 is on the radio. By just that '*bleep*', you can lose the message thats coming across.      Also, ever hear the phrase, 'equal rights'? Well, shouldn't music and literature be a right? @CAPS2's just like talking but with either pages or instruments. And that's how I will leave you on this debateable topic. I hope I might have changed some opinions of you today, if not then your loss. Thank you for your time.

4538	2	"Do you believe in hiding books and movies that are over @CAPS1? Do you think that children can control themselves with offensive behavor? Have you ever seen a child watch a scary movie that was @CAPS2 @CAPS3? Why do you think that most parents block that kind of viewings from their young children? I believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves from children, if they are found offensive.       I fully agree with adults not letting children watch that new scary movie or that action book their brother is reading. I think they should consider the effects that come with watching or reading certain things. Children at young ages still have their innocence. You don't want your child having nightmares because you let them watch a over @CAPS1 rating movie. You would feel guilty if the child has problems for the rest of their life.      You have to make a choice on whether the it's comfortable for them to view what their watching or reading! It's important to hid them so the child can not get ahold to them. Be wise of the kind of movies and books you leave around the library. You should have a section for children in libraries. You should have all the materials that a child should be interested in. It should be colorful and playful as possible.      I used to watch this girl named @CAPS5. I was babysitting her one night, while her parents were at the movies. I brung a movie to watch, when @CAPS5 fell asleep. So once the clock turned to @NUM1, I put her to sleep. But little did I know she woke up and @ORGANIZATION1 me watching this horror film called @ORGANIZATION1. It gushed blood everywhere and she started to sceam! I thought I had secured her in her bedroom, to go to sleep but to my surprise she was still woke! I rushed over to her and put her back to sleep. hoping she didn't have any nightmares.     Please be curtious to the things youlet children read or see. You have to think of the effects of what's going to happen to the child later in life. I know you think that it's not that harmful to children, but it can really mess up their minds and actions forever. So I hope I have persuaded you to follow my advice and pull them over @CAPS1 movies and books off the shelves for the safety of the children"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4544	2	"My opinion on this would be that , they are going to learn about @CAPS3 anyways so why take @CAPS3 off the shelfs ? No I don't think any adult material should be cencered . You know when your little girl or boy as about what they have in there hand , simple just take @CAPS3 from them and say '@CAPS1 your eyes can't handle .' @CAPS2 , they are going to ask questions and @CAPS2 , they will start to wonder , but they learn that stuff in school anyways so what's the big deal ?      If I had a child , who had got into my personal stuff and started asking questions , I would simply tell them '@CAPS3's a mommy and daddy thing ' , and then hide @CAPS3 in a diffrent place to where I know they can't find @CAPS3 . I mean , when you was a child , of course your parents would have yelled at you for going into there room and looking threw there stuff , but then again , you would yell at them for having @CAPS3 when they got older . So don't disaplin your children for @CAPS1 they 'stummbled' on to , you should learn how to hide your stuff better . I'm not saying I would have any of that stuff (why would I need @CAPS3 ?) but , as a student looking into the future , I have a opinion .     Now lets say that you have a couple of maginzines under your bed and your child happens to see them . @CAPS2 they will start looking at them , and some words might come out , but that does not mean they did @CAPS1 wrong , @CAPS3's the parents fault . Like I said before I would hide my stuff better but , then again , I don't need that kind of stuff to live a happy life , I have my children and my husband and that is all I'll ever need .     So before you parents decide to protest about the library having stuff that children are not suppose to see , check your room , hide your stuff so you wont be the embarassed one . No , a library can have whatever they want , @CAPS3's not your place to say what they should get ride of and what should stay.As a student , I stand up and say , No , adult material should not be banned from library's , then you would here the adults complaining and that is @CAPS1 we don't need ."	3	2		3	3	3	3																		
4549	2	"What I belive is that certain material should be allowed on a shelf. The time it takes an author to write a book, is very long. It could be their passion to write, so why would you want to take that away. Every person has an opinion, which is allowed to have by freedom. Material in libraries are sorted by age group, and as long as the material is fitted for that age group, there should'nt be a problem.      There are many books that some people do not want their children to read, but the books actually help children learn. For example, a book that you think is boring could actually be interesting to another person. There are many opinions in the world, that is why there are so many differnt kinds of books. If you took away a book or certain material off the shelf, how could that help a child. Yes it could have bad words or beliefs, but it could help someone. If a person is a loner or just likes to be by them selves, they could learn from the character's mistake in the book.           Many children these days are getting bullied or pick on, and don't want to tell an adult. If there was a book that they read about a person being bullied, maybe it would encourage them to tell a teacher. Yes I agree, every material has something in it that another person does not like. There are a couple books that I did not approve of, myself, but I know that it has connected with a child some where in the world. Every person does not grow up in the same conditions, but material could teach them.      You should stop and think if you was a writer, would you want someone to throw your hard work in the trash? Every time there is a big rally about an author writing about a certain belief, there is negative thoughts. No one stops and thinks about someone else or their family. All they care about is their own family. Even the author's family is embarassed of the rally, but no one stops and thinks of their family and how they feel.      Think about you opinion, does anyone care about what you think? That is why as a person, we should not bring down someone's opinion, and let them say what they believe on paper. How would you like it, if someone threw your belief or opinion in the trush? If there is a rally about a material in the library, next time think before you judge. Would you want someone judging your belief or opinion?"	3	4		3	3	4	3

Somethings people @MONTH1 find offensive others might enjoy. Its simple, if it comes to the point were people are causing problems then maybe that will be up to the people that work in the libraries. Yes, there @MONTH1 be alot of things that people take offensive, but that dose not mean take away the things others @MONTH1 enjoy. I have been to many libraries in my life. I have not really seen anything offensive, but I have seen some books and movies for adults only. Honestly in my eyes its simple, if there is something you find offensive just stay away from it, because others @MONTH1 enjoy it.     Its not up to me weather the materials should be removed from the library shelves. Although I do believe that people who find things offensive should just stay away from it.

4552	2	"There is material out there that some people consider offensive and or have material in them that we don't want our youth to indulge in. Such items can include music, books, and movies, but I am just going to give you some of my thoughts on the issue.     On materials, like music and movies, there are ratings on the item saying what age is apropriate for the content that the music or movie have in them. Like movies there are ratings such as @CAPS1 which means that you should be @NUM1 or older to view it. @NUM2 which is parental guidance or @NUM3 and up. PG means you should have your parents with for the younger kids. And @CAPS2 which is for all age groups. If there is something offensive and or the language is bad in music the cover will have a lable that says explicit content.     I agree with this. I don't think that they should take anything off of the shelf unless completely nescessary. If someone doesn't like the content in that item they have the option to not listen, watch, or read it. There are people out there that might disagree with me and I can see where they are coming from too. Say if there is a book discriminating a race than I agree that it should be taken off the shelves.      There are also people out there who are more leanent and others that are more strict. Just like parents for example. A lot of parents want to raise there kids in an envirenment where there is no swearing and violence, while other parents let there kids watch and listen to items out of there age group. Like with me my parents let me watch, read, and listen to what I want and in my opinion I turned out just fine, while others might not thing so. I have seen kids that had parents that weren't strict and let them indulge in these items and they turned out to be well behaved adults. Then there are also people you had strict parents and they turned out to be not so good of a person, and vise versa.      That is about all I have to say on the topic. You have seen my views and what I believe. In a summary I guess I could say that everyone has there own opinions and views"	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
4559	2	"As Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' As an author, she feels if she, and anyone else, has the right to take those uncensored books off the shelf, then there will be no books left. Depending on the person, some books @MONTH1 be offensive to some, but not all. I dont think that books should be able to be taken off the shelf by anyone because everyones preference on books can be different. I believe that libraries should keep unsensored books in a certain section, so children can easily be kept from seeing or reading unappropriote material at their age. And lastly, my own experience has led me to believe there should be a warning on certain books, saying not all the material could be appropriote.     People having the right to take any book off the shelf would be unfair for the people. The library is a quiet place, meant for people to come and read any type of book, do homework, study groups, and undergo research for practiaclly any topic, @CAPS1 the number of books based on one persons opinion is unfair to everyone else who might enjoy that genre. Libraries and books were one of the main resources for researching before there was internet and many eople still prefer books to this day. I think the freedom of taking any book off the shelf would be endangering the process of learning and discovering     To reduce the number of uncensored books being found by children or people who find them offensive, there should be a certain section in the library for just those books. That way, people who have an interest in those books can read them, but also they are kept away for those who dont want to read them. I think taking away any type of book is unfair to the people because everyone like different genres of books, so having uncensored books in one section is fair to all. It would also be easier on parents knowing their children wont find books with material in them that they shouldnt be reading.      By disagreeing with the right to take any book off the shelf, I think each book with any uncensored material should be marked with some type of sticker on the binding, just as a warning. If one sees that sticker and knows they dont want books with that type of material, then they can easily return the book with no argument. I have had experience with trying to find a book for a school project, but later finding there was material in it that really wasnt appropriote for school. This made me have to find a new book for the project. I didnt want to completely take the book off the shelf and away from any one else who wanted to read it, but a warning right then would of been easier in the situation.      In conclusion, I dont believe that certain materials should be taken off by just anyone. Taking away books would spark many disagreements because even though one person might find something offensive, doesnt mean every other person will. As mentioned before, putting the uncensored books in a different section and putting a sticker on the binding would give a clear warning to anyone not wanting to read unsencored books. I think every library needs to take into consideration of the topics above to help people reduce the issue of people or children finding uncensored books in just any section"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4563	2	"There has been a problem with censorship in libraries recently. Many books, movies, and music are being removed from libraries because they are found offensive. There are, however, libraries that do not remove items due to being offensive. There are many reasons as to why items are censored or not censored, but libraries should not have to censor certain items.     One reason why offensive material should not be removed is because material that is considered offensive could be given a label that warns people of the material in the book or movie. If a child tries to check out a book or movie that has a warning label, they would have to have a parent with them to approve the item the child is getting. Whether or not children read or see the offensive material is the decision of the parents.     Another reason offensive material should not be removed is because parents would have to approve the item that their child is getting. If they believe the material is too mature for their child, they could restrict them. If the item doesn't seem too harmful, they could allow it. That decision, however, is up to the parents.     Books or movies that are considered offensive could also be given their own section of a library. Children would not be allowed in that section without parental supervision. And that, again, is the decision of the child's parents.     There are many reasons why offensive material should not be banned. That sort of material, however, should have restrictions on who should and should not check them out."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4567	2	"Many people claim that certain books should be allowed on @CAPS1 shelves.  They claim that these books can be offensive to some and, therefore, should not be read.  These books are known as '@CAPS2 Books.'  @CAPS3, librarians, and public officials have gone too far in thinking they should have the right to choose who reads certain books and who does not.     In the novel To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5, the author uses many words and descriptions that people find are very offensive.  These words, however, are essential to the setting of the novel.  The author is not claiming that she personally feels that @CAPS6 @CAPS7 should be described in the way that they are, but a racist individual, such as @PERSON3 or many people during the time period, would not hesitate to describe them in such a way.  The novel, To @CAPS4 a @CAPS9, is a great way for people to understand the history of the @CAPS10.  Without the descriptions in the novels, a piece of history would unknown to many.     The novel, @PERSON4 in the @CAPS11, attempts to delve into the life of a pubescent, whiney, teenager.  The author, @PERSON2, uses many curses in the dialogue between characters.  The charachters, however, are high school boys that live at a boarding school.  To water down the language or to make the novel 'kid friendly' would make it impossible to describe the true nature of the characters.  The novel also contains multiple references to sexual situations.  These situations, although offensive to some, are necessary to show the progression of plot as well as the changing charachter traits of the protagonist, @PERSON1.     Literature is not the only medium being targetted by those trying to completely censor libraries.  Music, movies, magazines, and videogames are being targeted as well.  In many cases, certain materials should not be viewed by young children or those who lack the maturity to handle them.  It should be remembered that it is the @CAPS3 responsibility to censor materials for their children.  Instances of violence, prejudice, and death are a diurnal occurence.  @CAPS1 patrons should not be shielded from these occurrences.     In conclusion, many times it is necessary for an author to use words or descriptions that are offensive to many. Librarians should not be given control over which materials reach the shelves in libraries.  Libraries should present a wide variety of books, movies, etc. to the public.  If libraries do this, it becomes the responsiblity of either the @CAPS3 or the individual to pick out books that are within personal boundaries"	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
4568	2	"Works of literature are works of literature no matter what they contain.All liteature should be placed on the shelves of a library. If for some reason the material is offensive or deemed as crude then it should go into a restricted section where permission is required to enter. Literature is a strong item when it comes to persuasion. So we must take care of what we allow to be released or seen and to which eyes.     Literature is written by the author for many reasons. Perhaps the reason is to make money or to share a point of view but either way the author generally wants his or her literature to be read. How would the author ever achieve his or her goal if we decided to remove their hard work from the library shelves. It simply could not be read if it is not available. This is one reason why certain books should not be altogether removed from the library.     No matter how crude a topic @MONTH1 be it @MONTH1 still be needed by certain individuals. If there were images of a nude person in a scientific book that librarians did not want children to get their hands on then how would students study a topic such as sexual education or anatomy for a class? Of course there are people who simply want to see nudity for foolish pleasure and that is why permission should berequired to obtain these books. A small closed off room in a library should be sufficient to contain all the books deemed crude. This way the only access to the books would be to get a key from a librarian.     A book not read @MONTH1 as well never have been written. There is absolutely no point in destroying certain types of literature because some @MONTH1 feel offended. The simplest solution would be to simply make it so the only people to view these books would want or need to go view them. We simply can not lose certain pieces of writing because some parents do not trust their childs eye or because a person @MONTH1 be offended at the material. After all, when everybody has a chance to say what is offensive there will be no books left."	4	4		4	4	4	4

If I seen a book and I knew I wasnt suppose to read but then I knew it was  good music, book, or magazie. I would get it cause thats what children do explore. books are here to read and to look at i feel if you know im not suppose to read it make me show prof of age or not give it to me.          Really dont understand why sum books be in stores and people dont want u reading them. Sum children dont read at all and to see them to pick up a book, @CAPS2 down to read should be good eoungh. But there is always a age group thats not suppose to read some books. But at the smae time you cant keep the child away from the world, and what it brings you. The book are put there for a reason and not just to be walked past.          I feel like the reason why children listen to music is that some time the track relate to them in a way that a other person would not understand. So they feel the song other thren what another person would hear just the @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and @CAPS6. Thats not what sum parents want you to hear.     Magazines tells alot of things and show to much for the younger minds. Im a father my self and would want my son at the age of @NUM1 looking at any naked girl or adds about pron in @ORGANIZATION1 books or any of that kind. parents can sometimes be over hard on a child and not let them do a lot of things. But they feel that they knows whats best for u. What ever  they tell you is not wrong cause the @MONTH1 have been through it already. That would only lead to them doing things behide there backs. But if they want learn the easy way its aways the hard way."	2	2		2	2	2	2

Students must the right to remove the book from the library if he or she gets offended, or sometimes if there is a student who has came from a different @CAPS2 and they might get offeneded by the movies or music that are in the library.      Books are most commonly used in the library. In those books, there are some book that are offensive to some student, and if one student find something offensive, he should have the right to remove the book from the library shelve. Many students like fiction books, which are true story but it might have some kind of offensive language or something that the student is feeling racist to him. School or any public library should remove books that contains inappropriate words that are not good for the kids to learn in their life.      Music is also one of the important thing that is carried in any school library or any public library. Most common type of music that you can find in the library is @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3 music. Most of the times those kinds of music might not carry and bad words, racistism or any offensive language, but some of the songs might carry something that is not apporpriate for school use. Those kinds of music must be remove from any school library or any public library.      Movies are also carried in some library, but not every library carries a movie. Some of the movies might have blood scenes, abusive language, which might not be apporpriate for some childrens who are at school. You should check the rating of the movie that you are checking out of the library or if you are watching it at home or any other places. Movies might carry some kind of rasictism in them.     Library is a good source for reading books, listening to music, or watching a movie. While you are reading a book or watching a movie, you might find words which might not be apporpriate for yourself or for students who read those books. These movies, books or music can carry abusive language or something that is rasict to some people who came from a different @CAPS2. Student should have the right to remove something that is not apporpriate in school use, such as, books, music and movies, if they contain something that is not suppose to be in it, you should remove it"	3	3		3	3	3	3

Sure, it's educational but it also can demoralize some people's thoughts and feelings. One way to get rid of this problem is censorship, or taking a specific book out of the hands of the public.     We all have poked fun at people, whether it is to hurt them or just give them a hard time, it can hurt people. Same way with the media. Books, magazines, @LOCATION1, and the internet all are competing for the success and money of its viewers, and the best wat to do that is to appeal to the audience. Give them what they want. For some reason everyone wants to demoralize people, and that is where I think it @CAPS1 the @CAPS3. Stand up for your rights and censor out those things that will lead to worse lives of those to come.     Censorship @MONTH1 just be a big word to most people, but it carries a big problem. For me, it @CAPS1 the @CAPS3 whenever racism is a problem or else vulgarity is an obscene message. The music we listen to can get really intense. I'm a victim of the harsh music that we play more and more of today. Atleast the radio is trying to do better at this whenever they 'bleep' out the curse words or else persuade the artist to make clean lyrics that they play on air. That is where places are trying to clean things up. Make tomorrow be a better place than today.     With all of these new @CAPS5 (Music @CAPS6) shows and other reality sitcoms making air on @CAPS6, it has opened the door to crudeness all over. They try to do a better job of cleaning it up in the sense of picture, censoring out body parts and on the worldwide coverage stations their mouths. Other stations like @CAPS5 don't do anything about the voices and the vulgarity people are showing and feeling towards each other.     Books are another thing that could use some censorship. @CAPS2 teacher used to tell me, '@CAPS8, if you can't read it out loud to me, then you shouldn't probably be reading it.' and I agree. With the technology and all the other things, children are more vulnerable to these harsh words and actions. Thus, leading towards a society who can't trust anyone and easily turns to vulgarity when need be.     With the world today, it is quiet easy to listen to the uncensored version that is shed from the radio. One person tries to make tomorrow a better place but the next tries to demoralize it. It's one thing if your angry and upset and are standing up for your rights but it's not whenever you do it for the fun of it. That is where it @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4585	2	"Yes, some materials,such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are offensive.Yet they shouldn't be removed from shelves.Reason number one is: @CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. Reason number two is:'offensive' material will @CAPS6 be out in the world.And finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their children from reading them and not the rest of the world. In @CAPS2 following essay, I will explain thoroughly my reasons for an opinion as such.     '@CAPS1 is one man's trash is another man's treasure.' @CAPS2 quote goes very well with the first reason: @CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. People's views about everything could be significantly different. For example, a book about @PERSON1 killing the @CAPS3 could be offensive to someone with @CAPS4 descent, meanwhile,a book filled with cursing could be offensive to a religous person. As you can see,'offensive' is defined differently by different people.     Offensive material will @CAPS6 be out in the world. Parents can't shelter their child from these things forever. At one point in their lives, children will learn offensive things and parents won't be able to do anything about that. Children have actives mind that pick up on everything around them. If they learn from these offensive materials, then parents should teach them @CAPS1 is wrong and @CAPS1 is right.     Finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their children from reading them and not the rest of the world. @CAPS2 reason ties in perfectly with the first. Parents can't decide @CAPS1 the parents of other children should do. They can only do something about @CAPS1 their children are doing.     Therefore, my belief on censorship in libraries is nonexistant for the following reasons. @NUM1.)@CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. @NUM2.)Offensive material will @CAPS6 be out in the world. And @NUM3.)If parents don't want their children reading offensive material,they should only ban their own children from reading them and not the rest of the world. Thus, there should be no censorship in libraries"	3	4		3	3	4	3																		
4590	2	"I say tht they shouldn't take off books that are found affensive and im going to say why I think that.I think that they shouldn't take off those books because thats the way it was written, and if the person that finds that book offensive then just don't read it.Another reason they shouldn't take it off its because a author wrote it but im sure that he didn't think that a person was goin to find it offensive.My third reason they shouldn't take it off the shelf its because the book might be really good and interesting, except for tht one person that thinks its offensive.I just told y'all why I think they shouldn't take the book off the shelf just because one person says so."	2	3		2	3	3	3

Mine are different from every one elses'. I mean I @MONTH1 find it offensive, but how is everyone else going to see if it is or not, if you take it off the shelf?     Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. What we do, believe in, or think is what makes us ourselves. Just because one person finds a book, music, or some movies offensive, doesn't mean everyone else will. Others might happen to like it even if you don't.     Taking something away just because you think it is offensive, is like taking a little part of some one away. It's like the school making kids wear uniforms, it takes our individuality away. We all have to have some way to express ourselves and maybe the thing you find offensive, expresses some one else in some way.    There is going to be a lot of things in life that people don't like, but can you really just get rid of it all? It does not work like that. You are not always going to have your way in life, but it's life and there is nothing you can do about it. Just because you don't like something or you find something offensive, doesn't mean you can just remove it or replace it.     Life just goes as planned and there will be things that you don't like, but you can't change that. It is life and replacing or removing things won't make things easier. So if I found something offensive, I'd just ignore it and leave it there because is taking it off the shelve really going to help?"	4	4		4	4	4	4

Even as we speak there might be a battle going on somewhere or somthing very importent is about to happen in other contrey. We will need this informaion all the time. There's this old saying that I read in a book once, 'You can not juge a man until you claim under his skin and walk around in it'. It took me awhile to understand what they mean't by that. Then, I finely understood what they really mean't. You can't juge someone by their outer looks, you must juge their inner personaltiy.When you look at a book, movie, magazines, etc., you can not juge it until you see it for yourself. Compony people create these things for certain people that enjoy the things they love. Tv shows, newspapers, books, etc. All the things to make them happy.We must enjoy what we have in this life.

4599	2	"Should materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines be removed from the shelves if they are offensive? I don't think so, because it might not be offensive to every body, it would be brakeing the law, and it's not fair to the artist that created them.     Just because it's offensive to one person donsn't mean it is offensive to everyone. For example, some people might think the @CAPS1 is offensive, while to others, it's there religion. It would just go to show that one mans garbage, is another mans tresher.     It would also be braking the law, because it would not be giving the artist their freedom of speech. It would silense all the great artist out there, trying to be herd. They should be able to write, sing, or film what ever they want. It is their right to do so.     That is the resion why they souldn't be removed from the shelves. It wouldn't be fair to the artist that created them, it would be braking the law, and what one person thinks isn't what every one thinks"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4601	2	"Your @CAPS1     @CAPS2 are many things done and said in this world today that people take offense to.  It could be something someone said about one's relgion, or taking away @CAPS1 of others. Do you believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and articles should be taken off the shelves at stores just because people find it offensive?  I don'@CAPS3 believe it should work that way.  @CAPS2 are a variety of different relgions, races, and beliefs in this world, so if we took something off the shelf everytime found it offensive we would have nothing left to sell.     When it comes to younger children they are not going to know what to think and believe. When seeing and hearing things, children start to believe it.  The media that adults find offensive should not be published and out in the open for children to see and listen to. Even though the kids @MONTH1 not take offense to any of the media, you still have to think about the parents and what they believe is right for their children. Many effects on life are put into the media everyday for everyone to see, and some parents @MONTH1 not find it suitable for their children to be hearing about it.  Drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big effect on children and their lives today. I believe it is our responsibiltyto protect from all harm until they are old enough to fight for themselves, and make their own judgements.     Our religion is a big part of your life because it determines what we believe in, and in we think is right or wrong. Your parents teach you the way they want you to act and teach you the difference between what they think is right and wrong.  I was taught to always be respectful to others and try my hardest in whatever it is I @MONTH1 do.  Some people @MONTH1 have an actor or actress as their role model, so whenever they see that certain person on @CAPS3.V., you tend to think that whatever they do is okay for you to do.  Some parents @MONTH1 take offense to a show on the television because they don'@CAPS3 believe that is right for their kid to be watching.  While others don'@CAPS3 see a problem with it.  So if we cancel that show on @CAPS3.V., you are making one family happy and many others upset. When it comes to the movies, people have their own different ratings for movies, but the state rates them whenever they come out.  Now at movie theaters you must be eighteen to see a @CAPS5 rated movie, or you must have a parent with you because you going by yourself and your parents not knowing get upset those of manys.  With libraries and movie theaters they have what the state thinks is for adults only in their own little section. My parents believe that if @CAPS2 is a law for something it is @CAPS2 for a reason and we are going to obide them.  As with some parents they have their own rules.  Such as some parents think it's okay for their children to drink under age as long as they stay home with them and they know what is going on.        A few years ago my little cousin was watching a movie with me that was rated @CAPS6.  I didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it and just turned they movie on and we watched it.  It had a few words in it that his parents didn'@CAPS3 agree to him watching, and he really liked the movie.  His favorite quote from the movie was something his parents did not want him hearing at his age.  He didn'@CAPS3 know any better and since he thought it was so great, he was walking up to people saying that quote.  His mother was not happy and asked where he had heard it from and he told her the movie, and she didn'@CAPS3 think that he needed to be saying that and he got in trouble.  I told her it was my fault, I let him watch the movie and didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it because my parents let me watch it when I was his age.      It just comes to show that, @CAPS2 are many different things in this world today that not everyone is going to agree on.  So if we took something off the shelf because someone took offense to it, we would have nothing left in this world today.  We learn about the things we do in life because the state has requirements that have to be passed.  What we learn outside of school is up to your parents based on what they believe.  So if @CAPS2 is something out @CAPS2 you don'@CAPS3 believe in stay away from it, and let those who do believe in it enjoy learning about it"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4606	2	"I believe that some materials we have in our shelf belongs to basically anybody in the world.  I also think that the materials on that shelf is allowed to be removed as long as those materials get put back in that spot no matter what.     My experiance with books are not really that great but i do like to read at times when i have the spare time to read. When i get a book i look at the book and i observe it so that way when i take it out of the library i know i wanted to read that book and observe the great thing about the book.when i read the book im not a very fast reader but when im reading i like to know how this book is gunna end and how it begans. If i was to pick a magazine from the library i wouldn't take it out of the library cause magazines are expensive to get at times and also hard to replace if it was ever needed to be replaced. But if i was to get one i would look at the important stuff on what it is and how to get it and all that kind of stuff. their are times when i think movies shouldn't able the library cause people could take ideas off of movies and/or steal them. movies in libraries would be expensive to pay if it was tooken from the library. if i was to watch a movie i would enjoy it as much as possible cause once that day comes to turn it in their is no chance of watching it after i turn it in. Music is passion to most people. most people would just go out and buy some cd's or something to listen to and their are music i would listen to so that i get an idea on what to play if i ever wanted to become an musician or something like that. their are times when i would write down the lyrics to a song so that way i can understand what the singer is singing about, either that or listen to the song over and over again.     My point is if something comes off the shelf is should return to its rightful spot or otherwise their will be consequences and people will not be trusted much longer"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4609	2	"Libraries are places of learning. Books, magazines, movies, and all types of media are placed there for the same specific purpose: to learn and explore. When we visit libraries, we expect to find the information that we came there looking for. Whether the topic is something as simple as wanting to learn about a type of flower or researching the infamous 'In @CAPS1 @CAPS2', we want the truth and information in its rawest form.      Materials should never be denied from the library. It always has some kind of value. Whether it be for cultural,spiritual, entertainment, or whatever kind of purpose, books can serve as a purpose for information and exploration into a new world. Books that are viewed as 'censored', are only being viewed from one standpoint. Another person might find this book exactly what they are looking for. If someone sees a book as 'offensive' they must step into another person's shoes and see where they are coming from; where this type of information @MONTH1 be helpful to someone else. Touchy issues such as the @CAPS3 or books to do with religion @MONTH1 be considered censored, but that's only concerning one group of people. What about the other percentage?     Now, don't get me wrong. I don't think that racy or graphic movies or magazines should be allowed into the library, but any type of material containing legitiment cultural, educational, entertaining, and others of the sort, purposes should ever be denied from the library. From working at a local library, I know that when people sign up to be a member of the library they sign an agreement that they know what kind of materials they can check out. So forth for agreeing with what they're allowing to let their children check out. If parents and guardians think that libraries are pushing censored content on their children, they should read the fine print! They are allowing their children to be exposed to this. And all 'this' is, is information and entertainment in the raw.      Libraries are created to allow an open access to information for anyone. These materials should include information on any topic the library can get in their possession. None should be denied. People rely on libraries as a source of knowledge, and we need to work to keep that source ever growing"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4616	2	"I thnk the censorship in libraries @CAPS1 quite abominomal. I think there should be no censorship, it @CAPS1 for the parents to decide what children can an cannot watch. I think if something @CAPS1 found offensive, then don't watch it, it's as simple as that. If you don't want your children to watch anything offensive or rude, then don't let them.     What I think offensive, @CAPS1 when something @CAPS1 removed off shelves. I think kids, though not yung kids, perhaps @NUM1 and up, should be able to watch and listen to what they want. I think certain things that people find offensive, are only offensive to those kind of people. It @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else, so don't take that particular movie, or song out of libraries.A good example of this would be the book, To @CAPS2 A @CAPS4. It has been banned and then unbanned from many school libraries, because of its vulgar words and references to rape. i think that @CAPS1 unfair because , wether we like it or not, children @NUM1 and over will most definatly hear rude and offensive things anyways.      I think books, or movies, or music, that have curse words, @CAPS1 a part of life, because most adults curse. And taking those things away from a library @CAPS1 taking it away from adults as well as kids. It @CAPS1 for the parents to decide when their kids hear these things, if at any time. I also believe that using ' offensive' remarks, @CAPS1 just another part of our history. Take To @CAPS2 A @CAPS4 for instance, back in that time, it was common for black people to talk slang, and common for men to curse when mad. That @CAPS1 just how people are and were.      Taking those things off the shelves, will not protect adolescents from hearing them. I think they have rights to hear it if they want, and there parents have rights enough to let them. I think songs that have words bleeped out over the radio @CAPS1 pointless because you teenager will know what they say anyway. I think having books banned @CAPS1 a not wise thing to do, because it just makes kids want to hear the word more than usual.     Basically we have rights to hear and read those things. Taking away the things we have rights to, @CAPS1 taking away our freedom and free will. If parents don't want to have their children read or hear those things, then they need to supervise what they read or listen to.

If they are not something that the kids should learn about then why put them on the shelves. Many of the books that children, teens, and adults read is a cause of a lot of violance and threating.That's a major cause these days and we want a clam a peaceful world.     Many of times we see teens to childern get into fights or have bad mouth to others. It's not a good thing to see and its mostly because they are either watching a @CAPS3 show about negtive things or reading a book or just trying to act cool. If we could put more important learning books, movies, and ect.. there would be less aggression in the world. Having a more positive day and going out and saying I read @ORGANIZATION1 wonderful book that taught me something new in life would be the best thing to hear.     Teaching something that a kid could remember or is helpful in the long run is the greatest thing. Knowing that they are doing anything educational is just a great feeling. Now when do you see kids actually doing what they are supposed to. You really dont cause they are too busy wanting to find trouble to get into.

The same idea for movies, magazines, music, ect. Even though, some parents do not accept it for their young children to read or watch uncensored materials from the library, it is the parents' role to supervise their children and choose for them and teach them what is right and what is wrong to read or watch.      Libraries usually require @CAPS1 cards. These @CAPS1 cards allow the person to have access to adults' materials depending on the kind of card the person has. Since it is the parents' decision to decide the materials their children have access to, they shouldn't blame anyone if their chilren have taken something they don't like off of the shelf. Libraries have done everything that needed to be done to have complete safety for the society.      If we try to remove every single book, movie, song, or magazine that contain an offensive thing, we would have to remove almost everything. People have different cultures and beliefs. They might think some things are offensive while other take it as a normal thing.      In the current society, a lot of people are more attratced to movies or music that contain some unappropriate materials because these materials have recently taken over in the media. We can't stop publishing them but we can censor them. There are different kinds of channels that view these materials. Internet, @ORGANIZATION1, and libraries can all be under parents' supervision. Thus, parents can not blame anyone other than themselves, if their children read or saw unacceptable materials.

Books, magazines, music can cause children or adults to have a big imagination and as they grow or are thinking that its a right way to do things. All this things that are not for a proper use shoud be displade of were no children or adult have it in use. I believe that this can hust people as they grow up or adults thinking its the right way to do things. Books and music should be removed if not used for something that is in good use.      Books magazines that have no material use and its used for pornagrafi or something else should be taken off shelfs. Kids and as adults have a big imagination that could sometimes hurt others as well as family members. Book magazines and music provide imspiration not to come to the fact that it comes to peoples distraction.thesse are way that by sometimes not knowing u hurt ur love one because of what u see, read or hear.this can the be the biggest effects on people.      The supplies you get like books, magazine, and music arent helping you and are caousing more problems in your life they should be take of markets. Also people sometimes decied to buy them beacause of what the pictures have instored for you in a good day. another thing that causes them to be taken of shelfs is the thought that u can get by looking and hearin and reading.This are all bad things for anybody to be ready or lisening to.     I belive that books, magazines and music should be taken off because its nothing good for the brain and it dosnt help you in any way. Also things that arent used for good are not use full.In my opinion, I think that trashy books and music sometimes it can take you to suiside or into making something cazy that later on you will regret.This is why nun od thoese things are use full for a person or a child     In conclusion, I think that books, magazines and music that are not use full shoul be taken of shelfs and should be putting things that do help the mind.Things that are not resorsful for a person mind should be put away.All this things came into not having estability in life and cometing rong steps that take you into failure.Finaly I think that all unresorsful books, magazines and music should be put away"	3	3		3	2	2	2

People like different books movies magazines ect., and some of the greatest movies of all time, well im pretty sure some people find them offinsive in some way. What some might find offinsive, others might think different. Like in magazines my aunt finds them offinsive because of the bathing suit modles in it for addvertising a new swim suit. or for addvertising liquir.

Cencorship is important to libraries when used correctly.     We need books for many things from learning to simply use up time. Music has been with mankind since the beginning. Movies show us the ups and downs of life. Magazines inform us on what new and interesting. These things have become imprtant to us as clothes and food. Simply taking these out will make the world will make it a darker palce to live.      Some of these things will cause people to be offended without trying to be. Katherine Paterson says that if I had the right to get rid of a book that offended me then everyone can too and soon all of the bookes will be gone .. We can try to be nice to every one, but somepoint something will insult someone no matter what we do or say. Do we need to get rid of everything for that reason?"	2	2		2	3	3	3																		
4640	2	"Taking books off a shelf at libraries because someone thinks they are offensive? I dont think that is right. Thats just what one person thinks and other people I'm sure won't think the same way. Just because one person think something is offensive and should be taken off that shelf doesn't mean that some kid couldn't learn from that book. Also with music, movies, and magazines, well that you can get that everywhere else so why is it such a bad thing to have it a library?   A lot of kids go to libraries to find books they need for school and if people are taking books off the shelf that they need, then how are they supposed to get their work done? Im sure there are people out there that would say the books they need are something they shouldn't be leaning yet, but we are going to have to learn about it sometime, so why not now?   Taking away music? kids can just get on the internet and get that just as easy and most kids are doing it in ways that could get them in trouble. So having music at libraries is just giving them a free way to get it.   Magazines you could just go to a store and get but a lot of kids probably don't have the money to buy them so having them at a libraries would give them a way to be able to see them. As long as it is stuff that kids can see then i don't see what is wrong with libraries having them there.   So i think taking books, music, magazies, and movies away form libraries isn't a very good thing to do. Maybe they could make an adult area and if someone tells them they think a book should go in there then they can look over it and see if it should. I can see some stuff getting taken away but not very much and if you take all that away from a library then you dont really have much of a library anymore."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4644	2	"Libraries are normally a safe quiet place for people to go set down drink a cup of coffee and read a book/magazine, search the internet, or listen to some of there favorite music.  But, some people don't use it as that.  They think it is a time to goof around and disrespect other people that are trying to have some time just to them selves while there children are away or had a bad day and to regroup and get ready for the next day. But then we ask our selves why do people want to set at a library and read.  Why can't they just check out a book, cd, or magazine and take it home? Why do people think it is such a big deal to be able to check out books, magazines, music, and movies from the library?     I don't see what the big deal is to this! Most counties have a public libarary.  That is meaning they will accept anyone that is interested in looking at there stuff.  Yes, I can see libraries making the person checking out a book sign a letter or document, giving personal information as in a telephone number, address, or credit card number.  The letter would be saying that they have this much time with this book and they needed it back on a certain date or else they need to bring it back in a get it renewed so they can't accuse of anyone stealing a book if they just want it for a little bit longer.  Most places have what they call late fees.  Normally, if someone has a late fee then you aren't going to get that book back because they don't want to pay it so I feel as if giving them a credit card number they can just keep charging there account and get the money that way for the late fees. Because they can just not answer your phone call or they can just throw away a letter that they recieve in the mail from the libabry in the trash.      I know our school library here at @ORGANIZATION1 has always had problems with getting books back and not paying late fees. This problem is sometimes a never ending process with certain people because some of them just don't care.     Yes, the internet would be a little diffrent because not everyone has money to get the internet at there house.      I am not writing this letter to gripe or be annoying I am trying to tell you some of my ideas that I have to keep a library up and running and not all junkey.  My ideas to me are good ideas and I feel like we can put Libraries into good use around this county and @LOCATION1"	2	3		2	3	3	3																		
4647	2	"Should certain books, movies, and magazines be removed from library bookshelves if found offensive? I believe that libraries should remove materials that are offensive. Libraries are huge public places that share knowledge and entertainment to enormous groups of people who want to expand their knowledge. Throughout the @LOCATION1 and other countries there are libraries that hold offensive material. Now I strongly believe in throwing out these offensive items because little children could grab one in their hands, there could be people that can be influenced to do stupid activities that they have learned, and some people might steal these items for themselves.     Libraries are important resources that tons of different groups of people come to enjoy, relax, and think. Now all over the countries libraries have offensive material that should be romoved from their shelves. Little children and their parents come to the library because a library is a great way to relieve stress and to let children learn. Say there are materials that are not suitable for children so they grab it and started reading. Next thing you know your children will have that type of knowlegde and you can't do a thing about it. Offensive material are around little kids and parent don't even know. They could gain offensive language or talk about it at school and that material could spread. Material like that at the library can harm children brains by brainwashing them.      Teenagers are becoming of age to where they might do something regretable. Teen often go to the library to meet up with friends, or start on homework. Then a person who is inmature spots a book and begins to read. After that he or she thought that it was extremely funny and wants to try it at home, but then gets badly hurt. Teens can be influenced by anything and what's worse is that it can start at the library.      Then there are people who just come into a library and steal the offensive material for themselves. People like that are inmature and could serve a real problem for the library. Once having that item in their grasp; they could post it on the internet and show the whole world what he or she found. Offensive material could be easily stoten from a library; if these certain items were not at the library then rebels wouldn't be stealing anything from the library.     Libraries are for different people who want to learn and teach others about their newly obtained knowledge. Libraries have the absolute best resources a place could have or ever wanted. I don't want such a wonderful resource be tainted by these obsence materials. That is why I strongly believe that certain material  such as books, magazines, movies, and music that are offensive should be removed from libraries."	4	5		4	4	4	4																		
4655	2	"Do I believe that certain materials, suchs as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed for being offensive? No I do not. My opinion on the varieties of things found in our library are good. Most of it is very helpful information. Some people might not like some things because of what they have in it or on them, but most of it is history. You can't change that. If someone doesn't like a book, movie, or magaine, they shouldn't read it.     I have found the things in our libraries to really help on a lot of projects. If we need to know about slaves or slavery, we can go to our library. Some peoples views on that is totally different, but hey. We can't help what people did in the past. We can only learn from their mistakes. I say if you don't like what you see on the front of the cover, don't read it. Look for something else more interesting to you.      I have not found one thing in our library offensive to me. Or even bad. They have books over everything. Some of it can be bad, but mostly it all is good information. They talk about history, and guns and drugs, and wars and all sorts of other history information. There are books over stuff that isn't even true.     I think people @MONTH1 over react on some things. If you don't like a book or movie, don't get it. Look at the cover and if it seems appealing, get it. But if not, don't waste time on complaining about it. Because then things can get out of control.      That is my opinion on books, movies, magazines, etc in our libraries. Mainly they seem very helpful, but others can have different opinions"	4	3		4	3	3	3																		
4656	2	"I think there should be no books taken off the shelfs. Somethings might be offisive to some people but other people might need those books for a research, projects,etc. People need to read to understand why some people think that somethings are offensive toward other people. Every book should be on a book shelf in a public library. Everybody has the freedom to choose for thier self, let them decide if it is offensive to them and others.     Maybe an author wrote a book about gansters, and their kids. Maybe the author wrote the book to give you an inside look on somebody's life. We live in a very diverse world they are going to be different outlooks on the world. The author could be writing the book to show you what that child went throught during that point of life with killings, and violence. That should not be offensive to somebody because they are talking about killings and violence. Reading that book should let you see how that child grew up. The book could even change some of the childs parents who are in gangs their minds. It could let them realize how it will have an effect on their childs life later on in life.     I believe the same thing goes for movies and magazines. Through reading the magazines and watching movies it could help you. Say if you are in a gang and you watch movies and read you would find out what happens to the gang, it could change your thoughts. These books, movies, magazines could show what is going to happen to you. Maybe directiors/ writers do these types ot thngs to show you what will happen to you if you continue down the path in gangs and harmful clubs.      Why should certain people get to choose if a book, moive, magazine,etc is offensive to some people but not others? I think the only way to fix it is to leave every book on public library shelfs. Let the peple who come to the library to read books decide what is right or offensive for them to read. Even if library's make a decision somebody is going to get mad and upset. I do not think there is any way to solve an issue like this except letting people read and decided for themself. If they like the book great, if not then  do not read it again or return the book.Nobody can decide right from wrong for somebody, only you can do it for your self."	4	4		4	3	4	3

4659	2	"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson, an author, once said. I think that she was trying to tell us that some books should not be out on the shelves for children to read. I agree with her on that statement.     I have once read a book with very mature content. It was very vulgar and not sutable for my age or maturity. There are a lot of books like that out there and we need to hide them from the children of our society. They are too young to hear or read about adult actions such as: war, violence, sex, drugs, and all sorts of other things.     If we take these mature books and other types of media off the shelves our children will have better lives. There would be less teen pregancies, drug ussage, and multiple other factors that are effecting our society. Children would behave better because they would not be so greatly influenced by the media. I think that we shouldn't get rid of these book though. We should just keep them out of the libraries. If people want to read these kinds of books they should search elsewhere. An easy way to solve this problem is to put an age limit on books and media of this content and to put them in a separate store or section in the libraries.     A very great author said that children should not be exposed to adult content in the media. But she also said that the people who read or watch this type of media have every right to. This is why there needs to be an age limit on this type of media. But for now if the content is to adult for you or does not agree with you, don't read or watch it."	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
4667	2	"Censorship in librarys can be a positive and negative thing. I think this because there can be somethings that you @MONTH1 not want your children to read. But there also can be things that you do want them to read. Age groups can play a big role in censorship because there are things that you dont want to see a kid reading when he or she is young. But if it is censored then they will not even be able to read it when they get older. It all depends on what kind of things are in the books, music, movies, and magazines.     If you find something offensive that you read in a book or saw in a magazine to some people that @MONTH1 not be offensive at all. This is why I think that the censorship can be good and bad. I am sure that there @MONTH1 be somethings that you have read that wasn't offensive to you but it @MONTH1 still be offensive to others. Censorship in my opinion can be a good thing when the things that are in the book, movie, magazine, and music are not true and that @MONTH1 be offensive to more than a small group. Lets say that there are two books written about the same true topic. The first books material is very well written and @MONTH1 have offensive material in it here and there. The second book is also well written but @MONTH1 not all be there the whole story @MONTH1 not be the same as what happened because they censored it because it can't be in the library. Which would you rather read? Personally I would rather read the book that @MONTH1 have some offensive material but has the complete story of what happend.     Say you were the writer of a book and it took you a long time of hard work and dedication to finish the book and get it published. Would you want your book to be on the shelf at the library? I know I would but if your writing about something that happend in your life that could have been offensive to others they @MONTH1 not allow that book on the shelf of a library. If the things that are in the book are true or are in real life. Than why show your children a book that isn't true? Im not saying go get your child a war book and have them read it when they are very young. When reading a book that someone spent a long time and lots of hard work on you are looking into their perspective. Maybe there perspective of what happend is alot different than yours, but that can be a good thing. Even with the offensive material books, movies, magazines, and music can still be good to some people and bad to others.     I have went to librarys and found books that I was interested in and I think that some of them could be found offensive to others. If the contents of the book, movie, magazine, and the music are not true and can be found offensive then sure that should be censored. But if it is censored it should only be for a certain age group. I have also went and got books at the library that have true stories that can be found offensive by some people, but that doesn't mean it should be censored. A book that @MONTH1 have material in them that could be 'bad' for some people. That does not mean that after they read it they are going to go start using the same offensive language that could be in the book. It all depends on the persons perspective if they find a book offensive or that has some 'bad' material in it then don't read it, and find something that you wouldnt find offensive.     Overall the things that we read, watch, and listen to @MONTH1 not all be bad even if it has some offensive material in it. To some it can be bad to others it can be part of their life. If I had a story to tell and I spent a long time working on it. I would want it to be read, seen, and heard. Censorship @MONTH1 be good for some and bad for others. If you are a person that allways likes a happy ending then maybe censorship is good. But if you want the whole story that can be non-fiction or fiction then censorship is not for you."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4669	2	"Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, or music should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I do believe so. The reason why is because there can be a lot of books, movies, or magazines in certain places like the library or stores that can involve offensive stuff, such as violence or other bad things. A lot of things can influence to the reader if they read a book that is offensive or if a kid see's a movie that involves violence.     One reason I think that books should be removed from the shelves is if they are found offensive  because what if the reader is reading the book and they find a word that offends them? Or what if they read a book and it talks about bad stuff? Or maybe a kid can read a book and can learn bad stuff. A lot of things can just occurr while reading a book. And many people sometimes take it real offensive if the book talks about there religion, race, or anything that involves to there personal life. That's why I think books should be removed off the shelf, so people will not get offended.     Another reason will have to be that if a kid or someone under age rents a movie or there parents rent the movie. Then the kid would probably want to see the movie and they would not know what the movie is about. The kid might see something that is bad or might see a lot of violence. Sometimes parents don't really realize what there kid's are watching. So it's important for them to learn and watch for there kids. In movie's anyone can  see a lot of bad thing that can effect anyone or can offend anyone. So I think that they should not have certain  movies on the  shelves that can harm or offend certain family or parents, espicially there kids.     Magazines can also be found offensive to a lot of people. Whenever you go to the store you always see magazines on the shelves or somewhere else. It's either talking about singers, people divorcing, violence that ocurr around the world, arrests, or it could even have bad images that anyone could see. Which would be something bad, especially if a little kid picks up a magazine that has soemthing bad inside. That's why they shouldnt have magazines that have bad stuff in public. Or adults shouldn't buy certain type of magazines because they never know what there child can expect to see.          So there is a lot of reasons why I think that people should remove certain book, movies, magazines, or anything that involves offensive stuff. All around the world you will see stuff that can offend you or anyone else just by seeing something on a movie, by listening to a song, or even my reading a book. It's just not a good idea of having stuff out there like that in certain places, like the library, stores, or anywhere else. Especially if there is people that take it really offensive when they see a title of a book that is bad or when they hear a song that has a lot of bad words. It's just wrong having stuff like that that can offend a lot of people. What if I read a book and it talks about my race or religion, would I take it offensive? People should ask themself that, before they read a book or see a movie. So they will decide whether or not they should have books, magazines, or music removed from the shelves."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4676	2	"OFFENSIVE BOOKS !!!   Did you ever think about why students read what they are ready now? They read books about sex , guns , and many more because they think its exciting well guess what its not! The author's who make them type of books want you to buy them because they want their money , but they never think about the kids. Kids would read anything now because of those kind of things.       I think that books like that should be removed because you dont want    your child to grow up reading those type of books then when they have kid  they wouldnt want the same. Many parents dont care what they chidren      read as long as they reading its fine with them , its not fine its very wrong and I wouldnt expect a great writer to use bad language also they think its okay to do that! Thats why kids act the way they do now is because of books , movies etc.      I think they should really stop making those books or have their own stores to where like adults can go buy those books or whatever books they want. I dont think kids would want to read those type of books anyway because they dont want to learn that stuff but some of them do and i dont think thats right at all. Thats why kids should read a very good book and dont judge a book by its cover !@NUM1"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4681	2	"I personally do not think that books or magazines and such with offensive things about them shouldn't be removed because they give people something to read. Most people don't want to read @CAPS1 or a novel. Some people want to read about crimes, mysterys, and action. There are alot of good movies out there but some of them I can agree with are too offensive to others. I gurantee that movies with comedy in them will be put down about what is being said. For example: @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to some people is very offensive. The only reason the person would think that the movie is offensive is because they are stubborn people that don't have a life.     I can believe that there are literature materials that are offensive to others, but the person that criticizes others doesn't think that they are offensive to the people that read the books that offened the person that is being offended. Books about war to some people are too graffic. But those books about war are probably books about history. I have only started noticing the people that are trying to get rid of those books that they don't like. But back in the @DATE1's people didn't care about what was in a library. They just want something to read. I say leave the librarys alone!"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4686	2	"What do you want your children to be able to see in their public library? As we all know, there are things like books, picture, and movies that we do not want our younger generation to see. This is @CAPS1 parents are so carful with computers, and what their children have access to.      Every situation has it's pros and cons, but in @CAPS2 cases if you analize the pros and cons you can come to an accurate conclusion. When you go to a library with your children, the children run off to do what they want, usually to the children's section. Let's face it, children do not want to look at adult book. Once children learn to read you might come across a bigger problem. As children get older they want to be able to do more things, like watching older movies, reading harder books, and look at want they want on the computer.      I'm sure that the first thing that might come to mind is to censor the library, take away the horror films, the banned books excetra. This might be fine at first, but what about the adults that have every right to read and watch whatever they want. The library is free, does this mean that if our society does not like a book, movie, or magazine taht the adults must go somewhere else to pay for a particular book or movie as apposed to borrowing if for free at the public library. It could work, but if a child is going to look at bad things at a library what will stop him/her from looking at them at a bookstore?           Another issue is banned books. @CAPS2 of them are classics that past generations have read in school. @CAPS1 would we decide to take these books away now? It makes it seem like the younger generations can not handle it, or that past generations have something to hide. The definition of a classic is a piece of writing that has stood the test of time. Does it just end here and now? @CAPS1 would we take the classics away? Let's face it, if the classics are not read in school today, and they are not read in the next generations what is stopping them from being forgetten? Some banned books parents will look at and say, '@CAPS1 would this be banned? I do not remember anything bad in it.' @CAPS2 of the time the classic banned books were written some time in the @DATE1, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 or the @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Society was different then. When you read a classic it acts as a history book to show us how it was to live during the time it was written. Usually the book will be banned because of bad language which people thing should be taken out of our schools, but they are missing the point. That was how things were back then so, who are we to hide it?      Does this mean that I think anything and everything should be put in our public libraries? Not at all. Some magazines can be avoided, or be put in a section away from younger children's eyes. Horror movies do not have to be taken out completly, just put in a different section. If parents are worried about monetering their children on the internet there is nothing stopping them from watching their children while they are using a computer.      I think that there can be come cesorship in libraries, but sometimes our society goes overboard. As long as we keep an open mind and make the right decisions for our future generations we can make our country a safe yet edjucational place to learn"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4695	2	"Have you ever went to the library and while looking for a book you come across a book about slavery with strong language or teenage years which included alcohol, drugs, and sexual content?  In the library, you can find books for leisure, study, training, and books found offensive to a variety of people.  People from children whose parents would be appalled by what their kids are reading about to adults find books offensive.  Although there is things in the library that are found offensive, I believe that books, movies, magazines, and music with offensive things in them should stay on the shelves because the internet is no different then the offensive things in a library, most people don't mind the vulgar and violence within the pages, and there are some fantastic books that some might find offensive.     People for centuries have been writing and coming up with songs, movies, and magazines.  What was accepted 'back then' is now considered inappropriate for viewers and readers.  There are many things in a library that, if not careful, could corrupt your children.  Children reading about violence, drugs, and other no no's are what teaches them wrong.  Parents and other people have been concerned about the censorship of libraries.  Hard enough as it is, parenting doesn't need the help of books, movies, and music to influence the bad onto children.  Children are the future and they need to be taught the right way.     An old librarian once told me that books need to be cherished throughout the years because they will eventually be replaced with technology and all the books, good or bad, will be gone.  It's hard to even imagine how technology is replacing various things in our lives and how it has changed from when it first started to be popular.  How does this pertain to offensive books?  Like almost everything out there, the internet could be used for good, or for harm.  Parents are concerned about their children reading books that are bad but let their child surf the internet which is hard telling how many inappropriate sites he/she might go to accidentally, or on purpose.  Books, music, and other offensive stuff in libraries are minor compared to the internet.  Protecting children from adult content filled libraries should be the least of a parents concerns.  Even if they are concerned about the minds of their children when they go inside a library, they can filter what a child looks at and reads about.  The internet is the real bad guy if anything is going to be blamed for corruption of minds.     Many people throughout the world have different tastes of what they like in a book.  A good plotline, good dialogue, interesting theme, drama, language, violence, drugs, alcohol, and sex are all ways people find reading books enjoyable.  Their own opinion on what is interesting is what helps them decide on books to read.  Reading books is a passion to some and enjoyable books is a must for them.  Without offensive books, people would find reading boring, and wouldn't be as popular as it has been.  I don't know about you, but I enjoy books that aren't boring.  Most offensive books are not boring and the action is what gets my attention and keeps me reading.     There are great books that for years people have enjoyed reading and continue to read today.  Even thought they are offensive, they provide good details that are required for a good book.  Tom @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are famous for writing ghory, violent, grusome books that would be qualified as offensive to others.  You have the choice not to read them or to read them.  Books that deal with slavery @MONTH1 also be found offensive like the book @CAPS1.  It does a supurb job at describing how things were during slave times.     Books, music, magazines and music should not be removed from the book shelves because they are essensial to everyday people and reading. They are required by some to enjoy a good book."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4710	2	"I think that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. People enjoy books with offensive language or content, people love to feel the engery or tone of the writer. I personal love offensive langauge if everything was censored it would feel like everything is dull and fake.     'Your @CAPS1****** cheating on me @CAPS2****', @CAPS3 you feel the wow in body. Now look if i censor it 'Your cheating on me @PERSON1' it felt dull and if you got cheated on before you probably thought of ten different thing you would have said differently and uncensored. If your a parent who don't want their child reading or seeing this you should try to teach or keep your child away from this.     Instead of removing why not just move them to an @NUM1+ section of the library. The @NUM1+ section will warn kids and parent what their getting into if their parent don't want them to be exposed to reality them then that means they should not be in that area.     libraries are usually divided into section but if not if you ask local libraries if they divide adult and children books into section of the libraries then they should tell you."	3	2		3	3	2	3																		
4714	2	"I think that some books in the library some people might take offensive. But some of those books have a meaning behind it.            I think theres one book out there that alot of people love to read, and that is @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The book uses the '@CAPS3' word alot and many people take that offensive, but why? There was a big arguement about alot of book companies changing the word in the book to @CAPS4 @CAPS5.             From my perspective I think it should stay the same. Why change that now? Many english teachers use that book because it talks about a white boy named @CAPS6 saving @PERSON1. Its not being used in a bad why at all just using the terms of how they did back in the olden days. The book is strong and shows readers a strong aspect in life.             Yes you shouldn't go around saying that word, but also not change it now, after its been out for along time to the public. The book would not bring the same meaning as it would if it is  being changed"	3	3		3	4	3	4

In the quote she mentions how if what every single person finds offensive is removed, eventually nothing is left.  The question of, 'Should library content be censored?' is a largely debated question.  There is a simple answer to this question.  It should not be censored.     Views on what should be censored and why, vary based on type of person and their background.  As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @PERSON2 made the observation that most people would not think far enough to realize.  The most logical thing is to not censor what works are put into libraries.  As was previously stated, once every person pulls what they deem should not be on shelves, the library will be but a building without books.     To keep children from getting into certain types of literature, movies, and music, libraries could have a section set off within the adult section for these works.  Many public libraries do not even have these types of items that would be so highly disputed for the simple fact that if the library does not even carry it, they do not have to worry about issues.  These public institutions are working for the best of the visitors, and if there are works needing to be kept from the childrens' section, there is no doubt that this would be taken care of appropriately.       The topic of censorship is a very touchy subject to start with.  This goes back to the debate of what exactly should be censored.  The problem with what is 'explicit,' is that there is no black and white line.  Does a book become inappropriate because a teen girl becomes pregnant within the pages?  In some eyes, the fact that a teenager got inpregnated within a book makes it inappropriate, but critics will argue that this is life and to shield the world from reality makes us all blind.  Proper instillation of morals and values on the homefront will help young citizens make intelligent choices, but expecting the world to censor itself for each individual is something that would never be possible.     Censorship in libraries is a touchy subject, but like Katherine Paterson said, if every person in the world removed what they thought inappropriate, there would be no books left.  This truth being stated, censorship in libraries should be stopped before every book is gone.  As the world turns, life cannot be stopped because bad or inappropriate things exist.  It can only be learned that yes, these things @MONTH1 exist, but by using better judgement the whole world can get along just fine without trying to remove everything 'bad.'"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4717	2	I think that no books should be taken away. I think that if a aduld or a child wants to look at something or read about something they should have the right to. If someone were to go to a public library that allowed people to listen to music and they cant because the song has curse words in it they should be allowed to. And if it bothers someone the bothered person can leave.          If someone wants to look at a magazine and they can't because it is inapropiate who cares. And if people wanted to check out a movie at a library and they cant because it's to violent so the library doesn't have it. I think librarys should be able to have whatever inventory they want. And if it's to violent or if the music is to dirty just don't let children get a hold of it.	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
4718	2	"If I found a book that I thought was innapropiate for others to read, I would ask the librarian to check into to see what she thinks about the book(s). If she believed they were offensive, then she could remove the book(s) without any questions being asked. If she was in the middle on a book and didn't know whether she should remove, she could take a vote or tally on that book and then go from there to see if it did needed removed. The only way I would find a book to be offensive is if it had pictures that were not appropiate for people to look at and it also depends on how old you are. Another offensive object would be too many words that involved foul language and or racism.      If i found a movie that was offensive, I would just ask that it would be moved to a place that only mature adults should watch or some teenagers. My opinion can't remove an object from its place unless there were multiple complaints about the book or movie and ect. Some movies and books should be removed from shelves because younger kids get a hold of these movies ans watch them and then go out into the real world and do these bad actions that was on the film. For example, if the movie/book was about drugs, then some kids would think it was alright for them to do because they  saw it on tv. Some kids even get killed because they go out and try these dumb ideas they got from the book and or movie. But the parents also play a role by letting their kid watch these, I think if they would watch what their children do, then some of this won't happen.      Music is another big thing that is becoming more and more out of control with offensive subjects. There is more foul language in music as it progresses. @NUM1 years ago, it wasn't that bad, but it's getting worse. I think some music should be banned because of the violence and sexual content it describes on the music. Some of the music I listen to, I just want to run it over with my vehicle because the whole song was about drugs, sexual content and or violence. I don't even know why an artist would want to write a song about bad content because they know younger people will hear it. I think offensive music has an effect on the violence that actually occurs in today's society because there might be some racism. I'm not trying to blame the artists or say it their fault, but I think they should think twice about their songs before they release it so everyone can listen to it.     Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but some things should not be on the shelves for our kids and children to listen to and or watch. I think there will be something done, but it will take time"	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
4722	2	"In our socioty, a lot of people and places take offense to certain things. In my opinion, librarys and book stores should not remove things from their shelves becuase they could be offensive.     People have the right to pick something up, over look it, and decide wheither it's offensive or not. If a book or movie that someone wrote or directed could get to them bad enough for them to freak out and complain to places that are selling it, then that book or movie probably shouldnt have been made.     I agree, somethings are offensive, but if someone you dont know wrote it or directed it, then dont let it bother you. I believe that music is a way that people express themselves. I honestly don't think that music should be censored when it's sold in any store. If the material is to graphic for children or some people, then don't listen to it. If you need things to be censored because of words or topics just so you can read, listen, or watch them, then maybe you just should do it."	2	2		2	3	3	3																		
4725	2	"Censorship in libraries is a big argument today. Many people wonder what is considered 'appropriate' for our children. With several @CAPS3 and @CAPS2 factors these days it is hard to find something that is not offensive to ones culture. Three main reasons we are not able to find a book reasonable, yet non-offensive for our children in libraries includes @CAPS1, @CAPS2 beliefs, and @CAPS3 beliefs.      @CAPS1 was a big deal in the late @NUM1's to early @DATE1's. Thanks to @LOCATION2, slavery became illegal in the @LOCATION1. Although, there are still many racist comments, articles, and films published today. If someone does not stop the harsh comments, then it @MONTH1 never stop. Even though it is not such a big deal today, that doesn't mean it won't continue to happen. Children do not need to see or hear racist comments made toward their race like many of their ancestors did.      Harsh put-downs and comments toward @CAPS2 beliefs are also inappropriate for the society, let alone for children to read. Books containing this are not considered appropriate for children and need to be placed in a different section of the library. As a teenage reader, my biggest belief and interest is learning about other cultures to see what it would be like to live in another country.      There are countless religions in the world today, many of which are accustomed by their own god(s). I belief it is of a great cause for children of the modern day world to celebrate their own religion how they would like. However, I believe it is not right to make hateful opinions toward other religions. This is also a thing that yet children have the ability to read about. Children should not be reading about fictious facts of religions and making the thought process in their head when they assume something is true about that religion when it is not. It is definitely a great idea to stick those materials in the @NUM2 section.      For now, children should be receiving material that they can easily comprehend and find interesting. It would be a great idea to make a fiction section appropriate for kids and then a @NUM2 section for kids and/or adults. An idea to take into consideration is that every local public library could have a meeting to decide whether to keep the library in easy-access form or not. That is for you to decide!"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4730	2	"Need help with Censorship in @ORGANIZATION1     (I chaged the @ORGANIZATION2 of this story that I heard from my grandparents because I could not remember the real one. This is not really happening at the @ORGANIZATION1 I think.)     To the people at the @ORGANIZATION3 I would like to tell you and your readers that there is something wrong with the @ORGANIZATION2. Nothing really all  to serious I guess. . It seems the libaraiains there are censoring  tons of books and other materials. One of which I really need for a homework assignment on the movie @CAPS1.      They say that they are censoring what I need for the assignment because it is to bloody and scary for some of the other readers.  There have also been some complates from parents as well, saying that their kids had nightmares for weeks from the movie .     To that I said well can I still use the computers there to get information. They said that they have  already blocked all the inaproperate sites as well. I do not have internet at home so you can see how well that is going to go at school. So then I tryed to get the @CAPS2 to uncensor all of the stuff they have all ready have censored. So that way I could just make them censor all the werid adult rated things at the @ORGANIZATION2. That way no kid will have nightmares any more.I also threw in the idea of seperarting all the @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 by age group like child,teen, older teen. To this they said all right but they were going to keep the classic @CAPS4 and @CAPS3     The @CAPS2 said they @MONTH1 try my idea and see if it works But I would have to volunteer at the @ORGANIZATION2 and go through all the stuff that has been censored over the years. To this I said ok, but after I saw home big the censor list was it was like a nightmare over a hundered pages of book at least. I was to scared to see how long the other lists were. So seeing that it was to big for me to handle alone I got most of the other volunteers to help me. Then put up posters at the school I go to,to see if anyone else would be willing to help me.      So far there has not been much progress in the lists so I would like to ask that if there are any readers out there reading this article. I could sure use your help because these are some really long lists. I @CAPS8 you all for reading this article, if you are not able to help then see if there is anyone else you know that would be willing too,@CAPS8 You."	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
4736	2	"books, music, movies, magazine, ect. shouldnt be taken off the shelves simply because they are offensive or because children can get their hands on them and repeat what they have read, seen, or herd. they should stay only because these so called 'offensive' objects that we have obtained can teach us very useful things such as what to do and what not to do and teaches us about our history or another countrys history. it is true there are some things in a library that children shouldnt see yet but whats to stop them from taking a look anyway? there are people who crave this offensive knowldge but are told time and time again they are not old or mature enough to handle such things but in more ways than one and it has been proven that some people thrive better with the true that holds violence than it being hidden from them. without these things children will never know what is really going on in the world around them and will be too shocked to do anything if they end up in the middle of something dangeroius and without the correct knowledg on how to handle it or where to go. that is exactly why the offensive things should stay in the library."	3	3		3	2	2	2																		
4742	2	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1     @CAPS2 my name is @PERSON1 and I am a student that attends @ORGANIZATION1. I go to libraries quit often, and things that I see in there I feel souldnt be in there. Like the movies. Theyre okay, but theyre all sitting together. So that means me bein a young lady. I see things that I know my mother wouldnt approve of me even looking at. They have censored movies just sitting there.     I even go through the shelfves sometimes and see the type of books that my mother wouldnt even look at. They have censored books in the libraries just sitting there like its a book about @CAPS3 or something. I have conversations with some of the workers sometimes, and they dont see anything wrong with little kids or teenagers looking at censored things. Not all of them think that way though. I dont think or feel that it should be censored books in the library and children aare able to look at them. Thats not right at all.     Far as the music i agree with music at libraries, because many people listen to different type of music. As long as the music is something positive, but there are all kinds. You just have to be careful what music you listen to at a library because there are young people everywhere. There are children around the age of @NUM1 in there, and younger too. They wouldnt know how to respond to a song thats talking about killing people or shooting them somewhere. Then you never know what there parents wanted them to know at a young age like that. I dont feel that real nasty and bad music should be played at @CAPS4 Libraries.         I dont believe censored magazines should be in there either. I really believe that magazines are one the main censored things in the library. There are many of them books also. They shouldnt be there at all just for the sake of the children and parents.They dont need to grow up fast they need to enjoy there life while they are young. And by looking at the censored things thats not helping at all.      Inconclusion, I really think something needs to be done about all of these censored things. Many people complain to the @CAPS1 when they come in the @CAPS4 Libraries. What im just askin you for is that you please help our @CAPS4 Libraries get those nasty things out of there. They can even make there own side of the Libraries with just censored things for adults only. I know that this is the right thing and i kno many people agree with me. People only want the best for their children and a library with alot of censored things in there doesnt sound like the best. That just mean they are startin off wrong.                                              Sincerly: A student who believes in changes"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4750	2	There should not be sensorship on the books in the library just think of how many great pieces of literature out there that no one would be able to get there hands because they didn't reach your standards. People wouldn't be able to reads some of their favor right books. Would you really want to take that from the people? If my arguement did' change your mind you copuld atleast put the sensored books behind the counter.	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
4752	2	"Censorship in libraries is when a librarian has the right to remove certain materials, such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., from the shelves of a library, if the item is inapropiate.  I believe that libraries should not have censorship.      I personally, think that it should be up to the library if they could have that power. If it is a library were there's always smaller children their, then I think they could have the power of censorship. In conclusion, it should be the parents of the smaller children's responsibility to make sure their child's book is appropiate for there son or daughter.     Now, say if it was just a normal library with both a mixture of both grown-ups and children, then I would say there still is no need at all for a censorship. First in for most, because its your choice of the item, if you think it is offensive then simply do not read it, watch it or listen to it.     Second of all, it wouldn't be fair to the people in the library who liked a certain item, but could no longer use that item just because one person thought it was offensive. Also people would just start saying they thought that item was not suited for the library just because they did not like it period.      Last of all, members of the library would have the same right as the librarians. So many of all the members have such different feelings on items, that so many different items would be taken off the shelf, that by the end there would be no books left.     In conclusion, personally I do not think censorship is necessary in libraries. It would not be needed because smaller children's parents should be responsible enough check the child's items, and also because there would be so much conflict with what items were taken of the shelf and how many items were taken off the shelf. There for, I believe cencorship is not need in libraries."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4769	2	"I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves due to censorship.Different sections in the libary should be offerd.Everyone has differnt oppions on what they like to read or watch.You should do what you want at your own risk.I think the censorship should not affect the libary.      The libary should offer differnt sections, therefore a kids side, a teenage side, and an adult side. The kids side should offer books that only kids should see by age group.The kids should not have to worry about censorship becuase they should not be offered any thing that an libarian would not want them to see and they should only be able to checkout things from their side of the libary.     A teen side should not have censorship because alot of kids know many things that they should not so it would not effect them as much.Books that teengers read are most likely to have foul language and inapropiate things. Teenagers when they read or see things does not really influenece them as much. Music that teenagers listen to they already know what most of the songs are talking about so why offer only censored music at libraries? Why would you want to try to remove something when it is already known?   An adult side should not have censorship, adults should be able to read, watch, and look at mostly anything.Adults are the ones who see it and heard it all. It would be pointless to get rid of things on the sheleves.. They already know of allot of things. Why get rid of books that others @MONTH1 read. It is a libary so it should just offer things that would increase intellegence not decrease it.     The censorship is pointless, you should do what you want at your own risk.Things in movies,books,magazines are that are of the world. Why try to block out negative things when there all around you. If someone finds something affensive then let it be there are many things affensive in today's society.You pick up what you want to read and make the choice on your own. If your capable of reading it or if it is the right decision check it out.You enter the libary at your own risk and choose what criteria or selection your going to choose.     The libary is full of differnt oppions and allot of differnt likes and dislikes.If you should not be looking at something then it is your oppion to take what you want out of it. Everyone enjoys differnt things like, movies,books, magazines, and music. If the libary had a censorship they would loose allot of matrials all due to oppions of people that did not care about others oppions.Everyone enjoys differnt things and wants a wide varitey of the things they like. The libary is where you go when you need  books, movies, and etc. Why close someones oppion of  book selections, what if that is the only type of selection, or book they like to read.     I believe that the censorship should not affect the libary.The libary should offer differnt sections  for certain age groups.The books and magazinges and music at the libary should all be at your own risk to checkout them. Everyone has differnt oppions at the libary. The censorship would be a bad decison if they did go through with this decison.. The libary would not offer as many things and most liekly less things would be getting checkedout. Therefore I do think that the cenosorship should not remove books on the shelves at libraries"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4772	2	"Libraries have a variety of material from books to movies.  Most of this is intended for a general audience and many people can read or watch whatever they want.  Some of the literature and other material you @MONTH1 find in libraries however, are not intended for certain people, such as young children.  Censorship takes material that these certian people should not read away from everyone.     Many people want censorship not just in libraries but in many aspects of life.  Censorship is not bad per say but it does restrict people, who would normally have access to a certain topic, to a general catigory.  Not everyone likes to read the same thing as someone else.  Other then likes and dislikes is the problem of offensiveness.  Everyone finds something offensive.  Just because you find something that speaks a bold statement does not mean that you should persicute someone who is intersested in the subject matter.  For the matter of protecting children against something they should not read yet is simple.  Libraries often have dedicated children's sections where children @MONTH1 choose material approprate for their age range.     More often then not I enjoy reading what I enjoy far more than something that is forced.  Censorship takes away from the enjoyment of reading.  By not having censorship, everyone will be happy in the fact that they get to read what they like.  This also allows a variety of books to a variety of people"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4776	2	"I do believe that  book, magazines, music, movies and etc., should be taken off a shelf if a person wants to read the book or magazine. If another person wants to read the book or magazine they would just have to wait until the book or magazine is returned to the shelf.  If another person wants to listen to music or watch a movie they should also do the same. Sometimes you just have to sit and think what is books, magazines, movies, music and etc., for and why are they on the shelves for if you can't read, listen or watch them. Book and magazine should be read and not just sit and be displayed. Music should be listen to and movies should be watched.     The reason why I agree with the fact magazines and book should be taking off the shelf  is  because they were made to enterain you. A book or magazine is also made to catch the reader attention. Another reason why I  think books or magazines should be removed from a shelf is to learn new thing. An example of learning new things is when you go to school you pick up the classrooom book you  learn different thing like math, you learn about the history, or you learn about different  thing in english class.  Magazines and books were made so that  different people can  take it off a shelf  and look though it even if they only want to look a pictures if it has picture.     The reason why I think music should be taking off the shelf is to listen to different music such as rap, @CAPS1&@CAPS2, gospel,or @CAPS1&@CAPS2 and soul. Also, I think music should be removed from the shelf is because it was meant to heard. Some music can teach you what goes on in a person life or what goes on in their heads.Music can inspire people in different ways.Music is apart of life and most people in the world like to listen it different people that inspir them.     The reason why I think movies should be taking off the shelf is because it is meant to be watched not just sit and let in movie cover entertain the people. Movies can also inspire different people to do different thing, such as become an actor also. Movies tell different stories such as life stories. Movies also give people something to do when they are bored.     To conclude this all up, take movies, magazines, books and music off the but put them back so that other people can enjoy they thing you read, watched, or listened to. Watching movies and listening to music nad reading magazines and books can help people in life and @MONTH1 also inspire people. They were made for very good reasons so don't put them up just to be displayed. Take them and use them for good you want regret it in the long run. Ya'll be suprised what different things you can learn by reading, listening and watching."	3	4		3	4	3	4																		
4777	2	"Different Then Everyone Else     @CAPS1 do people find small things offensive?My opinion is the everyone as their own idea of what can be offensive to them.There are so many small things the can be offensive like books, movies, and music.Its not horrible or bad to have a book on the shelf the you might think its offensive. I find it a little rude to discriminate someone for thier one belonging.      Books can be a way to learned new things about someone. I think sometimes books can tell you more then what can a person with there own words can.There are so many books the can be a little offensive to people and even kids.I know the a parent wouldn't like to have a book on the shelf  about '@CAPS2', when they are getting @CAPS2.Sure is not a nice thing to read about but, really parents think about it.Don't you think us like kids need to know what really means @CAPS2?A book can tell us the and a good way or and a bad way but we can learned from it,and you dont even have to talk about it.      Movies are similar like books,in one way the you can see it in action what there trying to teach everyone.I know the some movies are horrible just like @CAPS3 @CAPS4.Its a horrible movie to watch but really we need to know what really happened to does people. And even it a teacher is tell you have to see it with your own eyes to belive it. A good way it to watch the movie and learned from it.      Music has  a lot of ways of being offensive to people but singer's thats their way of express their own feeling about stuff.We can't really discriminate anyone for their own belives. There are so many singer like @CAPS5 @CAPS6, the use a lot of bad words in his song but thats how he get's his own feeling out to others. Even if the song is offensive to you its more of their own opinion just like we all have different opinon then others.      My opinion about feeling offensive is we all are different and have a opinion about it and we need to respect the. Especially if i wanted to learned new things and someone doesn't want to tell me or show me I would want a book or a movie to learned. And parents just becuase I'm reading a book, or watching a movie or listening to music  about bad stuff don't assume I'm  going to do those things I would just want to learned about it. I wouldn't like for someone to take a book off the shelf especially if i want to read it.

Also the mood is very thankful since Narciso admires everything that he's done in life and who he's helped out and he's thankful for all the friends he has and the care they have for him and his family and he thanks every oppertunity he gets in life. The mood also shows how that somthing small can turn out to be big on the inside because Narciso has done so much just from the small place he lives in."	2	2		2																					
11847	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful, joyful, and loving. The mood is grateful because the author's parents were such wonderful people, that made the author look up to them. The author even says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. The mood is also joyful because, although the author lived in just a simple house, inside, there was always music and he was influenced by his culture. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" After all a house is only a ""home"" if you feel welcome and love, and that is exactly how the author felt. Lastly, the mood is loving because in his home, his parents welcomed anyone who needed help. Example from the memoir is, ""My parents kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Over all, the author kept the mood lively and definitely happy, although the happiness went on through difficult times like segregation."	4	3		4																					
11848	5	"In the memoir, the author created a very upbeat mood. He clearly is very grateful for his family, and had a happy childhood. He pointed out the parts of his home and situation that could have been negitive for him while growing up, but then he cancelled those negitive things out by noting the positive aspects of each situation. For example, in the memoir he wrote about how his family had immigrated to the United States, and how they had good jobs in Cuba, but then had to start all over with low-paying jobs once they got here. He said that this was hard for them, but he found a positive way to look at the situation. He did this by writing about how his parent's situation taught them and him to always work hard, and never give up. So overall, he made what could have been a depressing story, have an upbeat and happy mode. He even made the story teach you a lesson about hard work and the importance of family and giving to others."	2	3		2

Also, how Cuban music was so passionate, adored so much, and how his parents turned a simple house into a home. therefore, this is the mood created by the author."	2	2		2

His parents turned their house into a home for other People as well. ""My parents always kept their Arms and door open to the many people we considered family."" Narciso's parents would take in anybody that needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet.

I say that the mood is soft because it has a nice thankful mood that's really telling everyone how grateful he is of his parents and their care. It's also saying that there was racism and segragation, so in that paragraph (which is the exception) the mood is more of a rougher mood, I say rougher as in ""a rough life,"" having to deal with racism and segragation. Back to the soft mood, @PERSON1 also mentions his friend and her putting meals on the table and having his family there regularly, this reminded me of when someone is going through a tough time and the camunity helps out by sometines cooking neals. This was nice of Alegria (@ORGANIZATION1's friend). And also, how they would house family until they were back on their feet and having the feeling that their familly would do the same. for them.

12026	5	"The mood created in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is a profound sense of closeness and selflessness that so enriched Narciso's childhood.

12037	5	"The mood in this memoir seems to be a grateful tone. The reason I say that is because Narciso says how grateful he was to have parents that left everything behind so that he could have a better life. He also sounded grateful when he talked about the Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people in his neighborhood would work together instead of being racist to each other. He also mentioned that he learned the meaning of ""family"" while living in that house. By ""family"" he didn't mean blood relative Family. What he means by family is everyone that would come into his apartment and everyone in the building was family too. The mood he has while writing the memoir is grateful."	3	3		3

The author describes his gratefulness towards his parents by remembering how they had to leave cuba, their native country, friends, family and jobs behind because they wished to give the child they wished for better life opportunities that could only be found in @LOCATION1. He thanks his parents repeatedly throughout the memoir for the love, caring, family, friends and selflessness they brought into his life. He describes situations where his parents had to make new friends and family from around their neighborhood and that from that a sense of love and friendship and unity was found. As his family got larger, the author talks about how his childhood, small, three-room apartment was made into a completed home. When all of these details combined, along with language such as.

""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"". This showed the mood because his family always took in people and made them feel welcomed @CAPS2 reason the mood was comforting and happy was that it talked about how all of the people were nice and kind to everyone they met. ""It was a close nit community of honest hardworking immigrants who extend a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were Clearly in need"".

12062	5	"The mood I felt when I read the @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez was a feeling of togetherness. I got this mood because he is always talking about being together with his family and how the home he was brought up in truly brought everyone in his family together and this made him proud of his family and his Cuban Culture. His family meant a lot to him so another mood could be love because of his love for his family and the house he grew up in where he learned to love. His parents did a lot for him and, ""Turned their simple house into a home"". He learned everything he could ever think about from his parents and he loves them a lot.

12070	5	"The mood described by the author in the memoir is a greatful and happy feeling I say this because the main character, Narciso Rodriguez, Always brings up how he is greatful for his partents helping him in his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also, the mood is a happy mood. I think this because the story states, ""At tine when overt racism was the norm... All of the cultures came together in great soidarity and friendship."" Even though there is racism, @CAPS1 one is friends."	2	2		2																					
12079	5	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a truely original mood in the excerpt. I would say he puts a kind of grateful mood in the excerpt. He is consteintly stating how grateful he is toward his parents for their selflessness, and courage. One example of Narciso creating a grateful mood is when he says: ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing and I could have ever done."" This quote shows how much gratitude Narciso actually has for his parents. Another example where Narciso shows tremendous gratitude is when he says: ""they came, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" In this quotation, Rodriguez shows that he knows what it took to come here, he knows the loses that his parents went through, and for that he is truely grateful."	3	2		3																					
12080	5	"I believe that the mood created by the author is happy and loving. In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Growing up in the enviorment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 not only the people blood related to your is your family but also friends and anyone close to you. The excerpt also states ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcome other refugees to celebrate their arival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" This shows the love that everyone has for one another. Lastly the excerpt states ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of family."" This part makes you feel warm and happy about family."	3	4		4																					
12090	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, Narciso Rodriguez talks about what he thinks the definition of ""family"" is. He is very specific in that he believes ""family"" doesn't mean blood relatives, ""family"" is about friends and family coming together to form a community. Where everyone helps everyone and everyone is treated fairly and with respect. He sets a very specific mood in this memoir which is everyone coming together. That sense of happiness and fullness one might get after doing something good for someone else. Narciso Rodriguez talks about how his dinner table is alway full of family and sometimes friends. That his family's door is always open to people who need help. When you read his memoir, you really understand what ""family"" really is. The feeling of love, open-ness, willingness, and happiness. you get helping other people and being around people you love and who love you. The mood Narciso Rodriguez sets in this memoir is very powerful in that it really makes people stop and think."	3	4		4																					
12093	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is love. I think the mood is love because he talks about the love and support his whole family had. One example is when he says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" To me that is saying how his parents loved him so much (even though he was not born yet) that they sacrificed everything they had for their children. That is why I think the mood is love."	2	2		2																					
12096	5	The mood of the story is some what sad and some what happy. It's sad because he comes from a not welthy family and were immergrants. but happy because he finaly knows the meaning of family and these are the moods of the story.	1	1		1

12146	5	"The mood created by the author is touching. I think that the mood is touching because Narciso Rodriguez is talking about how his neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, & Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm & segregation prevailed in the United States. Also b/c he had to share a house with alot of people, his parents struggled both personally and financially & his parents couldn't find a jobs. That's why I think the mood is touching."	1	2		2																					
12151	5	"The mood in this memoir can be described as anything happy. The author sets a real nostalgic feel about happy memories in the memoir. One of the memories is the kitchen. Rodriguez describes the room as a very peaceful place with music and traditional Cuban food. He says he remembers them and still loves them to this day. He also recalls his freinds and naybors that he used to have over. Even during a time of @CAPS1.S.A racism, the freinds still found ways to make them all happy and all got a long. Another fond memory he re-calls is his parents teaching him life lessons. He says that his parents were scientists back in cuba but moved to @LOCATION1 in order to have a better home. This taught him a lesson that family can matter more then money. Through these fond memories, Rodriguez says that he finds the true deffinition of family."	3	3		3																					
12154	5	"The author of the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a caring, happy, and thoughtful mood. By mentioning the Cuban traditions shared in the neighborhood between close friends, and cooking in the kitchen to share a great meal with one another the mood is happy. When Narciso talks about the great friends he made from different heritages and knowing the entire community like family the mood is thoughtful and caring because it shows that the people really appreciated each other's company. It is also caring in the story when Narciso talks about how his parents devoted their lives to making sure that their children and the people they knew had good lives to. When Narciso describes the way his parents struggled during the cold winters, yet they always let others in, shows a very caring mood in the memoir. I also think that the fact that a small, simple apartment they lived in is very important to Narciso because he repeats it several times. I think he does this to show a thoughtful for mood, in that the house was small but through creativity in bringing culture in made it seem much bigger."	3	4		4

For example, the author tells us about racism and how it was normal in the United States but the community overcame it: ""a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.

Rodriguez shares a unique happy feeling with this excerpt; the feeling of great memories that have been strengthened with each day. The phrases he uses to help describe the house like "passionate Cuban music filled the air" and "the congregation of family" established this vibrant and happy feeling of the welcoming household he grew up in. The excerpt furthers these feelings when the author tells about how much his parents gave when they themselves had little of their own. The description of these selfless attitudes and ways helps paint a beautiful portrait of a family, with "extended family" also, forgetting their troubles and enjoying every second they spend together in a lively kitchen. As the author goes on to tell how grateful he is for his parents and wonderful, warm childhood, it provides a serene and a down-to-earth honesty from the author. The excerpt recreates a feel good time of a carefree life and worryless days that provide a wonderful atmosphere for the reader."	3	3		3

""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed bot, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This quote shows how cozy or ""warm"" their home is. In the memoir he also explains how welcome people are and that everyone in the Apartment building was friends or even family! ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me the great sence that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote means that in his welcomeing home friends were also concidered his family. Narciso Rodriguez had a wonderful @CAPS2 to grow up in."	2	3		3																					
12237	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a verry happy tone.

Narciso Rodriguez's parents showed so much love and support towards him. Paragraph five says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This quote shows that even before Narciso was born his parents were thinking about them. Narciso's parents wanted their child to have a good life. A final mood would be happiness. Narciso is very happy and has alot of gratitude for his parents. Narciso quotes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.

12243	5	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso @CAPS1"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives the author creates a very powerful and posative mood. One strong example of this is how he expresses his parents. He implies the mood they set on him by saying things like ""always be greatful for my parents"",  ""admiration for their strength"", ""perseverance"", and ""generosity."" The mood Narciso used to express his family was very positive and thankful. Another example of the mood the author sets is what he thinks of his culture. He tells that his family and friends are immigrants and how hard they worked to be free and give a better life to their families and children. The struggle and hard work his family went through to keep their culture alive; Narciso was very thankful for. He was extremely proud of his culture and thankful for the example his family had set.

12247	5	"As I read the article, also called memoir, I didn't so much find a certain mood that the author had created. This memoir is indeed heart warming and touching, though it is very inspirational. It teaches, at least it taught me, that if you can dream something then you can do it. Narciso's parents most likely did dream of coming to america to raise a family and they accomplished with a little hope and hard work. If I had to say what mood this author created I would say happiness. The reason for that is because Narciso was not rich in the sense of money but rich in the sense of love, happiness, and family cultures. For example, as this article said, his parents had a talent for cooking which was passed down to Narciso and he was grateful. Another example is that he was filled with joy and happiness just because of who is family and neighbors were and how he spent his life living around them."	3	3		3

Also throughout the whole memoir you can feel the happiness when he talks about eating dinner with all his family members and friends. One more detail about the mood is that he sounds very grateful for what his parents did and the hard choice they had to make about moving to @LOCATION1. There are some details of why I think the mood of this memoir is happiness	2	2		2																					
12267	5	"The mood the author used in the memoir is showing how proud their family is.

You are with your family but they are not your blood family. They are having so much fun with people you just met because they are so excited that they made it to @LOCATION1 and they are just having fun with their culture and tradition. The whole neighborhood is one big family they all call the older people who are living in their basement their grandparents when their real grandparents are in Cuba.

The author is gratefull for all of the skills that her parents taught her like cooking, which she said that she was grateful for and also music. She loves to cook and listen to cuban music. She also loves all of the people around her home and how they all came together in unison even though they were all different cultures. She is grateful for all that her parents sacrificed to give her a better life. That is what I think was the mood of the memoir created by the author is."	2	2		2																					
12393	5	"Based on the memoir the mood created by the author in the memoir was filled with lots of love and satisfaction. It was filled with love and satisfaction because Narciso and family loves everyone for who they are. People from all over came and be apart of the family and it was alright with them. It said in paragraph @NUM1 that growing up in there environment instilled in them a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In there neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. They were all proud and happy with everyone coming together as a family. In paragraph @NUM2 Narciso said that he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. Narciso had a loving mood because he is grateful for what his parents done for him. Last but not least in paragraph @NUM3 Narciso also had a mood of love and thankfulness because he learned the real definition of family and love. Narciso proclaimed, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	4	4		4																					
12396	5	The mood created by the auther sounds like he's happy But sad at the same time. He is happy to move to america. But sad cause his friends aren't gunna be there with him. Another thing is he sounds sad cause he is thinking About memories. Those are things dat describe the mood that the author created.	1	2		2																					
12407	5	"The author definatly created a mood when he wrote the memoir. The mood is love. All throughout the memoir, he talked about how his parents love of him had them leave their countries and come to the US. Because they loved him and wanted him to have a good life they left Cuba, everyone they knew and loved, the jobs they had, and started all over. Their families love turned the house into the home he loves. They brought the culture of Cuba into their new home with decorations and ""the very heart of which was the kitchen. The memoir's mood is the love of the author's parents to him."	2	2		2																					
12410	5	"The mood about the @CAPS1's memoir is his happiness and caring and the selflessness. According to the text in @CAPS2 @NUM1, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. That's how the mood describes the @CAPS1 memoir of Narciso Rodriguez background and his family."	1	1		1																					
12413	5	"I think the mood in the memoir is love. I think this because the whole memoir is about family, friendships, and relationships. For example in paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""countless extended family members came and went- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily, until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" In this quote I believe it is saying that everyone you know and love is part of your family and that you should always be available to help, just as they will too. The mood of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is love and that you should always be their for your family and your family will always be there for you."	2	2		2																					
12418	5	"There is a very distinct mood set by Narciso in this passage. He talks about Faith, love, courage, and just the overall niceness of his home and community. He speaks of the ""innocence of childhood"" and the ""gratitude for the spirit of generosity"" impressed upon him at a young age. I believe the mood is one of gratitude, gratitude of how his parents struggled to raise him right and well. He is grateful for his home, his family, and his community, of course he ""groups"" the last two together because of the deep, emotional way they all felt. Gratitude is one thing so he doesn't have."	2	2		2																					
12422	5	"The author's mood was a very grateful and good mood throughout the memoir. The author loved everything about these memory's. For example, ""and a love of cooking that is still with me today (for which I am eternally gratefu)"". The author shows that he is in a good mood by saying he is eternally grateful. His mood was also very appreciative. For example, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind families..."". The author is very thankful and appreciative to his parents that came to the United States from Cuba just for him. He has thanked them many times. The author also shows his gratefulness again at the end of the passage. For example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". The authors parents bought a house that was big enough for his family and his mood was grateful due to his parents. Lastly, the authors mood was very thankful. For example, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". The author shows that he learns family and is very thankful to his parents for that. That's how the authors mood was."	3	4		4																					
12428	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is being together. This mood is created by saying how his parents created a traditional cuban home in New Jersey. Also, when he said that that his parents always kept open arms and door. I think that ment that they were willing to let people stay with them and help them out when they were having a hard time. Also, when he said that everyone in the neighborhood despite there customs came together in friendship."	2	2		2

12436	5	"The mood of this story is happy, hopful, and caring. In some paragraphs, the mood shifted and felt upsetting and gloomy (p @NUM1) ""They struggled both personally and financially."" At these parts in the memoir it felt sad and hopless to see what struggles they faced. But then it shifted. Narciso used words like, ""courage, selflessly, love, family, and celebration."" This transformed this memoir to an exciting and happy story. They never gave up hope and all the imagrents helped eachother with their problems. This is set a mood of selflessness, and caring which is what the Rodriguez family brought to the United States."	2	2		2																					
12442	5	"The mood created by @PERSON1 in the memoir from ""Home:The Blueprints of Our Lives"" is that of a grateful sense.

In this quote is saying straigh up how he feels, which is grateful. You can also tell that he is implying that he loves his parents. Another quote that supports my main idea is The author says, ""... There is no way to express my gratitude..."" In this quote, just like the last one the author is saying directly how he feels, which is again greatful. In conlcusion the author uses effective techniques to trap the reader in his mood, which is greatful and @CAPS1."	3	2		3																					
12448	5	"Narciso Rodriguez @CAPS1 the following definition of family in this memoir. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity & friendship.

In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice. They showed me with their own lives & these teachings have been the basis of my life. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent & music but life & love. It was here where i learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love.

He feels as @CAPS1 those times, are never going to be forgettable, that he's always going to remember those times. That once he gets older, he will take these good times, as granted. Even during bad times, he will look back. Also he will always be thankful, for what his parents have done, to make his life better, and esier. That way he wouldn't have to life a hard depressed life.

I can tell he is very proud of his parents because they gave up everything to come to @LOCATION1 so their children could have better lives. The author reffered to them as selfless, and I would agree. The mood of the entire memoir is mostly shown in the last two sentences where the author says, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.

My reason for thinking this is that the story talks about how the parents sacrificed everything to move to the @LOCATION1 so they would have a better life and so would their children. Another reason why love is the mood is because he talks about how even though the people he spent his time with weren't his blood relatives, he still consider them all family.

The memories he shared with his family during that time makes the mood for loving. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" His parents shared their love and compassion with everyone else, and that is what Narciso is grateful for; for the love and sacrifices his parents made for him.

Instead of just telling us that there was passionate Cuban music in his home as a child, he included the parenthasese to remind us that he still loves the music he used to listen to. This makes him sound very thankful that his parents played that music in his home. In addition to him giving us reasons to believe he is thankful, he tells us in his memoir that he constantly thanks his parents. ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). He tells us plainly that he thanks his parents, and that he is very thankful for what they did for him when he was a child.

But joy is not the only mood in the memoir, because though the memoir is mostly about positive things, the reader still has to remember that this is a memoir. Meaning this was only written because Narciso Rodriguez passed away. Therefor sadness is also a mood in this memoir. In the end, the joyfull mood sort of covers the depressing one, but to really get a sense of where the writer is coming from the reader most consider both these moods."	3	1		1

Overall he thanked his parents and said ""in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age, and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."	2	3		3																					
12611	5	"The authors mood in the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, could be discribed as calm, and a little sad. The author is constantly talking about, and remembering, what her home was like when she was growing up. But, now she is moving away from her beloved home and it makes her sad. Also, she talks about how ""My parents always Kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" This would also make her seem sad because maybe her parents died and that's what she remembers about them. As you can see, the authors tone in this memoir is calm, and sad."	2	1		2																					
12615	5	"The mood that is created by the author is joy. The reason I think that is because Narciso's parent's are immigrants who works hard. They could've stayed in their own country but they wanted a better future for Narciso. When Narciso realized that he felt happy and filled with joy. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents."" When you're grateful you feel happyness. This is the mood that I think this author created."	2	2		2																					
12619	5	"One of the moods in the memoir was greatful. Narciso greatful to have parents who gave up so much to make a good life for him. Also he is greatful because his parents showed him how important family and friends are. This means that he was greatful to have parents who cared enough to give up things they loved for people they loved. Another mood is peaceful because Narciso loved the Cuban music they listen to. Narciso had people over all the time, the kitchen was always being used. He says ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. I mean his house was a peaceful and a safe place. Everyone was always at his house. His parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people the considered family."" the last mood I thought was happy. Narciso was always happy because his family helped so many people. Also he loved that his parents thought them so many things. I mean that he always had something to do. He was always happy to be around family and friends."	4	3		4																					
12633	5	"Narciso Rodriguez is very gracious and compassionate, and he will never forget the monumentous risk his parents made to leave everything behind to come to @LOCATION1 so he could have a better life. Narciso recalls how his parents had to take any job they could and ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This past @DATE1 I was in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 and I had to stay with this family. This family was great to me, and I will never forget their uncany attitudes to give me whatever I want. When I read this passage this family immediatly popped into my mind. Narciso's mood is unbelievably grateful to levels most people don't have the chance to experience. Narciso will never forget his parents and the sacrifice they made for him."	2	3		3																					
12638	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is joyfull and grateful. The author is joyfull because in stanza two Narciso states ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that the childhood of this person was joyful with the culture, family, friends, foods, and smells. This person is very grateful for all of the things he parents did. Such as when the author states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could've ever done. I thank them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for this period of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This shows that the author is truly grateful for everything the parents had done for him or her and he or she is really joyful now thinking back and makes the mood of the memoir joyful and grateful."	3	3		3																					
12656	5	"In the memoir the mood created by the author is gratefullness. I know this because in the memoir it says, ""But, in reality, theres is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This evidence shows how Narciso Rodriguez was grateful which is the mood of the memoir. His parents taught him how to love his culture, (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" The way the author puts the words and uses them shows the mood of the memoir is grateful."	2	3		3																					
12659	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is a clothing designer who grew up in @LOCATION1 with all different immagrets. The mood of it is that home isn't a physical space but relationships. ""Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" (@NUM1). He had a: ""Close-Knit community of honest, hard working immigrants.."" (@NUM1). I think Narciso would be a clothing designer if he didnt grow up with these people."	2	2		2																					
12664	5	"The mood in this memoir is very happy. It kind of shows how lucky we are, by showing how greatful they are to be hear in @LOCATION1. The mood is also joyful."	1	1		1																					
12670	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" The author was very happy and grateful. I know he is happy in this memoir because in paragraph @NUM1 he writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" This is a happy setting where the author grew up in. The author was also very grateful to his parents. I know this because in paragraph @NUM2 he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. This shows the emotions the author felt growing up."	2	2		2																					
12674	5	"The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is hopeful, heart lifting, caring, grateful, lively, loving, and courageous. It's hopeful because Narciso's parents had to start their lives all over with any jobs they could find and they wouldn't have made it without hope. They had hope in their children when they came to @LOCATION1 to have great and prosperous lives. It's also heart lifting because it was about how their parents came to @LOCATION1 for their kids and they ended up successful in life and became someone. Having people for dinner, housing others in need, and always ready for more to come who fell down in their lives and need some comfort shows as much care as a parent is to their newborn. Narciso's parents showed him what family, and friends are and to have courage and persevere. He is very grateful of his parents for these important lessons of life: They didn't just tell him, they showed him through their lives which makes it much more effective. They always had life in their home because of the music and aromas in the air and all of the people that came for dinner or to stay for a short time. His parents must have had courage to throw away their life's work, come to @LOCATION1 for better lives for their children, and to start a new career. The mood was very important to really feel the message of the memoir."	4	3		4																					
12676	5	"I think the mood of the passage @ORGANIZATION1 by The Blueprints of our Lives is a very @CAPS1 mood because in the passage it @CAPS6 ""I've thanked them repeatedly"" I believe this meas that @CAPS2 is thank full that her parents provided him/her with a good home. Another reason I think that the mood of the @CAPS3 is @CAPS1 because in the story the @CAPS3 @CAPS6 ""I will never forget new my parents turned his Simple house into a home I think this means that the @CAPS3 is @CAPS8 and that is the mood I believe the article is about."	1	2		2																					
12692	5	"The mood of this memoir is grateful and content. The author @CAPS2 this mood with his quotes that @CAPS1 puts in. ""I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" That @CAPS2 that the author did not care that much about house looks, price or its location. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of family... [that it] had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 is grateful for all the people that @CAPS1 now considers his ""family"". Also, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"". That @CAPS2 right in the quote that @CAPS1 is feeling grateful! The author also puts some phrases in parentheses, just to add a bit more, ""(after which I eternally grateful)"", ""(which I adore to this day)"". Those show @CAPS1 is happy and grateful with his life, and last this next quote @CAPS2 that his ""family"" members were all grateful for each other. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necissarily their own kind, were clearly in need""."	3	3		3																					
12696	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir. The mood was a good feeling. To explaination of how he lived @NUM1 reality. Having family come live with you till they get back on their feet. Having family all around you. Realizing you turned your ""house into a Home"". Endless celebrations that encompassed, both form a a backdrop to life in their warm home. ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in their country they loved."" ""The barriers to work were strong and high and my parents both accepted that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they had deserved."" ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr.. Had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied Chemical Engineering."" In @LOCATION3, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" Is what I thought the author in the memoir mood was."	3	2		3																					
12698	5	"The mood is a mixture of things, it's really hard to say withe all the emotions the author throws around. But however the strongest feeling is unity, and family.I'm Not sure family can be called an emotion, but it is I think something that can be described by several. One of course is unity, or as he says it, ""great solidarity and friendship""it's rather sweet how he charectorizes family as something as the bonds you make withe people in contrast to other cultures where family is from blood ties and family s always first. So in a way I think his way of thinking comes from his culture.But also he puts in a bit of sadness but overall seems to be extremely thankful for what he has. As they say ""happiness is nothing without appreciating it"" and as he says ""I learned the real defnetion of family"" so apparently he knows real happiness"	3	2		3																					
12705	5	"I think the mood created by the author was gratefulness towards his parents. Narciso Rodriguez wants to tell his parents how very special they are to him and how much he thanks them for what they did for him. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez says that ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" I think that in this memoir, Narciso wants the reader to understand how he feels about his family. He wants to tell us about what they did for him. Narciso thanks his parents for their sacrifice and I think by telling us his story, the mood that was created was gratefulness towards the parents who made him a 'home.'"	2	2		2																					
12706	5	"In this excerpt from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, @PERSON1  talks about the true meaning of ""family"" and the mood of gratitude is established.""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills... Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" In this passage, @PERSON2 is establishing his gratitude for the cultures of his family. He is grateful for the food and music that has wound its way into his present day life.My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" This quote explains how much @PERSON1's parents sacrificed for his happiness. They left behind everything and everyone they loved, basically a huge chunk of them, and for that, he is extremely grateful."	4	4		4																					
12709	5	"The mood in the memoir is grateful. It is grateful in a few ways. One way is in paragraph six he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because they moved to the @CAPS1 from Cuba. Another way is in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""my parents both shared cooking duties an unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I admired to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because of their Cuban culture and specifically their cooking skills being passed on to him. Those are some reasons why the mood of the memoir is grateful."	3	3		3																					
12710	5	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful. Narciso is thankful for his parents support and love. When he talks about how he feels about his parents, he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM1). The words ""grateful for their love and sacrifice"" demonstrates that through his whole life they were there for him. They didnt just tell her what to do, they showed her. When he talks about the @NUM2 lessons he has learned from his parents, he says ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life"" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM1). The words ""basis of my life"" demonstrates that they taught him how to live (the essentials to living).  They also showed him the meaning of family. He doesn't just think family is blood related, ""It was here when I learned the real definition of ""family"""" (Rodriguez, p. @NUM4). The words ""definition of family"" demonstrates that he is thankful for them teaching him what family means to them. In conclusion, the mood of this passage is grateful. "	4	4		4

12741	5	"In the story I just read, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I think that the mood that the author gives would be passionate, greatful, and happy.The reason why I think the author is passionate because he talks about how a home isn't just a roof over your head, its where your heart is. ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open for the many people they concider family."" I think that is passionate because in order to do those things you have to be really caring and lovable.I think that the author shows greatfulness because he says that he always thanks his parents for the sacrifices to give him a better life in @LOCATION1. Even though he says it many times, it just isnt good enough to prove how gratful he is. His parents changed a three bedroom apartment into a place he now calls home and that is what he is greatful for.I think that Narciso is happy that he had gotten a chance to spend his child hood lif growing up in @LOCATION1, but still take on the cultural tredition of Cuba. He is now a fashion designer.All in all that are all the three moods that I think Narciso gives in the story."	4	3		4

Narciso is very happy and lucky to be born in the United States and have a chance to grow up there. Second Narciso loves his home. He talks about how they created their New Jersey home into a traditional Cuban home. For example he says that the kitchen is the heart of his home and how his parents taught him how to cook, which he is greatful for. Lastly his mood towards his friends is that he treats them and considers them as his family. For example his landlord's daughter cooked meals for him more often than not. Also his ""real"" grandparents wich weren't his real grandparents because they were still in cuba. Those are the reasons that create the authors mood in the memoir."	3	3		3

They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind thier families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.""  this shows how grateful he is for his parents, to do all this, just to give him a better life.

In the last @CAPS4 Narciso explains that this is the home where all her first birthdays happened, and where her friends and family would gather. The message the @CAPS1 was trying to get across is that it doesn't matter how big or expensive a home is, it matters who is in the home that makes it a special place to be.

12866	5	"I think the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is that he is proud and grateful. One way he shows he is grateful is by telling the readers how his parents sacrificed themselves to give him a better life. He says: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Which shows that in addition to being grateful to them for sacrificing themselves, he is grateful for all the love and care they gave to him as he grew up. Narciso Rodriguez shows he is proud by saying ""my Mother and father had come to this country with such courage… I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done"". This shows Narciso Rodriguez is proud to have parents that are strong and brave and willing to leave ""behind their families, friends, and careers, and the country they loved"" all for him. So I hope you now see how Narciso Rodriguez's memoir creates a mood that reflects how he is proud of and grateful to his parents."	4	2		3

The reason why I said that is because everytime he spoke about being Cuban or about his family, he spoke with this joy or pride in his voice. Also when he was talking about Spanish, Italian and Cuban all like being a family. Another mood he had was kind of sad. The reason why I say that is because when he was talking about how he couldn't his a real grandparents until 1970. He sounded a little deppressed about that.

13133	5	"The mood created by the author in this... memoir would be thankfulness and appreciation. I think @PERSON1, wrote this memoir for his parents. He wanted to portrey that even though most people would think that he had a tough life, he would completely disagree.

13138	5	"In the memoir, the mood that is created by author is a loving and grateful mood towards the author's parents. A example from the memoir is when the author talks about his gratefulness toward his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM1).

He talks of the music and smells of his house, giving the feel that one is actually there sensing everything. He describes his home in such a relaxed way, and how the people in his neighborhood were also good to eachother. It gives the empression that his life was like a relaxed dream where everything is right. He talks of all his relatives that live nearby, and being a child I feel a somewhat comforted sensation from that very part. He describes how his parents had been working in Cuba with great jobs, but had moved for their children to @LOCATION1 where they would have to take lesser paying work. Sacrifices like those make me feel as if there is pure love left in the world, I only wish my parents cared like that. Though this story proves the love of two parents to their children, and that alone makes me feel a sense of peaceful closure."	2	3		3																					
13147	5	"Memoirs have a certain mood that the author usually works around with. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the author explains his family in a very @CAPS1 way.

13494	5	There were several different moods created by the author some were @CAPS1 peacful. Like he was talking about his first @CAPS2 warmth of the kitchen cuban the feast.

13498	5	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created by the author is grateful. The narrarator in this memoir is very grateful as it states in paragraph @NUM1. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. He also says that they have done a more courageous thing than he could ever do. The narrarator is also very proud of being Cuban. Also, he loves Cuban music. He also states that he loves his house in paragraph @NUM2.

13504	5	"The author creates a sense of unity and happiness when she explaining how she had grown in her home, her neighborhood, and with her parents. Narciso first begins to tell us about where she grew up and how she was brought. She says that she was born in a simple house in Newark, New Jersey. She also says that she had lived in a traditional Cuban home and how she is thankful for her Cuban roots. Then Narciso continues by telling us about how there was a great sense of unity and ""family"" growing where she did. She says she grew in a neighborhood where everyone was one big family. Towards the end Narciso tells us how much she is greatful for her parents and their love & sacrifice. Throughout the whole memoir, Narciso's main focus is how she grew, her Cuban roots, her gratefulness for her her parents, and last of all her own definition of a real ""family""."	3	3		3																					
13505	5	"I think the mood the author created in the memoir is love. Through the memoir, he talks about his parents immigrating, his new home, and people that were always at his house. This shows their love, and his parents' selflessness. He portrayed his parents as caring people and it seems like they showed love to everyone. Rodriguez says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" They seemed to put other people before themselves, and to always surround themselves with people who they love, and to love them."	2	3		3

The sacrifice and love of anyones parents (like Rodriguez's) is what you should be most thankful for.	2	1		2

13516	5	"In the memoir from ""Home: The blueprints of our lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of this seems to be overjoyed, and happy. His life so far in @LOCATION1 must be great. For example, Narciso talked about how his sense of ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Also, about passionate cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. As well as the love and sacrifice of his parents that was given to give him a better life. But most of all the mood gets serious at times, like when he talked about how his parents turned the simple house he lived in into a home. Then, how it was in @LOCATION1 he learned the real definition of the word ""family"", and how to love, etc. In conclusion, the memoir jumped from overjoyed and happy into very serious and real."	3	3		3																					
13523	5	"In the memoir, the mood, or how the article made me feel, was grateful.Narciso Rodriguez wrote this memoir almost as a thank you letter.""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. -paragraph @NUM1 uses words that portait the mood of thankfullness, like ""eternaly grateful"" in paragraph @NUM2, or ""I will always be gratefull"" in paragraph @NUM3.Narciso Rodriguez describes all of the sacrifices that were made and all the hardships lived through by his parents.

13530	5	"The mood portrayed in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is closeness. The first way in which the extreme closeness of Narciso's childhood is displayed in the memoir is through the way that, ""all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"" when, during the time period that this story is taking place in, the many different immigrants would never usualy even think of mingaling with each other. This shows that, in Narciso's youth nobody cared about race and every person in his neighbor hood was extremely close to the friendly people who surrounded them, regardless of ethnicity. The second form in which the tight bond between his literal family and his many neighbors is describing all of his aquaintances as ""family"" that have a close enough bond to each other to be able to show up at each others doors and immediatly be taken in and fed a meal that the Rodriguez family worked hard to procure. This insight into the early years of Narciso's life shows that he grew up with the understanding that ""...' family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" and that you should treat all of your friends as you would family. Finaly, and possibly the most extreme way that the @CAPS1 shoed their extrordinary closeness to their friends and relatives is by keeping their, ""... arms and their door open to the many people we considered a family..."" This willingness to give anyone they knew a place to stay and food to eat shows how extremly close they were to everyone the knew. Wether it be by always having their door open, to mixing between many races, or considering almost everyone family the Rodriguez family showed extreme closeness with the rest of human kind."	4	4		4

Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us. and Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not.""@CAPS1, the mood is described as warm and family-like. In paragraph four, he states, ""Countless extended family members came and went..."" And in paragraph seven, it says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood...""@CAPS2, it's a loving mood. In paragraph four, it states, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" And in paragraph six, he says, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and preseverance, and I've thank them repeatedly.""To conclude, the mood created by the author is described in many ways."	4	3		4

For example, in paragraph @NUM1 Narciso states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice."" Narciso's parents left everything they ever had behind, to make his life easier. This whole excerpt is thanking them. Also, in paragraph @NUM2 Narciso ends with ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows how much he loves them. He could've had a big house where his family lived, but it wouldn't be home. Instead, he had a small house where everybody shared things. He could really call it home.In the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez the author sets the tone of gretfulness & loving. I can relate to this story because it reminds me of my family."	2	3		3

13568	5	The mood that the author created in the memior is love and friendship. In the memoir they talk about family and how the love each other. Another mood mood that the author creates is happiness. The memior is uplifting and cheerful. Those are two of the moods the author rreates.	2	1		2																					
13569	5	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is peaceful because the whole memoir is talking about love and care for each other and your family.In this memoir there are many times where the author discusses his love for cooking. ""It was the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent in music but life in love"". This quote shows that Cuban feasts caused him to experience life and love with his family and loved ones. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of family"". This proves that his life in New Jersey at his house helped him realize the true meaning of family. The last quote that made this memoir peaceful was when he said, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood where the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This quote shows the love and affection that Narciso Rodriguez feels about his parents and his home.After reading this memoir, that was the mood that was created by the author in this memoir."	3	3		3

Also the author portrays how thankful and grateful he is for everything he was taught, was sacrificed for him, and for the life lessons that were instilled in him. In paragraph @NUM3, the author writes how he learned that ""family"" wasn't only blood relatives but was all your friends that would always be there for you as you would be for them. The author also explains how grateful he is for everything his parents went through for him in paragraphs @NUM4 and @NUM5 giving mood of happiness and grateful ness. Narciso also creates a mood of love, as of that he had for his parents and ""family"" that he says transferred his house into a home in paragraph @NUM6."	3	3		3																					
13572	5	"The author creates a very warm mood and inviting mood that makes you want to feel relaxed and comfortable. Here are the ways he creates it. He describes the kitchen and how his family loves to cook and entertain. He says that his parents have welcomed refugees to stay at the house that sets a welcomeing mood and that the parents care for their friends and family. To his family the word ""family"" means anyone it's important to remember that because a family could be anyone. That's how the author sets the mood."	2	2		2																					
13576	5	The mood is @CAPS1. The story talks about Cuban culture. He talks about all the @CAPS1 times. All the time he spent with his family celebrating cuban herritage. They would all come over for dinner. Thats how he set the mood.	1	1		1																					
13579	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is made up of happeness, love, and lastly respect for his parents, whitch shows how the mood is actually peaceful.

13590	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is courage. ""I will always be greatful to my parent for their love & sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. Another example of courage is how ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in a country they loved. This is the mood the author creates in this memoir."	2	2		2																					
13596	5	The mood the author created was how they were immagrants and they had to adjust the the @CAPS1 way of life but they still celebrated his first birthdays In that very house. They will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. It was deminstration of how important family and friends are. And that I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.	1	2		2																					
13598	5	"The mood is shown and explained in several ways throughout the memoir. The mood of this short story is happiness and of a sense of family. The first example of this mood is in paragraph @NUM1 when the @CAPS1 says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @PERSON1 is showing that just because someone is not related to another person they cannot be family. Another example of the mood of the excerpt is when is when Narciso says ""My parents always kept to their arms and door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" The @CAPS1 is showing that people who love each other like family have each other's backs, no matter what. A final example is when the @CAPS1 states ""I learned the real definition of family. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned about how to love.""

13604	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is the appreciation through the author's parents. Another mood is the happiness of ""home"" or family. In paragraph @NUM1, the author is grateful to her parents for their love and sacrifice and courage. In the last paragraph, paragraph @NUM2, Narciso mentions how welcomed refugees that just arrived to the country were at their house to stay, that the ""warmth of this Kitchen and humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with life and love"" made her learn the definition of ""family""."	2	2		2																					
13606	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso mood in the memoir seemed happy and grate. Narciso's mood sound happy because when he was telling us (readers) about his life growing up in Newark, New Jersey and explaining how his house was he was saying how his landlord and daughter nice and how the landlord's daughter was his first friend, and he was also saying how his family and friends were very close. In the neighborhood it was despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in great solidarity (happiness) and friendship. His mother and father made the house cozy and at the end of the memoir the author said ""I will never forget how his parents turned their simple house into a home meaning that he never had a home like the one he lived in now."	3	3		3																					
13618	5	"Warmth                                                                                                                                            In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the author created the mood in many ways.One way the author creates the mood is by saying (paragraph @NUM1) ""The very heart of which was the kitchen; passionat Cuban music filled the air. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations"". This creates a warm mood because the kitchen seems like a very friendly place due to the people gathering together.Another way the author creates the mood is by saying that ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concidered family, knowing that they would do the same for us"". (paragraph @NUM2)These are the ways of the author of ""Narciso @CAPS1"" created the mood in this story."	2	2		2																					
13626	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is proud. The author was proud because he was growing up as a loving caring child in the US. Also he was proud that even though his family moved to th US from Cuba he still practices his Cuban culture. Another reason that he was proud is that he has loving parents that want him to be successful in life. His parents helped him keep up with is culture by having family come over."" My @CAPS1 Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary… regularly joined us at our table."" (ph @NUM1) This quote shows that Narciso Rodriguez family came to join his parents and him for dinner. Narciso family gave up everything including leaving Cuba so he can have a better life. A life that his family can be proud of."	2	3		3																					
13630	5	"The mood created @CAPS3 the author, Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives is Love and @CAPS2. Love is shown in this excerpt @CAPS3 how grateful he is for his parents and how he feels about then. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""@CAPS1 often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than i could have ever done."" @CAPS2 is shown @CAPS3 the Way, Narciso described the house he grew up in. Stated in paragraph @NUM2 that ""Here, in innocence of childhood, the congregation the family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Love and @CAPS2 is expressed all throughout this memoir and I stated just a few examples of it."	3	2		3																					
13631	5	"The author created such a specific mood for this memoir. She @CAPS1 off by telling alittle history of how she came to be in @LOCATION1 but quickly changed it to what her home was like. Narciso emphisized the importance of her culture but more importantly her family and friends. she talked about how the latin music, the big cuban cooking all made what is her home. She focuses more on the gratitude of her parents even more than her heritage and family bonds. She's focused on how her parents made a house a home."	2	2		2																					
8878	4	He states this as the conclusion because it shows the faith that she has in the flower and how it will bring her luck for her up coming test. She feels like the familiar flower is out of place as she is and they can relate to somethings.	1	1		1																					
8883	4	"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph by teaching Saeng how to be confident and vow silently, In order to teach her more lessons because of the fact she failed the test in the middle of the passage Saeng tells her mother that when the snow is gone in the spring time she will retake the test that she failed. Her mother was very upset when she found out that Saeng failed the test the first time."	1	1		1																					
8884	4	They probably ended it like that to build suspense of leave the reader on a good note because someone @MONTH1 think things are going to get better for them and Saeng @MONTH1 get her license. They @MONTH1 get more money.	1	1		1																					
8887	4	"The author concludes this story with this paragraph because all things have routins and things they have to do to survive. The geese fly @CAPS1 for the warm months so they don’t die from the cold. The flower dies in the winter is brought back to life in the spring. This pertains to Saeng because when the geese and the flowr come back she will take the test of trying to fit in, in her new country, That is why the auther chose this to end the story."	2	1		2																					
8888	4	"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the last specified paragraph, “When they came back…then I will take that test again.” because it leaves many un-answered questions the reader might have. The reader then might want to read her next piece of work. Basically, the last paragraph drows attention to the reader. many of the unanswered questions revolve around, “I failed the test.”. We also do not know “her gentle grandmother”, “mrs.Lambert”, and “home”. Another reason the author might end the story with that paragraph is to have a effect on the reader. The reader is left to only assume and imagine what things are to come. Will she pass the test? Will she go home? What will happen? All we know is, ”when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” most likely the author ended the story with the paragraph for dramatic effect for the reader. This is why, I believe the author of “Winter Hibiscus” ended with the specified paragraph."	1	2		2																					
8906	4	"The author uses this concluding paragraph to draw the whole story together. She speaks of the driving test, geese, and the hibiscus plant three subjects found in the story. when she says ""when the snow melts and the geese return"", she is referring to the geese mentioned when she says ""She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky"". She went through a change, much like the geese do every winter. She realizes ""that many of the things that she had thought of as strange befere had become...familiar to her now"". We all have to go through changes, Saeng just had a bigger one. "	1	2		2																					
8907	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wrote the same thing that it had in the paragraph and he wrote it in his story but added a little more details to it and problems and things.	0	0		0																					
8918	4	The author concludes the story with this to mean that when everything is back to normal and beautiful that when Saeng will take the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she likes working in the garden in the spring. Also it means that Saeng feels that she does better in school during the spring time.The author concludes the story with this to mean that when everything is back to normal and beautiful that when Saeng will take the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she likes working in the garden in the spring. Also it means that Saeng feels that she does better in school during the spring time.	1	1		1																					
8926	4	The reason why the author ended with Saeng vowed iS because she is very commited. She failed the first time but know she really want to pass it so she is waiting until the snow melt and @CAPS1 geese return and this hibiscus is buddin @CAPS2 she will come back	1	1		1																					
8940	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeng is going to accept her new home and reconize the similarities from her old home and hold memories close to help her overcome obstacles that she is facing in life. ""I've seen this kind blooming along the lake. It's flowers arn't as pretty, but it`s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters.” This sets similarities from their old home to their new home. This shows that things do change but they are also the same. This leads to the conclusion because this is where Saeng relizes that she will always have the memories of her old home and will use them to help her overcome the troubles shes going through.  "	2	2		2																					
8942	4	I think that the story came back to this because that is what the story starts off with. It all started with Saeng going to take a test but she did not pass it. So when the weather is better she would have a batter time trying to pass that test. This is way I think she came back that the test.	1	1		1																					
8949	4	"The author concludes the story with that ending because he wanted to show the reader “if you just try, you might like it,” and that’s why the girl said she would come back next spring when the snows melt so she can take the test again."	0	0		0																					
8959	4	"In this short story, Saeng vows to take the test again in the spring because she knows that she will be able to pass it once she has accepted living in this new place. After Saeng moved, she was very upset and missed her old home, family, and lifestyle. This prevented her from focusing on the test. However, once she realized that the flowers are beatiful in her new home too, she began to accept the changes. The geese being familiar to her symbolizes that she is adjusting to her new lifestyle. Saeng also probably made this vow because she didn’t want her mother to be disappointed in her again. After seeing her mother's disappointment and loving kindness, Saeng was determined to pass the test. When Saeng takes the test again in the spring, she will be ready because she has adjusted to and accepted her new life."	3	2		3																					
8963	4	I think that the author concluded the story with that paragraph because she is going to see if she can adapt to the new country. This is a good way to leave off the story because you don’t know if she will or not; it leaves you on a cliff hanger. I also tink this is a good way to leave it off because he could write a sequal to it and make a series out of it.	1	1		1																					
8972	4	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the main character Saeng and her mother, moved from their homeland to this new place, where everything was different. she was having a very hard time adapting to this new place, and Saeng failed an importian test. She had been very discouraged by this, and she was trying to remind herself of being at home. She bought the winter Hibiscus to remind her of home, but when she was planting it she became very determined to try and adapt, by taking the test, when the hibiscus would bud. The author is concluding by there being hope, and determination for Saeng to adapt to her new home."	2	2		2																					
8986	4	Based on my understanding of the story I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to emphize what will happened as well as to gate back to get to readler to thinking and build te excitement and with question as well as though in the head after reading the pessage. to my self to capture the reader attention as to the following upto and wondering of she survive and was able to adapt to the lifestyle that she was not use to and also see test her ability to see if she will be able to survive the different types of season and to know that no matter what you face in life their is alway more obstacles a head of you.	2	1		2																					
8992	4	the Author concluded the story with this paragraph because @CAPS1 was try intoto let us know what happen after the story was done. and tryed to make it clear and that’s why I think that @CAPS1 came up with that idea to conclude with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
8993	4	"The author concludes this paragraph because Saeng is going to wait untill winter is over so she can have a fresh beginning. She wants to try again because the last time she messed up and tilled the plants. Saeng wants to become a gardener like her mother."	0	0		0																					
9001	4	"@CAPS2, memories, hard @CAPS1 â€“ All are reasons why the author conluds the story with this â€œWhen They come back, saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddng, Then I will take the test again. First @CAPS2 because she failed her test first so it takes some guts and will power to go back and even try it again. Also because when she remember her grandmother it upsets her so that definatly takes @CAPS2 and the human will power to do her test a second time. Next memories. I @CAPS4 she keeps wanting to do this test because she has had so many good memories with her grandmother and doesnâ€™t want to ever forget them. But again goes back to the will power or the want to, to go back and do the test a second time. Last All the Hard @CAPS1. All the Hard @CAPS1 because She knows what her grandmother  ment to her and threw all the things or Hard @CAPS1 that her grandmother put out she saw and wants to honaor or apreciate all of the stuff that her grandmother did for her. These are the reasons that @CAPS3 @CAPS4 the author ended with that Paragraph rather than some other paragraph"	2	2		2																					
9004	4	"I think the author concludes the story with that statement because the audience can then compare saeng and the hibiscus. After reading that statement, I realized saeng and the hibiscus are alike because they are both going to make it through and come out on top, (Saeng getting her license and the hibiscus bidding) @CAPS1 the author might have ended the story with that statement because it shows that saeng is committed to working toward her goal and won’t give up. “Saeng  vowed silently to herself, “I will take that test again”, Finally I think  the author concluded the story with that statement because it gives the audience the satisfaction of knowing what is going to happen to saeng but leaving a little mystery for the audience to fill in how  they want. For example, I know saeng is going to take the test again and I believe she will pass it, @CAPS2, another person reading it might believe she failed again and had to retake it again."	2	3		3																					
9006	4	"I think the author concluded the story with that phrase because it shows she will mature. She is saying that she was not ready for all the challenges she was going to face, For example she did not pass her test but instead of crying about it she just said I will take it again next year. In the story she also longed for her homeland, which she truley missed. She coped with this by buying a winter hibiscus to remind her not only of her homeland but also of her grandmother overall the main character showed depth and maturity throughout the piece."	3	2		3																					
9007	4	"The author concludes the story the way that she does because it shows Saeng’s willingness to adapt to her surroundings, just like the hibiscus. Saeng needs to adapt to her new home in @LOCATION1, and the hibiscus needs to adapt for the upcoming winter. Saeng vows to herself, ”When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding…” @CAPS1 from this, you can tell that Saeng has hope for both herself and the hibiscus. Initially, Saeng was very reluctant to accept her home. She says of the hibiscus, “it’s not like the kind we had before.” But she realized that the hibiscus could be a reminder of home as well as reminder to change for her new home. She knew that if the hibiscus could survive the winter, she could survive living somewhere new.  "	2	2		2																					
9008	4	"The author concludes this story with the promise Saeng made to herself to take the test again, come springtime, because Saeng is having trouble adapting to her new home, and she won’t give up on fitting in after only one failure. Remembering her home and that she will never be able to return are painful thoughts to Saeng and memories of it help her cope with her loss. The hibiscus and other familiar flowers she found comforted her, because they reminded her of home. At springtime when the geese return and the hibiscus starts blooming, Saeng will feel ready again to take the test, the spring represents the chance for another try, and a new beginning."	2	2		2																					
9012	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is talking about when Saeng vowed silently because she is thinking about what had happen a long time ago with her mom, the plants in her garden. Saeng was thinking about when everything comes back how will it be with the return of Spring, when the snow melts how will things be, the geese retorning and she will take the test again, that is what She was vowed silently to herself about. That is how i thik the author will conclude the story with this paragraph included wit it."	1	1		1

Her mother get upset, but every thing turn on it, lk they had egg omlets with bits of melon."	1	1		1																					
9015	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because she can not wait until spring because her plant will budd and it will remind her of her home land again. She can not wait to take the test in spring because she would have been alsole to stayed and she @MONTH1 pass the test in the spring because she did not pass it the first time she toke the test. Maybe she concluded the story with this paragraph because she @MONTH1 like the spring and she can not wait for it to come.    	1	1		1																					
9018	4	"The author concluded the story with this paragraph he/she wanted to compare Saeng life with the plant. For example, in the story Saeng had just failed her driving test and then she saw a plant the reminded her of homeland. From the flower shop to the house, she is comparing her home land to the flower which shows how she relates to it. So the concluding paragraph shows how when the hibiscus is budding and starts a new phase she will too and go for her drivers license."	2	1		2																					
9029	4	"The author concludes the ending as “I will take that test again” meaning that the things she going through now is going to happen again but next time she will be peperd. Saeng has a very difficult time moving to another country and getting comfortable in the place the mother suports her as she go throught winter the hibiscus that she bought is a symbol that represent more than it selfs, in this text of winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho shows this biscus that she bougth when she was in wrost time, she went throug winter with the hibiscus nand at the last paragraph of the story express “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” she is thinking of the feature and how she “saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring.

Another reason why I say the author ends the story with that paragragh because she wants to be, ua eviorment like the one that she was in her home country forexemple there was no snow it was like sping time all ver around. This is why I say that the auther ended the story with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
9034	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she is comforted by the memories of her homeland and really appreciates the beauty of tropical plants. She believes that since it is winter and the hibiscus is not budding, that cannot pass the test until it is. “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the thing that she had thought of before had become through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. “This shows how much she really does believe in the beauty of her homeland and the tropical plants because she is thinking back to other times where things have been strange during the winter and better in the spring and @DATE2 seasons when the plants are budding, so she believes that she will actually pass the drivers test when she feel comfortable, when the plants have budded."	2	2		2																					
9037	4	"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes his story with an odd ending. “’when they come back,’ Saeng vowed silently to herself,’in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding. then I will take that test again.’” I believe that beyond the literal meaning the author is showing how Saeng is adapting to the new country. By failing her driver’s test she also failed in adapting and accepting the new country By vowing to try again it also shows that she is willing to give the country another chance. “She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home..” I believe that this is showing that she still didn’t consider this country her home. She was still stuck on her past.       "	3	3		3																					
9039	4	"The last sentence of a story is usually the most meaningfull. I believe the author ended the story this way for many reasons. For example, I think the author did this to leave the reader with a strong sense of determination. The story quotes, “I will take that test again.” By use of the word will, the author shows the girls determination. She didn’t say she would try to, she said she will, without a doubt. I also think the author ended this way to emphasize the theme of new begginigs. The story quotes, “when they come back... in the spring... I will take that test again. This shows that in spring, the new begginig of life she will take the test. This is why I believe the author ended the story this way."	2	2		2

9046	4	"The reason the author concludes the story with that kind of paragraph, I think he’s trying to show saeng as the type of person to not give up and always to keep growing just like the hibiscus plant. And because she realizes that most of the things that she thought as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season  that was almost familiar to her. Saeng notices that she will still have next season when the plant has grown and the geese fly into a distinctive V again"	1	1		1

9069	4	"The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with this paragraph because it conveys the theme of the story, adjusting to changed in life. So many things have changed for Saeng and she hasn’t full adjusted yet to the way of life. Yet she learns that she needs to be determined to adapt and survive like Hibiscus. The text states, “In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding” The hibiscus teaches Saeng to never give up, like the hibiscus doesn’t give up and survives during the winter. She learns to be determined and even though she failed the test the first time, her memories have helped her and she is going to go for it again. These ideas are in the last paragraph because they summarize the idea of not giving up even if you feel out of place. She has slowly gotten used to this new place and recognizes the seasons now as she thinks this last thought."	3	2		3

Also to make her sound proud and happy to try the test over again. Also I have failed test. I also said that I would take them over but I didn't. So the author put that in their to show how determin she was going to sound."	1	1		1																					
9082	4	The author concludes the story with this to show that Saeng will be ready to take the test in time. She first has to grow and adapt to the new surroundings. Just like the hibiscus flower and the geese. The hibiscus flower now has to adapt to its new surroundings outside of the store The geese are adapting to the surroundings by flying south for the winter. Saeng needs to still learn more and adapt before she can pass her drivers test. By ending the story with this paragraph it shows that Saeng realizes what she needs to do. She needs to stop thinking about where she used to live and begin her new life in a new country.	2	2		2																					
9085	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to develop the theme and to project what the main character will do after she plants the hibiscus, I believe that the theme of this story is adjusting to changes in life and the author builds upon this theme in the final paragraph. In the ending paragraph, the author writes, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author demonstrates how Saeng learns to adjust when things change in her life. In this instance, Saeng fails her driver’s test and to deal with this setback, she buys a hibiscus to remind her of her homeland. The hibiscus symbolizes a new start test once the geese ???

I think the author concludes with this quote because it shows her determination to overcome this obstacle, For Saeng the hibiscus represents comfort and the ability to over come. Saeng is very strong and she believes off of that determination which comes from her past. The author concluded with that because it shows Saeng’s determination."	2	1		2																					
9106	4	"I believe that the author ended the story with this line to show that hope for the girl was still there and that even perhaps the flower had inspired her a lot. I believe that when she says ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"", She specifically chose this time for her to start over, and try again just as everything else mentioned is. When it says, ""and this hibiscus is budding"", it shows that the flower is blooming again, with a fresh start and beginning again just as she would try to do when she tries again to succed at passing the test she must pass. also the tone of which said said this showed hope, she was hopeful and determined that next time around she would certainly pass."	2	3		3																					
9115	4	"The author shows a willingness to try harder in this story. She states that, “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the author realizes that she is going to have to adapt. Also, saying that she will wait till the spring, means she is going to try again, and not give up. The author has a sentimental value to. Insince she is waiting for the hibiscus to bud, I believe she is referring that hibiscus to her country. Insince she has left her country, the hibiscus is the closet thing she has to it, and therefore, she will wait with the flower"	2	2		2																					
9116	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng now thinks about images associated with memories in her new home, as well as images she remembers from Vietnam. At the beginning of the story, in the floral shop, she remembers her grandmother, as well as a well, a hibiscus hedge, and other things that remind her of certain feelings and experiences. At the end of the story, she uses both the hibiscus, which reminds her of her previous home, and the canadian geese, which don't seem so unfamiliar to her anymore, to represent passing of time. She now sees her new home as having familiar things in it attached to memories, as her old love did."	2	2		2

For example, ‘’When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt  and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then  I will take that test again’’(HO). The hibiscus is what makes her feel as though she is connected to her homeland. So if the hibiscus is budding it is starting a new beginning she feels that she will be able to do the same. This is why the story ends like that.        "	2	2		2

She fails “the test” by buying a winter hibiscus after breaking down crying, homesick. By the end of the story she recognizes that she is becoming more accustomed to her new life, which is “almost familiar to her now,” such as the geese flying overhead.

9142	4	The author ended the story with that sentence because in the spring Saeng is going retake the test and her hibiscus will finally be budding. Saeng is going to retake the test because she failed it the @CAPS1 time she took. That is why the author put that sentence at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
9143	4	The author wrote this paragraph at the end of the story to symbolize a fresh start. I think this because when it is spring and the hibiscus is budding it will remind her homeland and she will take a fresh start at the test.	1	1		1																					
9154	4	The author uses this paragraph because it brings back memories from when Saeng put down the soil during the “winter hibiscus” and a flock of Canada geese flew by her. When Saeng failed her test the first time she did not dare look at her mother. She depended on the hibiscus which helped or want to retake the test but not until they re-bud again.	1	1		1

As another year passes, Saeng will be more comfortable with her circumstances, and ready to start over fresh, just like all the plants will be blooming and budding. Failing her drivers test, really upset Saeng, so by waiting another year, she will be able to practice more, and become better, so that when she goes back and retests, she will be an even better driver, by having the time to practice, and start over. It’s almost like a new beginning for Saeng, another year has past, and new when her familiar plant budds, and begins to start over, so will she. Since the hibiscus plant is familiar to Saeng, she is better able to relate to it, and as it buds, and start fresh, so will Saeng. In conclusion, this is why the author concluded the story with that phrase."	2	3		3																					
9191	4	The author concludes the story with that ending paragraph like that because when the spring comes back she going to try again. When I was reading this story it’s says in the story that her mother had asked her “What happened.” And the Saeng said “I- I failed the test”. So I am predicting that her mother is going to help her more with her studying and with her gardening. When the snow melts and Saeng vowed to herself that this time she work harder and past the test.	1	1		1

To show or emphasize that if the hibiscus, a plant reminding her of her home, can over then so can she. In the story after the author had failed her driving test and was walking back home, seeing the flowers reminded her of home & connected her to her past making her felt less alone. For example, when the author says A wave of loss so deep & strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” That shows that she misses her home and the flower gave her a way to move deeply connect to her memories, also when she says “like the geese the distinctive V against the sky.” That shows that the geese were kind of like her they were moving to a different place to start a new. Making her feel that if they can adapt and change so will she over time In conclusion the ending was to futher emphasize her feeling towards her hometown and the new town she lives in."	3	2		3																					
9262	4	The author probally ended with this to show the feeling that Saeng will return and help out again. So Saeng must like to plant. She probaly might hep his mom with alot more things now that she can see what helping might lead too.   	0	0		0																					
9269	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to end the story on an optimistic note. Saeng’s problem is her “wave of loss” that sweeps over her during her memories of her home country. This entire story deals with Saeng’s depressing struggle with finding joy in her life in a new, unfamiliar and seemingly unwelcoming country. This feeling of loss and loneliness is magnified by the test then Saeng failed. After a story of such depression, the author shows @CAPS1 newly found confidence and optimism by ending the story with this paragraph."	2	2		2																					
9274	4	In the story I think the author concludes  that  paragraph  with  the  story  because  Saeng  is  saying  that  when  she  comes  back  or when  she next  sees  the  hibiscus  bloom  again  she  will  then  take  the  test  but  until then  she  feels  out  of  place  and  she  is no use to the  arrangements  she is living in  now  and  she  feels  uncomforatable  but  until  then  she  thinks  that she will not  be able  to do  will  until  she  is in  her  bloms  tow  a  where  it  is  horman   for  her.	2	1		2																					
9277	4	"If you have ever had to move from your home town or country, you how comforting something can be that’s from your old country and in your knew one. The fact that Saeng had geese and plants and everything else comforted her enough to know that next spring she can take the test. Throughout the story it seemed as if everything that Saeng ever saw that she had in her home country of Vietnam in some way warmed and comforted her. Early in the story it illustrates her feelings as she makes her way through the green house Many times in the story you could always “hear” that sense of love when she would call plant by its native languages name. Throughout the story you could always sense the love and caring she had. The author knows how she loves those things and that they would encourage her. Therefore that’s why he concluded the story as such. "	2	2		2																					
9280	4	There could be many reasons the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It could be because Saeng wants to pass the test now to make her mother happy. It could also be because she will need to be able to drive in the next year for some reason. Maybe it’s because it cost her money to keep taking it. She really likes her hibiscus though.	1	1		1																					
9281	4	"The author concludes the story in this way to show that Saeng is a determined undividual. It is symbolic for when the geese return she will take the test again because when they left she had failed. The snow melting and the hibiscus budding show spring and spring is usually the start of a fresh and new begininig. The last paragraph its like a symbol for starting fresh. Saeng was upset about failing the test ‘She said, “I–I failed the test.” By stuttering that shows she was upset. Since she was upset giving it time until she takes the test again is good. The author ended the story with this paragraph to show Saeng is strong and will have a fresh and new start."	2	2		2																					
9284	4	Honestly I'm not quite sure. Maybe because she fees assured now. Maybe its a mental trial we all must face. Maybe the geese returning and the plant budding is a metaphoric test too.	1	1		1																					
9287	4	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the author concluded the story with a paragraph that showed feeling. The paragraph showed that the girl Saeng was determined to pass the test, For example the text states “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”. It shows that even though she failed it once she isn’t going to let that stop her. The girl also expresses somewhat how she feels about the geese and the plant. For example the text states “when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”. It shows that she doesn’t regret buying the hibiscus.  "	1	2		2																					
9295	4	"This shows that she has not givven up and is going to try hard to adopte and do well in this new land. It leavs a sad story off with a happy ending. The hibiscus is a sigh of hope and so is spring, this makes the en time thing be fkor, without this part the story would be a sad one, but with it is one of hope. The way that the rest of the story is told is as if this is a turning point or an end to the en time boot. It is on resa lution without a resolution."	1	2		2																					
9302	4	"“When they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself .in the spring ,when the snow melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding ,then I will take the test again “.So which mean when they come back she has to make a test up ,so they don’t have to worry about it later.But  on there trip they seen a lot of different thing ,the soil was cold and hard they couldn’t much with it.She though it was walking into another world ,hot, moist world exploding with with greenery @CAPS1  frends and ones of shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion .And beside it was yet another old  friend a small shrub with waxy leaves and the dainty flower with the purplish petals and white centers .It was already dusk when Saeng reach home ,the wind was blowing hard tearing off last remants of green in the chicory weeds that grew thre the crack of the sidwak .So @CAPS2 to they saw a lot of thing on their trip.So saw thing  they never  seen before like the wed growin therw the sidewalk."	1	0		1																					
9304	4	"The author might conclude the story with this because it shows that the girl had confidence that when the flower blooms she will be able to pass. Back at her home land that flower mean't alot to her and it still does. But it seems like this flower gives her hope and pride. She used to pick it with her grandmother and put it in her hair. So when she sees the flower, she will think of her grandmother and that will motivate her to keep going. The flower is strong and can stand through winter weather, so the girl is determinded that when the flower blooms, she will be able to past the test."	2	3		3																					
9308	4	The author ended this story with this sentence because it’s a good conclution. It’s a good conclution because it closes by telling what she will do. This is good  because it shows that Saeng had finally realized that she needs to take that test even though she likes nature so much.	0	0		0

9315	4	" Tisaeng had failed her drivers test after she went to ""flour is it and bought” a plant it was the ""dok faeng – noi"", she had fond memories about the plant. She remembered it from Vietnam, and how it used to be everywhere all the time. She had bought “@CAPS1 hibiscus” as a comfort to herself. The  last paragraph says,” “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” Saeng figured out that things happen for a reason and opportunities occur over and over again. Just as the geese go south and @CAPS2 as the seasons change. She had decided she will retake the test next time she gets a change."	2	2		2																					
9320	4	I think that this sentence was choosen to be the last sentence because it shows that Saeng can pass the test. Although she is not at her homeland she still has the ability to do things. As the plant that reminds of home returns and begins to grow Saeng will do the same. I think that it is a good sentence to be at the end and it leaves you wondering if she will pass the test.	1	1		1																					
9322	4	I think he concludes his story with that paragraph because she know she was wrong and she want’s to make it up to her mother. Also she is showing her mother how much she really likes nature.	0	0		0																					
9325	4	"The author concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus “ the way she did because she wanted to show saeng ‘s determination at one point in the story, the author wrote, “she was still too shaky to say the words at home “.  Saeng really missed her old life and her old country. She often wonders when she will be able to go back to it and enjoy herself, because she still has trouble adjusting to her new life. When the author concluded the story, it was done so that saeng could be shown as a person   who would not easily give up. Although she’d had   previous trouble, the end of the story gives new hope for saeng to adjust to her new surroundings. Also, when saeng fails the test, the ending sentence gives newhopes saeng told her mother,”I failed the test “, and she was really down on herself when she said so. The closing sentence gives new hope to saeng and the reader,  that she will work header and do better in the spring. The author shows saeng’s determination to rise above failure   and create a niche of her own in life. In all, the closing sentence in “winter Hibiscus” is used to show saeng’s determination."	3	3		3																					
9329	4	"The author of the story ends it with a very interesting paragraph. This paragraph talks about over coming obstacles and is telling the reader to try again. It is important to never give up and to keep trying until you sucede. In the story Saeng had just moved away from Vietnam she really missed it, and on top of it saeng failed her drivers test. She was really upset. She saw a group of geese flying above her and said when they come back in the spring and my new plant starts to grow I will retake my drivers test. Geese have to overcome the cold by flying south for the winter. The cold weather is an obstacle for them. Also her new plant can't grow until its warm. Her plant has to over come being small until it can bud in the spring. People face obstacles all the time. You have to keep trying inorder to get around them."	3	3		3																					
9332	4	The author concludes that statement at  the story at the end of the story because he wants to show that Saeng wont give up just like the hibiscus.For example the hibiscus does its  best to survive in the winter and blooms and starts over in the spring.Saeng will also survive the winter and star all over again in the spring and retake the test. The author  wanted  to  show  the readers that Saeng is the hibiscus in a way that she has to start over and retry what she has failed as if the hibiscus had died in the winter.	2	2		2																					
9333	4	My response is that if is about winter so realy it is going to be about witer walking around having fun and all them thing.	0	0		0

9339	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story that paragraph because, she wants to show the determination the girl in the story possess. At first, the girl could not help herself and bought the expensive flower. She did not want her mother to be disappointed though, so she was determined to ""pass the test."" In the spring when it is time to buy more seeds, the girl wants to be able to buy the seeds. So the author is showing the trait of determination that the girl controls."	1	1		1																					
9341	4	"In the last paragraph of the story, the author concludes the story like that because the author means to say that the hibiscus is the symbol of overcoming obstacles. For example, @CAPS1 mother says “Its flowers aren’t pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months.” This is a symbol to overcome obstacles as a flower is strong enough to make it through the cold months, in which the weather is rough. In Saeng’s case, she is a girl who will make it in a foreign country. Thus, in the last paragraph, when Saeng vows silently to herself that she will take the drivers test again when the snow melts (writers over) and the hibiscus is budding, she uses the hibiscus as a symbol of overcoming the obstacle of failing the test. That is why the author decided to end the story with that last paragraph. "	3	3		3																					
9349	4	"The author concluded the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hisbiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” because the paragraph its self concluded already. It basically sumed up what she was going to do all over again next time because she had already done it. What the author means by this paragraph is that when the plants come back in the spring she is going to have to do all the work again which was basically the test."	0	0		0																					
9353	4	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus”, I think that the author concludes the story in “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is dudding, then I will take that test again” because she has made Saeng feel that if that hibiscus can restart and make new flowers the Saeng should do the same. Therefore thats why the author added that quet to the end of the story"	2	1		2																					
9361	4	"In the story the author concludes the story the way she did because it is metaphoric, I say this because she is comporing herself to the hibiscus plant. As a hibiscus would be tested to over come conditions such as the cold and forexample in the test the author states “ its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here. This winter hibiscus”. She as the hibiscus will bloom again and have to pass the test of surviving the cold, will be able to have a chance to pass her own test, that is why the author concludes the story as she did."	2	2		2																					
9369	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the growth or hope that Saeng has that she will be comfortable in the United States. When she said â€œI-I failed the test,â€� I took it as failing the test to see if she got over her country and if   "	1	1		1

And with her mother get a little mad about it because the prags she pay for. It @CAPS1 vowed silently to herself in the spring that she take the test again.	1	1		1																					
9377	4	I think she ends the story with this paragraph because she wants to take the test in the @DATE1 time when it won’t be so hard on her. It will be warm again and it’s not quite as cold.	1	1		1																					
9379	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show if they can adapt then she can too. “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. “I choose this saying because it shows you if they are able to come back after everything that has happen she can to. She should be able to adapt to a new place just like they do."	2	1		2																					
9388	4	"I think the author ended this story with this conclusion because, every one should have fresh starts, or second chances. I guess the author was leaving in a message stating if you fail once you should at least try again. When Saeng failed the test it seems as though her self-esteem lowered, and her mother tried cheering her up, and eventually she realized it will be bad giving up and not trying again with a fresh start."	1	1		1																					
9390	4	The last paragraph at the end of the story was the authors way of showing how Saeng wanted spring to come early because she wants to see her hibiscus. If spring doesn’t come fast she will not get to see her hibiscus and the snow won’t melt. When Saeng comes up she hopes she can take the test.	1	1		1

If  Saeng  did  pass  the  driving  test  then  she  would  of  never  found  the  Hibiscus."	1	2		2																					
9406	4	"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. One reason I think is because she’s concluding that the winter is there, and when winter is over, she is going to start flowering and planting again. In the story it said, “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now,….” So, now she has to wait for winter to pass by then the hibiscus will be starting to grow and will hopefully be alone by spring. So, that is why I think she concluded the story the way she did."	0	0		0																					
9409	4	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the story ends with saying “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” The reason the author ends the story like that is because it showing that eves though she @MONTH1 of failed the test once shes not going to give up just because of as adjustment change. The Hibiscus made the reader relize that a plantation where she lives can adapt so can she. "	1	1		1																					
9426	4	"In “winter Hibiscus” the author uses hibiscus flower to symbolize beauty in unexpected places, adapting to a new life, and Saeng's home country at the end of the story I think that the author realizes that even though she failed the test, everything is going to be okay. While looking at the hibiscus she remembers her old life, which she loved, and she is reminded of the natural beauty that can be found in a hibiscus flower. In life, I think every one should always remember that even though one @MONTH1 be disappointed at sometime, we have to keep in mind, the fact that life goes on. There will always be another chance, as long as you can find peace and beauty in something good."	2	2		2																					
9428	4	"I beleive the author ends the story with this paragraph because it refers to previous events in the story. For example it says, ""and this hibiscis is budding"". This refers back to the beginning of the story when Saeng first saw the hibiscus plant and it reminded her of home. This is a good way to conclude a story. I wouldn’t change it at all if I could. Also in the summary before the story it says how she had failed her driver’s test and in the last paragraph it says, ""then I will take that test again,” I think Saeng didn’t have much confidence before taking the test because of her new surroundings but is now that she is familiar with everything and found a hobby she will think of passing while taking the test again. I think she is looking to start over and forget about failing.  "	2	2		2																					
9430	4	"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, a young girl named saeng recalls her life before she moved to @LOCATION1 .She misses her homeland and all of the things she loved before she came here. Towards the end of the story, the author includes a paragraph saying that saeng vowed to take her drivers test again when winter ends, when the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with this paragraph for one reason. He/She wants to show that saeng is strong enough to survive the winter, just like the hibiscus, and will be ready when the weary days of winter are over, and the beautiful days of spring come. Saeng’s mother states, ""…it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months…. That’s what matters"". The winter hibiscus is a direct parallel to saeng in that just like it, she is strong enough to survive the winter months."	2	3		3																					
9434	4	I think the author included that in the paragraph because Saeng didn't like the cold so she would wait until the snow melts and geese return to test the plants again. I also think she added it to show that she would come back to visit her mother.	0	0		0																					
9445	4	"The author concludes this the story with this paragraph   because its start a whole new  day time . That saying  means  that  she  will  take  the  test on a budding  new day .for  example, the   geese  return  her its spring and  hibiscus budd  and  she  has the test  in  the spring  so it  will  start  why the author concludes the  story  with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
9448	4	"This last paragraph is written for several reasons. First, she will try again when she feels the time is right. Just like the geese coming back, Saeng will comebak to take the test, and so the Hibiscus plant will also bloom again. She feels that it is the right thing to do and it will be the right time to come back and take the test. This pharagraph describes Saeng well about how she lives and how she will take the test again when she feelsit is right."	2	1		2																					
9451	4	"I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she was upset that she moved. She is also upset that she failed her drivers test. So she planted the plant and shes says that when spring comes, she will retry her drivers test"	1	1		1

9460	4	"The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think that the author includes this paragraph to show how persistant Saeng is. Saeng is persistant because she trys over and over again at this “test” and also she trys to get used to her new country. It demonstrates this in the story when it says the quote above. This quote shows that Saeng can try something and fail, then be determined to try and succeed again. Also in the story, Saeng has moved from one country to another. This is a huge jump and for her to be confident with herself is very persistant. The way the author concludes the story, with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” definitely portrays Saeng, the main character as a persistant person, and that is the purpose of the quote."	2	2		2																					
9466	4	"Authors sometimes use intisting sentences as there concludy sentence that you @MONTH1 have a hard time understding. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” The author concludes her story by saying “when they come back. Saeng vowed siletly to herself, iN the sprng, when the snows melt and the gesse return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author says this to show that Saeng is not ready to gardam yet and needs to lean more. The mother is verry disapointed in the daghter for buying a plant that is very expensve and shows her inexperience in that buying thigs because of your fodings is wrong. This is showed wha they say “I paid over Nineteen dollars for it."" ” You what?” She also, says “ @CAPS1 facing. Na where did you gott that"" showing her suprise of the expensve beutiful plant.

That if you mess up its okay just try again and do better."	1	1		1																					
9480	4	I think that the concluding paragraph means after everything   else   important and what is meant to happen happens then she will take the test because its  basically the last  thing has to happen and I think she will pass it because it meant to happen.	1	1		1																					
9482	4	"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with  the excerpt ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” because it emphasizes Saeng pain to come to an unknown place and fail her first test but also emphasizes Saeng’s resolve to work hard after seeing a flower that resembled one from home. The flower itself is very important to Saeng, for example, the text reads “And besides it was yet another old friend. a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.” This excerpt demonstrates Saeng’s love for her hometown through a flower that she knows grows back home. Another example is when Saeng told her mother the bad news “I-I failed the test” @CAPS1 attention instantly was drawn to the flower and her mother could only be good. In conclusion, the hibiscus flower is Saeng’s source of stength as it’s the only thing she knows in the united states. Saeng wants to show the same resolve on her test that the  flower shows in the harsh winter."	2	2		2

9489	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show saeng’s determination to survive and be happy in her new home. Although she isn’t happy with her purchase she is trying to make it seem more homey. When  she says “will take that test again”she shows how she wants her surroundings to be comfortable. By ending with this paragraph it also shows a strongness in seasons. As it saeng will start over and try again with her life. She is content for the moment but is planning to please herself and her mother again in the spring. This paragraph also serves as a promise to discover a new way to live and make friends. The  plant is like a symbol of how she is going to change she is going to investigate and pass her own test proving she diserves to be happy and make herself feel at home.	2	2		2																					
9491	4	The author in this story explaynes how hard some changes can be. The author also explayns how family and object frome home such as the flower can be comforting. The meaning of the story is to show one of the author expierances in life.	1	1		1																					
9492	4	I think the author concludes this party because he wanted to let the reader know that it wasn’t it for the little girl and she wasn’t going to give up on planting flower and that when the spring come and the snow had melt she was going to plant some more flower and see how they will do during the spring even though that it didn’t work as well as the winter season she did let her stop her I think the author is trying to say is that if you do something and it doesn’t work keep on trying maybe something different will happen.	0	0		0

9502	4	The author could have finished the story with that paragraph for many reasons. He/she probably finished with the paragraph to show that Saeng cared about adapting to her new place and was not a failure or quiter. The author also probably finished the story this way to show that Saeng was determined for success and to make her mother happy. This is why the author finished the story with the paragraph.	1	1		1																					
9507	4	"The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: “I mean, not like the kind we had @NUM1at-”. This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows that Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept it. This is the reason for the author to conclude his story like he does."	2	2		2																					
9513	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” because it shows That Saeng isn’t going to stay down.

She isn’t The same as she was back home, but she’s strong enough to get Through This change in her life. Also, taking The test in the spring symbolizes starting over, when everyThing is new, and she has overcome her winter. This ending paragraph is so important because it shows Saeng’s promise to herself That she will get past The challenges in front of her, and @CAPS1 to come. When Saeng says “...When the snows melt...” it symbolizes The time in her life when her failures will become good again. She will take The test with a new out look on her life.

9521	4	"Minfong Ho concluded the story with this because it shows Saeng‘s determination to pass the drivers test. The fact that she failed it made her feel bad, and brought out feelings of homesickness as did the familiar plant, but in this final paragraph she vows that she will overcome all her challenges of being in an unfimiliar place and pull herself together to accomplish her goal as did the winter hibiscus."	2	2		2																					
9522	4	"The author included this sentence in the paragraph because Saeng was a very determined girl. She would keep trying till she got it right. No matter how long or hard it would be she would get it done. Just like from the picture of the Hibiscus flower next to the highway. It certainly woked out of place, but it would do anything to survive. Being strong at times when you can only depend on yourself is hard to do, but Saeng is determined from her loss and the perfection of the Hibiscus flower."	2	2		2

9552	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph inorder to show Saeng’s determination. It is also relating the drivers test to the hibiscus plant. It is saying that when everything else starts coming to life, she will also accomplish something. She needs the motivation of her surroundings to push her. Throughout the story, Saeng is affected by her surroundings. For example, when she’s in the greenhouse, it takes her back to her childhood, “It was like walking into another world. A hot, most world exploding with greenery.... Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back to into her childhood world.”"	2	2		2

9555	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph as a way to say that in due season she will take the test that she failed in the belief that the hibiscus will help her to overcome the obstacles. I believe that she she bought the plant when she failed the test, that she hope that with the blossoming of the plant, I will give her a time table as to when she is ready to try again."	1	2		2																					
9560	4	Why the author concluds the story with ths paragraph because its telling the seasons and how they change and how they come and go and they start of with a new season then its something different. An I think thats why the title of this story was called Winter Hibiscus cause after spring is winter & when it was spring they have all the nice beautiful flower thats smell good. An when spring gone its winter so all the plants had died out they not going to be the same how they used to be.	1	1		1																					
9561	4	"In “Winter Hibiscus,” by @CAPS1 Ho, Saeng does not give up, she keeps trying. The author concludes the story with a small paragraph that has an extraordinary meaning. “…in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” by saying this, Saeng shows to never give up, to give new things a fair chance, and to always remember her homeland. The author ended the story in such an inspiring way because it strengthens the theme. There is a lot to be learned from only a few words."	2	2		2																					
9571	4	"In my opinion, the author concludes the story by saying that she will retake the drivers test because not only will she take the drivers test again, but she will also be more comfortable in her life. The drivers test is not the main problem, it’s adapting to her new environment that is causing Saeng so much heartache. For example,  in lines @NUM1 Saeng’s thought’s are ""A wave of loss so deep and strong stang Saeng‘s eyes now and swept over her “and” in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng brake down and wept.” This piches that Saeng is having trouble readjusting to her new life and is reminded of her old memories from where she used to live and cries because it’s gone. I think that failing her drivers test was just little thing that finally caused her to cry because of the stress, and when she said  “and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” It means that she will overcome all that and move on."	3	3		3

9587	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it explains that Saeng will try again once spring comes around. For example, “I failed the test,” (Ho) shows that saeng did fail the test, but got her mother a hibiscus to plant in her garden. Her mom feels bad about Saeng failing so she cooks her food to make her feel better and try to forget about failing. This is important because it makes saeng feel a sense of comfort and relief knowing she can take the test again in confidence."	1	2		2																					
9592	4	"The author concludes the story with “In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” because Saeng fails the test by spending her money on a big mac and not having enough for the type of flower her mother sent for. So since Saeng failed the test, she wants to take the test again and make her mother happy."	0	0		0																					
9593	4	" I believe that author ended the story with that sentence because it give a lifting feeling after the story was so sad.

9597	4	The author concluds the story with this paragraph to show that next spring she will have anoter chane.

The author does this to leave a clif haber and it shows there is more to Saeng’s life but it is still to come. In the story Saeng is trys to get used to change and that she is have a hard time. Her moter holes cheer her up but just like the winter comes. Saeng will Have next spring to take the divers test again.	1	2		2																					
9604	4	"The author’s conclusion explains her feels. The authors conclusion saids to me ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test"" again"", what means is that she is a newoman. For example, taking the test means that she will change. Also what it means is that she ready to take on new thing. For instance, the test to her is getting ready to take on a new thing.

9605	4	The author ends with this paragraph to show gthat Saeng had. Hope. It shows that there is still hope. The ending paragraph makes you  kind of create your own ending for Saeng. I like to imagine Saeng with a big garden next to her and and she passes the test.	1	1		1

Saeng wants to take the test again to show her mother that she can pass it, she bought a plant called. dorl Faeng-noi for nineteen dollars to help her mother not be disapointed. However mother was disapointed that she spent that much money on a plant. "	1	1		1																					
9618	4	"The author chooses to end the story with such a paragraph as this in order to show that Saeng has received a new burst of hope from her memories and the newly familiar things in her new home. The combination of the failed driver’s test and being away from her original home caused Saeng to feel much loss. While Saeng is in the flower shop, “aware of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. “Through the rest of the story Saeng is shown to still be down, and the reader is left unsure if she will be alright. Then her recovery begins with the presence of familiar things. “The pungent small of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth watered,”, “The winter hibiscus’ was in the ground now”, and, “overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faints honks clear and – yes – Familiar to Saeng now.” This realization that the geese are familiar to her gives way to new realization and a new wave of hope. She recognizes the fact that she is now coming to be familiar with many of the things about her new hone that she had initially thought to be strange. This is what the final paragraph explains to the reader. It summarizes Saeng’s newfound hope that she will learn to not just live in her new home, but to thrive in it. "	3	3		3																					
9625	4	"I feel that the author concludes the story with this phrase as a way of showing how Saeng is adopting to her new home, yet still valueing her old one. The gist of the sentence is that Saeng will take her test again in the spring, showing her perseverance. However, the sentence also shows how Saeng is coming to know her new land. She says,”when the snows melt and the geese return” this is important because the geese and the snow are of her now home, and she now accepts them. However, Saeng also says, “when this hibiscus is budding,""  and this shows how Saeng is still thinking of her old home, because the plant is her connection to the memories of Vietnam.  Therefore, I feel that the author is showing how Saeng is growing up and living with changes in her life by ending the story with this statement.   "	3	2		3																					
9649	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph “Saeng vowed silently to herself” because she Saeng wants to do in proper time and season. “winter season”, the land or soil was so cold that plants was not able to grow properly. ”Hibiscus costs nineteen dollars”, and she Saeng failed the test. ”There was frail, wiry beauty to her Saeng mother that touched Saeng deeply”, she Saeng mother is shining when she worked to plants.

9671	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph -“ when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” (@NUM1) because she feels that when the hibiscus blooms she can too bloom by passing the test. Also Saeng is relating herself to the hibiscus. “Its’ flower arn’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it throu in here, this winter hibiscus.” (@NUM1) Her mother is trying to tell her she can be strong also. She too can make it through the cold months. “like the geese she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etered against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.” (@NUM1) Just like the geese Saeng is realizing to be proud of herself and there will be other chances. Don’t always doubt yourself becase they will be other chances. Don’t be afraid to try again."	2	2		2

9698	4	"In the story the author concludes with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself’ in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think she did that to say that you shouldn’t give up. In the story Saeng goes to the store and “touched a petal.” She buys the plant in an attempt to get a reminder of her old home. In this way it seems Saeng is willing to give up her memories of her past. When she brings home the plant and her mom and her plant it in the garden.

9709	4	"I think that the author uses this quote, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is buding, then I will take the test  again.” @CAPS1 it symbolizes that spring brings new life and hope. “But where was the home thought come? The hibiscus hedge? The way her gentle grandmother?” “BOAT RIDE into the night and it was gone.” @CAPS2 from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. one night she had so much hope, like, abundance, then the next she is in foreign land that is nothing like her old home. The flowers bloom in the spring bringing new life. There is a chance to move on @CAPS1 there is hope. There is hope that spring will come, flowers will come birds will come. It is a chance to let go. The ending quote was said to bring hope and like to her and she sort of promises to herself that it will get better. Hope is what makes every obstacle to get over easier and everything to be bearable. "	3	3		3

This sentence leaves the reader in suspense while incorporating the main point of the story and combining them to express an idea about what might happen in a continuation on the future of @CAPS1 and this story. After all, the reason Saeng had bought the hibiscus was to comfort her mother and her-self. While she stood watching the geese, the author chose this moment to express Saeng’s feelings to stay determined and take the test. In the end, the author concluded the story with a string sentence which not only summerized the story, but left a cliff hangs."	3	2		3

For example, the Hibiscus represents. The ideas of resilience when faced with challenge , and the determination To adapt and succeed. Saeng’s situation is similar to the flower’s, which has been uprooted from its original spot, replanted, and forced to try and survive the Winter. Saeng has moved from her beloved homeland, she must begin life anew in another country, and has been faied with the obstacle of failure in reyards to an unnamed test.

When she saw the flower it reminded her of the times life she would get water from the well and and a flower was floating in it.

She is overwhelmed by all the memories that she breaks down and cries. Change is a difficult thing to overcome or adjust to, especially moving to a foreign country. She has to cope with it though, and by planting the winter hibiscus is a way of coping. She knows that she will eventually adjust to the major change for she realized, “that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become… almost familiar to her now.” She promises herself that she will retake the drivers test when the hibiscus blossoms because like Saeng a flower changes also. When the hibiscus  finally overcome the cold , dreary winter months and blooms, Saeng will know she is ready to take the test again for that flower can also symbolize her going through changes.

The author also gives the feeling of hope that they one day will return home. and wandering because the conclusion leaves a lot to be answered. the author uses symbolizes in the concluding, sentances by giving the plant and the geese a sense of impotance in the story and the plant has to do with the home that she really misses.

9771	4	"The author concludes  the story  with  that paragraph  for many reasons. One reason is that the author is trying to say that she is going to overcome  the obstacle  (the test)  no matter what. In the text is say “it can make through  the  cold months. ” @CAPS1 consumer her which supports the last paragraph also, she is in a new country and is starting a new beginning.

Most of all because the hibiscus blooming represents hope - the plant will survive through the winter months and will grow again and become strong. So, too, will Saeng. Although Saeng is in a strange place where she doesn’t want to be, she is able to overcome adversity and hardship. In the same way, the hibiscus can withstand the winter. This is why the author ends the story the way she does, to give the impression that Saeng still has hope."	2	2		2																					
9794	4	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author ends the story in a way that shows that she wants to start fresh. I think this because when she is talking to her mom at the end of the story, she says “In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again”. She is saying that she wants to start over. and adapt to her new country. Also, I think this because she wants to wait until the seasons change to go take her test again. because she says “when the snow melts and the geese return.” She states this because she wants a completely new slate when she takes her test again. That is why I believe she wanted to conclude her story this way."	2	1		2

But still not forgetting where she came from and all the memory left bedide. “…vowed silently to herself …then I will take that test again.’’       "	2	2		2																					
9815	4	"The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” concludes her story this way to demonstrate the girls determination and to leave the reader anticipating more. I say this because obviously Saeng is determined to do well, but leaving the story hanging builds excitement for more action."	1	1		1																					
9820	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she has faith for a new start. Saeng compares herself to the hibiscus. When the, “hibiscus is @NUM1), she will retake the test.

Saeng feels that when the hibiscus is “strong enough to make it through the cold @NUM2), then she is strong enough to pass her driver’s test and live in a new country.

When Saeng told her mom she failed the driving test, she even knew not to look at her because she was upset, it says, “Saeng didn’t dare look her mother in the eye,” which shows Saeng’s concern for her mother’s reaction. However, in the end, her mother was happy she got it, saying, “It’s a beautiful plant, I’m glad you got it,” which shows the mother and daughter have a close relationship. This is why Saeng’s sympathy to better   herself is shown in the story’s conclusion."	1	1		1

I saw the @CAPS1 as a sort of metaphor to Saeng the same @CAPS1, but growing differently in a different area just as she is still the same but in a new home. The significance of the last paragraph is mainly about the @CAPS1 budding. It represents to Saeng her homeland by the @CAPS1 blossoming ,it can represent her love for the homeland.

The plant then makes her think about all the memories and she is comforted by them even though she is said. She uses this plant as a tool for comfort  to  help  her think about when she is from and all the good memories to help raise her spirits higher. So to boost her confidence  she decides to plant it. “The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around. “Then she sees geese flying in the sky which  is kind of a symbol do that day, something to rembember  it by, so the next year.” When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” She will take the test again.

She desperately looked to the flower as a reminder of her homeland, Vietnam. The flower brought back comforting memories for her, so she bought one of the plants and returned. After a discussion with her mother Saeng understands that she must cope with her new home, much like the flower must adapt to its new surroundings. By concluding the story, with that stated sentence, the author is informing the reader that Saeng must “blossom” in her new home in order to do well. She still needs time for this, as the flowers needs time to plant its roots into the ground."	3	3		3																					
9865	4	"The reason why the author ends the story with that statement is because when you fail at something you need time to dust yourself off and try again. When Saeng fails her driving test she is disappointed. After failing her test she went too greenery where she saw flowers of her homeland. Then where sh bought the hibiscus. It reminded her of how things were different. And how thing change when you go to different place. Sometimes they aren't so pleasant at first but you get use to them.

In the story it tells us how much saeng adores the plant For example when she got to the hibiscus She reached out and toched a petal gently. It Felt smooth and cool.

In the story Saeng is kind of an outsider and when she sees the plant she sees a part of her past back home. In the story it says she gets shaky when she tries to say “at home.” When she says “and this hibiscus is budding,” I think it is really saying when she is ready to accept this country as her home because the flower is a reminder of her homeland. At the end of the story it says how see is getting used to the geese flying in a “V” so she is getting more used to this country and when she is ready she will take her test again."	3	3		3																					
9933	4	The author most likely concludes the story with this sentence because it shows how dedicated the author and her child are to gardening. I am guessing that the young childs favoriteplant is the hibiscus. I think that the mother and her childs favorite thing to do together would be gardening. This is a nice way to end a story. It gives the read kind of a look of question on their faces. It leaves them suspicious of why the author did that. But in my opinion I think it adds some curiosity to the story.	1	1		1																					
9938	4	Primarily why she said that was she was saying with time come s cause. She was basically saying in a while when things change again she believes that her performance could change as well. I depicted this by the idea you can tell that she is beginning to sit over missing her home in Vietnam and that is memory with time change comes along. That is a simple aspect of logic that with time comes chase. But I think as much I did properly interpret the aspect of what this is supposed to mean overall. But otherwise and finally I believed Saeng said this because time brings change.	2	1		2																					
9941	4	The reason why the author concludes the story like this for him/her to have a spin off. I mean to me I think that it mean she is going to try again when spring comes so her and her plant can have a fresh start and I think that is a good way to end it.	1	1		1																					
9943	4	The author @CAPS1 the story with this paragraph because Saeng is saying that When She @CAPS2 @CAPS2 back she will take the test over again wich means that in form of test is that wile she was there it was a test of servle and when the story begains it is a the begaing of the test and at the end of the story the test and there leveing and she wants to come back to see what grew. The author is also saying that you don’t know how good you have it.  	0	0		0																					
9954	4	"The author most likely concludes the story that way because that is the time that Saeng feels most comfortable. Saeng and her mom moved from Vietnam, were the winter Hibiscus are popular and familiar to Saeng. She ends the text in this maner because it remins Saeng about Vietnam, and how she feels better during that time of year. When she says “And beside it was yet another old friend.” She feels as if this plant is a friend to her and it makes her feel more comfortable. This is why the author ended the story in the manner that she did."	1	2		2																					
9961	4	"The final  paragraph in, “winter  hibiscus ”by @CAPS1  Ho reads  ” When  they  come back, Saeng  vowed silently,  to  herself,  in  the  spring,  when  the  snow  melts  and  the  geese  return  and  this  hibiscus  is budding,then I will take that test  again.”This paragraph compares  her to the flowers, which  shows that she is resilient like the flower is strong she is determined to take the test again next year and pass it. She would also take the test because it is comforting to her and reminds her of home"	2	2		2																					
9962	4	"He ended the paragraph like that because he @MONTH1 want you to read on, or it could be that he is showing you the comparison between the flower and Saeng. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when. the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, ""The quote is showing the flower can fight through the winter and come back. Saeng failed the test once and is now going back to retake the test. Which shows that they both have modivation and the integrity to come back."	1	2		2																					
9965	4	"I think the author concludes the story with this statement because the author is determined to get used to the new country and surroundings. In the story, the author is showing home sickness. The author see a plant that is know where she come from and buy for over @NUM1 her mother couldn’t believe it. She didn’t want to tell her mother exactly why she got it because she was too shaky to say home or start crying again. The last sentence is showing that author is trying to adapt."	1	1		1																					
9976	4	"The author concludes story with that paragraph because she wants there to be hope for the future seeing that hibiscus budding in the spring is what Saeng is waiting for. It gives her hope that she will be able to pass that test again. This is showed when she says “.. and this  hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, ’’@CAPS1 the winter ,Saeng hopes she will improve and when the hibiscus  buds she will know that it is time to try again .Saeng sees the spring as a new beginning. So that means it is a time to overcme her obstade.I think that obstade or test might be to not cry when she thinks about her old life in Vietnam. When she accomplishes this, she is growing just like the hibiscus     "	2	3		3																					
9977	4	The author concludes the story with that paragrap for one main reason.	0	0		0																					
9986	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", by Minfong Ho, a teenager, Saeng, moves from Vietnam to the United states. She later takes a drivers test, but doesn't not succeed in passing, but does succeed in finding comfort from her memories of her homeland. The last paragraph states ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many raesons. These being that Saeng was very upset about failing her test and was reminded of her homeland and the changes she's had to adapt to during this move. The hibiscus plant gives Saeng a hope to continue her jouney even when things get very hard. The winter is this plants time of trouble and sadness, as Saeng's time of trouble and sadness is failing this test and not being at her real home. The end of winter gives both the plant and Saeng a chance to start over and a renewed hope to start over, Saeng will find it easy to get through hardships if she continues to find comfort from her past."	3	3		3																					
10003	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to show that Saeng is not just going to give up. She is going to overcome the problem. This is a great way to end this story because the entire story is about overcoming problems and if Saeng just gave up it would ruin the story. But just like she was able to move away from her home land she will eventualy pass the test. The mother was also able to overcome some obstacles. Such as moving away from her homeland and having to plant all new plants. She obviously misss the old plants. You can tell by the way she knew what her gift was. But she is able to deal with that just like Saeng will do on her test the next time.	2	2		2																					
10016	4	The author concludes with this paragraph because it fits along with a lot of the story and sums it up well. In the story the hibiscus means a lot to Saeng. Durring the story she relates a lot of memories to the hibiscus. It reminds her of her home and her past so it plays an important role. When she planting it it’s winter and the hibiscus hasen’t bloomed yet. So by saying that she will take the test again when it is budding is like saying she will take the test again when its budding again. She is pretty much acting the same as the flower once again showing its importance. And thats why I think the author ended with that paragraph.	2	2		2																					
10017	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it’s saying that she can’t work in the garden in winter, but “when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding,“ are all signs of spring. In the spring, she will take the test again; which implys that she will work in the garden."	0	0		0																					
10021	4	I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because know matter what she said or did she had to git the flower because it remids her of where she used to live and how It was there so she stared to cry and the test was not to buy the flower and not to cry and that in th spring she is going to grow her own flower. That is what I think the test is about.	1	1		1																					
10026	4	"The author concludes the story with this  paragraph  because,Saeng  is determined  to  pass the test. She knows when its spring and the hibiscus is budding, she will retake the test I think she wants to retake the test because  the  hibiscus makes her think about her homeland. It makes her feel more confident. She thinks she can pass it next time. The hibiscus  makes  her  happy and overwhelmed. She wants to retake the test. She’s sure she will do better next time."	1	2		2																					
10027	4	"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because, it shows that if that type of flower could bloom in different places and go through natural changes than so can she. To me the flower is a symbol to the author that encourages her to keep trying. No matter if you have to start all over and doing it again. It’s just this time you will know and would have learned from the past mistakes. Just as a flower blooms one spring it dies in the winter and then comes again in the spring. That’s the same as Saeng failing that test that year she can go back next time and take it again.  "	2	2		2																					
10030	4	He concludes the story because he was another chance to etact the test.	0	0		0																					
10041	4	"She wanted to learn, and do more things. She loved the way the plants looked at the store. Her mother got the plant, went home, and they started planting it. The daughter loved the plant very much. And she said that next year I’ll grew a plant as wonderful as the oh her mom was growing."	0	0		0																					
10053	4	"I think the author ends the story like this becuose of Saeng's respect for the plant. Not only does she see the plant as a simple of her home but also as a symble of good luck. In the text she holds the plant in a very high value, having payed @NUM1 coins for it, So I think it ends like this to symbolize that Saeng believes that the best time to take the test is when the hibiscus is growing."	1	1		1																					
10056	4	I think what the author is trying to say is that she will take her driving test again in the spring when the flowers are out because it will make her feel more relaxed. The flowers put the author in a relaxed state of mind where she can focus.	1	1		1																					
10057	4	Because she saying when the @CAPS1 grow back she will be @CAPS2 to take the test again.	3	3		3																					
10059	4	"In the story “the Winter Hibiscus"", I think the author uses the last paragraph to show that although the memories  of  her old country would always be with her but she soon will adapt to her new one. Also from time to time she still will visit her old country. For example “when the show melts and the geese return"", The last sentences, then I will take the test again”, This sentence means that once she is adapted to this country on goes back to her old one she still will enjoy their either way."	1	1		1																					
10068	4	"The past experiences of our lives often  influence things in our life, weather we consciously know it or not. In this story Saeng  tries to go to the flower shop and pass the test of not buying the cestain  flower that reminels her of her home, when she fails. She is trying to get over the fact that she is not “at home,” that things and people that use to be ground no longer are. But there are new things that she is becoming used to. I think that the author ends the story with the paragraph that he did, to show that you can alway’s  change. She is trying to put things that make her used further  back in her mind, and with time, she can do that maybe even by next year, because it is always possible to do something if you really wants to do it, and the author is showing that Saeng  really wants to pass her own mind test, so she can further adapt to change, her mother will be proud of her."	3	2		3																					
10078	4	"The author of”Winter Hibiscus “uses this paragraph to conclude her story because it is a symbol of saeng‘s future .Winter Hibiscus is a symbol of saeng for many reasons.  For one, both saeng and the plant are from Vietnam and both struggle to survive and thrive in the new world of the @ORGANIZATION1.  Saeng promises herself that when the plant thrives in the spring, so shall she by retaking her driver’s test.  This symbol of future is extremely important to the story live and this is why ming fon Ho, the author of Winter Hibiscus, chose to end with this vital symbol.   "	2	2		2																					
10080	4	"The author concluded the story with this paragraph for one reason. That reason is because Saeng thinks she failed because she got a fake plant instead of a real one. She felt disappointed when she brought it home.  For example, she said “I failed,” talking about the plant. She also compares where she is now to where she used to live. For example, she said “its not like the one at home.” That’s why the author concludes this paragraph."	1	1		1																					
10083	4	"In the short story, “Winter Hibiscus,” by Minfong Ho, the author includes a paragraph at the end, stating that the main character, Saeng, will take her driving test again. Ho, includes this paragraph to show that Saeng is determined to adapt. Saeng is new to the United States, her and her mother had moved here from Vietnam. Throughout the story she is reminising about her home life in Vietnam. About her grandmother, and the flowers there. “Where was me...hibiscus hedge?.. Her gentle grandmother?” When at the flower shop, Saeng finds an hibiscus, flower they also had in Vietnam. She sees how it has adapted to survive in the winter here. As she is planting the flower in her backyard, she makes a promise to herself to pass the driving test next spring. She too, wants to become adapted to the @LOCATION3 and beable to live here without missing home too much. This vow she made is included in the last paragraph. The author included it to show Saeng too, wants to adapt to her surrounding and pass the driving test,"	0	0		0																					
10088	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show she is not giving up on her new home or forget her old one. She shows she isn’t giving up when she brings home the flower to plant. That also shows she will not forget her old home. Also when she says, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” That shows she is giving her new home another shot and isn’t giving up. Another example is when it says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Here she is accepting the changes and giving her new home another chance. She is not giving up on it."	2	2		2																					
10098	4	"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she seems to led comfortable when she saw the geese and plants the hibiscus in the winter and keeps it from dying. In the story it said,""... their faint banks clear and -yes- familiar to Saeng now"". I think this is explaining how she feels after seeing the geese fly over head because she uses to see that in Vietnam. Also, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”, she gains more confidence because she leds like she’s back in Vietnam. All in all, that's why the author concludes the story with that paragraph."	2	2		2																					
10101	4	"The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” most likely concludes it with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test to show that even in difficult times and new situations a person can never give up and sink into despair and that there always things to comfort someone.In the story, glimpses of @CAPS1 home are given in her memories and from them, the reader can understand what a difficult day Saeng is having. The author is describing these warm, comforting memories to help clash with the cold, bitter day the girl is having. “She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs.” Here, saeng recalls a memory of her grandmother and it saddens her at the thought of her home and her loss. The author builds up Saeng’s despair and upset for the final paragraph. The author has this as the final paragraph because it shows hope. As Saeng says, “then I will take that test again.“you can feel her hope. Also, the author want`s to express how there is still structure and stability in a changing world and that you can look to the simple things. Saeng says,”the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” and this shows how there are some reliable things that can give you security when you think you have none. The author uses this last paragraph to balance the feeling of despair in the story, to emphasize the need for hope and to show that there always things that can give you hope and security."	3	3		3																					
10102	4	"The author concludes the story of the paragraph because, the author would like to finish the last sentence of the story. Also at the last of the paragraph is when she is visualizing and putting her effort to the hibiscus. Therefore, her thoughts are appreciated to the plant. The author wanted more evidence to the story. For example, when it said, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese ruturn and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. It includes the winter time for the plant. Also, the @DATE2 and spring the plant comes back, which the character saeng will get it back, and visit it."	1	0		1																					
10105	4	"I believe that the author left this as the last thing the reader will read, so it will be a message. In the story this girl has now moved to this totally new environment and new culture. The only thing she knew of was a flower that grew wild where she lived. This little vow to herself was a message to not give up. Keep on going and if you open your mind to new things who knows what you can experience and learn. So this girl didnt just give up. Her plant was like a representation of a new beginning. When her plant starts over then so will I. Also it can be a representation of her life itself. I say a new begging because in the text, it says,"	2	2		2																					
10120	4	"THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THE STORY WITH THAT PARAGRAPH FOR MANY REASONS. ONE REASON BEING THAT THE AUTHOR WANTED TO REALLY SHOW THE MEANING OF THE FLOWER. ANOTHER REASON IS TO EXPRESS THE THEME. FOR EXAMPLE AT THE END OF THAT PARAGRAPH IT SAYS “THEN I WILL TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN.”, ITS RELATING THAT SMALL TOPIC OF THE DRIVING TEST TO THE LARGER TOPIC OF THE FLOWER. WHICH THEN RELATES IT TO THE THEME OF ADJUSTING AND KEEP TRYING TILL YOU ADJUST. THAT LAST PARAGRAPH WAS QUITE VITAL TO THE THEME AND MEANING OF THE STORY."	2	1		2																					
10121	4	"I believe the author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus”, written by Minfong Ho, with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, because she is trying to show how past memories can be transformed into hope and determination. After failing her driving test Saeng finds the Hibiscus, the memories of her home land and her grandmother consume her. She buys the plant and puts it in the vegetable garden. After she is done planting, Saeng sees a flock of Canada geese fly overhead. Using her memory of her old home and her family, applied to her new surroundings, Saeng vows to re-take the test, to try again. The author ends the story “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up."	2	3		3																					
10124	4	"The author explains that she has failed the test. While it is still winter and the hibiscus is still trying to grow it's lovely peddles back. As she tells her mother “that she will not take the test again, until the hibiscus starts budding and spring is back."	1	1		1																					
10141	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph To show the final determination and strength Saeng has been given. It’s almost as though it’s taken this plant To show her to get back up and pass the Test. The plant becomes a comporting item that reminds her of her homeland. She returned with the plant To show her mother but found herself too shaky to even say the words “at home"". This shows how much she misses home. But she is able to realize that this is her new home and everything is becoming more familiar To her. "	2	2		2																					
10143	4	"The author end with that paragraph for several reasons. One is to show that she has failed this time, more opportunities will come later. Also, it shows that even though bad times befall her now, good times are still to come. For several reasons, it was a powoful efficient way to end the story."	1	1		1																					
10144	4	"The author uses symbolism to convey a different message. Saeng said in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, and then I will take that test again. The author uses the hibiscus to symbolize Saeng gets older like the hibiscus, that then she will be ready to take that test again. The author uses symbolize to convey more of the story."	2	2		2																					
10147	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng wants to start planting again. I know this because Saeng life revolves around planting and @CAPS1. Saeng and her mother get there food from what they plant. So all @DATE1 they spend most there time in the garden. growing crops to sell and save. They save for winter and sell to get there equiement to continue whot they do. The part she talking about in the paragraph that say “when they come back” talking about the geese. She loves the geese flying over her head and landing in the yard when she outside on a beauttiful day @CAPS1. when The snow melts she wants to  get back at in the soil on her hands and knee to start planting again. Once the hibiscus start budding everything else starts growing. Saeng live revolves around @DATE1 planting. The author put this paragraph in the story because this is what saeng wants to do more than anything.	1	0		1																					
10156	4	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the statement, “...then I’ll take the test again.” This shows that Saeng is willing to try to adapt to this new place she lives in. That is what refers to when she says “test”. For example, in the story she said, “I-I failed the test,” when her mother asked her what was wrong. She spent so much money on that plant hopping to stay home in her mind. She just couldn’t handle that. She ends with the positive statement because it just sends the message that she looks foward to a bright future in her new home."	1	1		1																					
10162	4	"I think the author conclades the story with this paragraph because it sounds hopeful. She wasn’t adapting to her new home very well and that made her feel hopeless.Saeng failed her driving test which only made things worse for her. To make things better, she bought a hibiscus that reminded her of her old home. She found the plant to be very comforting and it helped her get passed the tough times. In the last paaragraph, Saeng is looking forward to the spring so she can retake the test and hopefully pass it this time. I think the paragraph provides a feeling of hopefulness which is way the author concluded the story the way they did."	2	2		2																					
10163	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up and there is still hope. It is also to teach the reader to have hope and patience and the knowledge that things take time. Saeng failed the test of not giving into her sorrows and misery of missing her country. She says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This shows that she is adjusting. So by ending it with this and comparing to the geese, its showing that she is getting stronger. She will take the test again because she wont give up."	2	2		2																					
10167	4	"At the end of the story the author says “when they come back in the spring, whe the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again.” The author concludes this at the end because she felt like she didn’t do her best because she failed so when the spring comes again She is going to retry to do it and hopefully this time she will past.

The point the author is making is that when immigrants came to @CAPS1 they were told to forget where they were from . The word test in the story means getting used to @LOCATION1 and forgetting her homeland. Saeng  says thoes words because she failed the test and bought something that reminded her of her homeland.

10214	4	"At the end of the story, winter Hibiscus, the author's concluding paragraph shows many of the aspects of the story in a summary, Saeng is determined to go back to the drivers test and is open to a new beginning. The author used these concluding words in the paragraph to express the hope in Saeng of a better beginning and to show her determination to pass the drivers test. The author ties the objects in-a story to represent this determination and new beginning. For example, the hibiscus is a reminder of her glorious home, spring is the time she picks because it is a new beginning, and the geese returning show the determination of her and her to resolve to become new and better."	2	2		2																					
10217	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to explain to us that this plant is going to bring good luck. The snow will melt, the geese will return and the hibiscus plant will start budding. Its starting over fresh, a new beggining. Since she had failed her driving test she will start over in the spring. In conclusion this is why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
10218	4	"Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is pretty much to say in the spring when the plant starts over Saeng will start over to. The story shows that this is the meaning because Saeng was having a really hard winter and was having a hard time adjusting to all of the new things, but in the spring she can start over just like the hibiscus will."	1	1		1																					
10222	4	"The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show us that her days with nature is not yet over, for when it comes back around, she will continue to do what she been was doing, whicvh was growing her plants, taking care of them, tuning them out to being a goodnight dinner, and to continue that until she’s no longer to do anymore."	0	0		0																					
10224	4	"The author includes this paragraph because Saeng is starting anew in a new country. In this country she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her of so. Saeng took a test and failed and in the winter, flowers fail but they bloom again in the spring. When the hibiscus blooms Saeng will ""bloom"" and try the test again. Moving can be a hardship especially when it is to place very unfimiliar. People find ways to make themselves promises & to remind them of their old home."	2	2		2																					
10228	4	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by @CAPS1 Ho, the authorconcludes the story with, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt. and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again'' because the hibiscus represents hope and adapting to circumstances. Saeng is trying to adapt to the new changes in herlife but nothing is working out for her.""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst in to tears again.""@CAPS2, the Hibiscus makes her life easier because it reminds her of her homeland, @CAPS3 it gives her hope, ""look how root-bound it is, poor thing, '''the root-bound represents Saeng inher new country. Unwilling to try anything, and getting scared but assoon as Saeng and her mother plant the hibiscus, Saeng realizes that by planting it, she is going to try to love her new life in @LOCATION1 and in spring when the hibiscus and Saeng is ready to blossom, she will start trying to accept life."	3	3		3																					
10230	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they feel that the plant will bring them luck or something. Saeng feels that the plant gives her some type of comforte. 	1	1		1																					
10234	4	"The author conclude the story with her saying in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. to say the she will not gust out like that."	1	1		1																					
10240	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up. She also concludes with this to tell people that they should never give up and that the should keep on trying. Even if they have to take a break to study or rethinks the plan.	1	1		1																					
10248	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes the story longer and it gives it a good ending but I have no idea on what that means so the author should explain what it means not me.	0	0		0																					
10259	4	"The author included this because she felt that since Saeng failed the test that maybe she should be given a second chance because she tried so hard before. When Saeng says “Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” It made her mom upset because she used alot of money for one plant just so she could feel at home again since she had one when she was at her old home. Eventually her mom say, “It’s a beautiful plant” to make her feel better because she feels bad for how she acted towards her daughter. After all the things Saeng had to go through is the reason the author added the the last passage into the story."	1	1		1																					
10261	4	The authors purpose of this conclusion is that every year when the snow melts and the geese return she will have to again take care of the plant. Thats clear because taking a test is a big responsibility therefore taking care of that plant is also a huge task refering  to taking the test again. this is what the purpose of the concluding sentence meant.	1	1		1																					
10272	4	"to show how absent she feels without them by her. You see this when the @ORGANIZATION1 says “when they come back”. also when she says “the geese return & this hibiscus is budding”. Shows how she feel without them and how she will feel when they return and how she will carry on where they left off last time as shown when she says “, Then I will take that test again”."	1	1		1																					
10273	4	"I think it  was  a  good  enough  by Minfong Ho.Through out the story you feel somewhat happy,and somewhat sad,but always calm.You  feel happy when they are talking about all the  plants and when   her mother accepts the plants when she bought. At first, when you think  the mom is  going to yell at   her for buying that,after she failed her test.You feel bad for her but still calm mood and show the girl want give up,but just take her time."	1	2		2																					
10279	4	"The author concludes the story with that because she is determined to succeed in @LOCATION1. She misses her homeland and everything there: gardens, grandparents etc. For example , she walked into the flowershop she smells the flowers like she used to back home. She then smelled a flower that reminded her of her grandmothers “long gray hair, freshly washed …” But by saying that last sentence she said that when the hibiscus budded next winter she will take the test that she failed again."	1	2		2																					
10282	4	I thank he uses it because she wants to get a nother one next year to see what its like to like something so much and get to look after it for a wial That is why I think the nararator use that phrase as his last one.	0	0		0

10293	4	"In winter hibiscus the teenager girl Saeng fails her driver’s test, and then runs into a winter hibiscus and comes in touch with her memories. The author concludes the story with re-trying the test when the geese return and hibiscus buds to show comfort & familiarity. When the speaker says “almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become” This example shows that she had lost touch with the realness of nature and that was what was going to get her to pass the test. The author sets an impatient mood for  the reader because it took her for winter to discover this, and winter is when its too late,  the geese have left and the flower has closed, so when spring comes they’ll be open to new opportunities and so will she with the familarity around her. "	3	2		3																					
10299	4	"The author concludes this paragraph to the story because, seasons change, plant don’t most likely grow during winter time. So you learn a lesson and take it as it is and a wait until the next time you learn basically the same lesson, when the right time comes."	1	1		1																					
10301	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph so he can tell the overall meaning of the story. Also, the author concludes this paragraph because it is probably a moral to the story and gives you pointes or some events in the story you din’t know about."	0	0		0																					
10310	4	"In this story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho , the author concludes the story with, “When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In the beginning of the story that she was less confident and she failed the test.  But this one flower gave her hope and so next time she takes the test she’ll be better prepared. "	1	1		1																					
10316	4	I think that the author concludes with this paragraph bacuse she is determin to conpleat and pass the test. First reson way is that she faild this year and whants to pass next year. Next she is comparing the hibiscus to her passing and sulding on the test. That is way the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
10323	4	"The author of this story was smart to end it by saying she will take the test again in the spring, when every thing bloms. This girl just  failed her driving test she dose not want to take it right away. The blomming of the hibiscus symbolizes her old life at her old home and it is also symbolizing a new start when it bloms. This will give her the confodence to pass her driving test and make he excited to get a new start on the year. ""Spring is when the snows melt and geese return”. This quote from this paragraph states that the snow will melt away and the geese will come back home, just like she wants to go home and fells contible, at home you are contible. The author ended this story of this girl, Saeng, with hope and drive to do what she wants to do. That is why it was smart to end the story like they  ended it.  "	2	3		3																					
10343	4	"In “Winter Hibiscus” the author @CAPS1 sentence is “When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"".. I think the rememberence of home will help her take the test. She use to the geese and plant to remind her of home and by having these surroundings makes her comfortable"	1	1		1																					
10346	4	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I believe she concludes the story in this way to show that even though Saeng failed the test, she will try again someday, someday being symbolized by when the geese come back. Saeng is sad because she missis her homeland and she sees plants that bringback memories, so she buys a winter hibiscus to ease & comfort her & remind her of home."	1	1		1																					
10353	4	The reason why this author includes this story with this paragraph is because it is still talking about saeng and that is more like her and that she has a mind like a butterflye that was trapped a burst out with this open the Saeng and her mom had but a tennage girl me and saeng we kind relate to the same thing.	0	0		0																					
10354	4	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I think the ending paragraph is there to show that Saeng has not given up. She says, “When they come back…then I will take that test again.” She is talking about the hibiscus and the geese. The things that remind her of home. When the reminders of home come and give her strength, she will have the power to take the test. This shows that even though she has failed she will not give up and she will try again. I think that is the purpose of the paragraph. To show Saeng hasn't given up.  "	2	2		2																					
10358	4	"The author concludes this story by saying this statement because the author want you to feel like the character in the book is determined. The ator is trying to put across a statement saying  get through then try again. The character is not giving up, and she will get through the test eve though its hard."	1	1		1																					
10360	4	The reason why is so you get the feeling that Saeng feels about gardening. She is praying for spring to come so she can do it over again. She like to watch plants grow and become something that you can eat. That is way the Author concluded the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
10363	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she can go through these obstacles even though she moved from her home land. Also it shows that she has more confidence thats why the author concluded her story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
10365	4	"The author concludes the story with this because that one paragraph basically sums the whole story up. ""When the snow melts and the geese return"" basically goes back to the beginning of the story when saeng started planting. This is why the author gave the story ends conclusion."	0	0		0																					
10368	4	The author concludes the story that way so she can keep everyone wondering. I belive she ended that way to let us know that she will be back and when she comes back she will be ready for everything including that test. She left us wondering because when she does come back she is going to want use to Read about what happened when she came back and what happened when she @CAPS1 the test. She only made that vowe to herself nobody else because if she did she would have let them down if she failed. That is why she concludes the story that way.	2	3		3																					
10370	4	The author concludes the story with this final paragraph to show how sentimental and important the plant is to Saeng. She will take that test again when the winter is over because it's too cold for nice hibiscus to survive. You need a winter hibiscus. “Not like the kind we had before “(@NUM1). This shows how important it is that she finds a hibiscus like the ones she had at home. She shows dissapointment in herself until that last paragraph when she shows courage and strong will.	1	1		1																					
10382	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it symbolizes the change in Saeng as well as other things. The snow always melts when the seasons change. The geese always come back when the seasons change. The hibiscus will bud when the seasons change. Saeng will try again when the seasons change. But she’ll be a different person also. Knowing that everything will change but stay the same on the inside, Saeng decides she will too. She has more of an appreciation for @CAPS1 now after seeing the hibiscus and remembering her past."	1	2		2																					
10384	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring it’s warmer and more fun plus she will have time to study her stuff in winter for the spring time. Also because like she says in the story it goes along with the conclusion at the end that she finally understood what was going out so she connected it to the way the geese are.	0	0		0																					
10389	4	"The last paragraph was added in order to represent the determinedness and adapting to new things in Saeng and her family. In the beginning, Saeng held bitterness at failing the test. But after she remembers her homeland through the flower she accepts it. Just as the flower will bud, she will be a new person and thus pass the test. An example of her being determined to deal with it is that she does make friends, and, though the food she offered was rejected she didn’t give in. The moment of breakdown was as she got the flower. After she got home it was over with and again she accepts the change."	2	1		2																					
10391	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he things when the flowers come back they would be batter. I think the he thinks that it would be a better test next time	1	1		1																					
10394	4	I think he means thas seasons change and that winter will come again. I think that is the test. 	0	0		0																					
10395	4	"I thinks that the author concludes the story with the given paragraph to show that she is similar to the hibiscus and geese. First, the geese and hibiscus both have a goal, which is to survive the winters. Geese fly south for the winter to stay warm. This is similar to Saeng worse thing both moved to a different environment where they must adapt. Also, Saeng must experience winter along with the hibiscus. The hibiscus needs tobe strong, to overcome winter, from this, it shows Saeng is like her hibiscus because she needs to be strong to overcome the test. If her hibiscus can overcome it’s test, winter then she can survive to cangner her own."	2	3		3																					
10400	4	"The author concludes this part, because it made the story stand out a little. For example when Saeng said that she ment when the plants came back. It also gave the ending a little something to hang on two, rather than staping on talking about the v or geese to get the reader off topic. Last she also ment when the geese came back."	0	0		0																					
10402	4	"I think the author ended the story with that phrase to show that she wont give up; no matter how hard it is she keeps trying. The girl says in the story “I failed the test,” and then at the end of the story says I will take that test again so she is not willing to fail forever. I also think the author ended the story with that paragraph to make you wonder if she will ever pass the test."	1	1		1																					
10406	4	"I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph because the geese that flew down south in a beautiful @CAPS1 formation, fly down every season. So she tells herself, @CAPS2, she will take the test again when the geese return and the hibiscus plant is budding. For example, she thinks to herself, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” @CAPS2, looking up at the geese she is almost reminded of an experience she went through somewhat similar."	1	1		1																					
10420	4	The author concludes with that statement because it shows she needs time. She needs time to adjust to her new home like the hibiscus to get some roots in the new soil she is on. When she is at the orchard she sees the hibiscus and has memories of her old home making her cry but yet feel good at the same time.	2	1		2																					
10427	4	"In the story Winter Hibiscus written by @CAPS1 Ho. The narrarator goes to a greenhouse that has many flowers but one in perticular catches her eye. A ''winter'' Hibiscus plant. This plant reminds her of her homeland and everything that used to take place there this plant also reminds her of  her grandmother's long silkly gray hair and how she used to watch her dry it in the sun and then she would help her knot it up into a ton with a bud of this plant in it. The author ends the story with this because it counters her statement when she say ""I-I failed the test."" and the end of this passage  says  ""..., then I will take the test again""."	1	2		2																					
10429	4	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the paragraph in that way to convey the determination and new found motivation Saeng found by buying the familiar plant. Although she failed her test, finding a plant that reminded her of her home and her grandmother instilled motivation in her to try the test again, she wanted to make her new home in a new country workout for the better, no matter what. “She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive u was etched against the evening sky ...” the author included details about the geese to represent moving on. The geese will go, and come back, just like Saeng. She failed the test the first time, but getting the plant and seeing the birds motivated her to try again. “Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become ...familiar to her.” The geese were one of the things mentioned that has become very familiar to her, in her new home. Concluding the stay with a bit about the geese conveys to the reader that she is slowly but surely learning how to adapt to her strange new home. Finding the plant helped her, because it was already familiar to her. “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. ‘@CAPS1, Saeng said.’ “After failing her driver’s test, walking into the florist’s shop and finding that plant comforted her. It made this new place feel closer to home than it did at first. The geese had become familiar over time, and finding the plant was simply comforting. Concluding the story that way showed the reader that she was adapting and learning to deal with a tough situation in a comforting way.  "	3	3		3																					
10434	4	"I believe that this was a good ending to the story. When Saeng says “When they come back” she is talking about the flowers. When the come back alive. “In the spring” shows when the flower will come back. “When the snows melt and the geese return” she is saying that after winter (when the snows melts) and when the geese return(in spring). “And this Hibiscus is budding” She is saying when the flowers blume again in the spring. “ Then I will take the test again,"" she is saying after all this happens she will retake the test (in the spring). This shows that Saeng will be watching at all these things happening and count down till spring again, so she can retake the test. She is ready for spring to be here, so that she can study and pass the test, and work at the flower @CAPS1. This will be her goal for the winter, till spring comes!"	1	2		2																					
10435	4	"The author concluded the story with that ending because in the spring when everything blossoms. And she wouldnt be focused while there is snow. So when the hibiscus is budding, thats when she will be able to take her test again. I think he wrote that because it means something to her."	1	0		1																					
10441	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show that the girl is going to be like the hibiscus. The next time it blooms the girl will be ready for the test and will take it again and will pass. The authour  wants to show that the girl will not give up and will try again to make sure she passes. The author involves the hibiscus to show that the girl and the will bloom the same time the hibiscus will and will pass the test.	1	2		2																					
10454	4	"The author Concludes the story with that sentence, because She is excited for spring to come back So she can plant more things and watch them bloom, and come alive."	0	0		0																					
10457	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because It makes people want to read the next story to see How she close on a the test. In the story she failed the test now that she changed she wants to retake the test because she knows she can do @PERSON1 now than before.	1	1		1																					
10459	4	I would say that the author concluded this story ently paragraph because they wanted to be very consist. They wanted the reader to have a very good example and understanding of the text. In brief words.	0	0		0																					
10461	4	"The author decides to conclude the story with this paragraph to show the strength and confidence Saeng has. By saying she would try to pass the test again in the spring is showing she is confident and is looking for a new beginning to come then. Also he concludes it this way because after she failed the test she didn’t have much self-confidence. And once she spoke to her mother and knew she was understanding, Saeng knew she had to try again and perservire until she passed the test."	2	1		2																					
10464	4	"The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because he is showing that she will not give up and she will do it when she is ready to. The reason I say this is because she is doing the test when she wants to, when she feels comfortable. Those are the reasons I belive that the author ended the story with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
10465	4	"I believe the author concludes the story like this to show an example of perserverance. Saeng states, “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This statement represents adjusting to change. Soon she will adjust fully to her new home, it just takes time. If she keeps perservering. she will make it. In the last paragraph Saeng says, “when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Just as the season's bring things back, she will come back. I believe this last paragraph was put in to show everyone should perservere because things just take time."	2	1		2																					
10466	4	"This statement shows what the author concludes about the story. It shows the theme of the story really. It you fail, then try again. This is what the statement is saying, she failed her tasks so in the spring once the hibiscus blooms again, she will attempt to complete her task. The statement also concludes how you should never gave up. Saeng had failed the test. She said,""I-I failed the test"". This shows how sad and depressed she was because, the tone the statement was said in was a sadder more depressed tone. Even though sad depressed Saeng knows that next year she will attempt to complete the test. Overall, the sentence shows what the author concludes and think about the story “Winter Hibiscus”.  "	1	2		2																					
10468	4	The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is tring to tell the reader a message. The author is tring to say that if a plant can mak it through the cold winter then she can pass her driver’s test. That is why I think the author included that paragraph. 	1	1		1																					
10471	4	The author is very creative. He concludes the story saying how the hibiscus is building and that she will take the test agian. She believes that she will do better when the snow is gone. The author ended the story with that because Saeng was very upset failing a test but with the comfort of the hibiscus she’ll be able to do better. He also concludes the story with that paragraph because the climax was when she failed her test and somehow the author had to conclude what was going to happen to Saeng  with the test	1	1		1																					
10474	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did because it shows how much the main character has grown. She has learned that if a delicate flower like the hibiscus can make it through rough times she can too. nature’s fight for survival is like Saeng’s struggle in a new place. She discovers that you will adapt to your surroundings over time. Then after that time it will feel just like home. The adaption principle is shown throughout this story demonstrate by nature or a child’s life it’s there. Therefore the author would agree that the conclusion of the story illustrates the biological and physical growth of Saeng.	3	2		3																					
10476	4	They ended it because the girl is not going to give up. She is going to keep trying at this test and wont stop at it eaither. And she will be alittle brighter. She will also pass this test. And this way she wont disappoint her mother. And she will be able to get this test of of her sholders.	1	1		1																					
10481	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph she did because the girl did not pass the driving test. And she adds all of them details of nature in there because she takes time to care about nature. That is what it is mainly about in the story.	1	1		1																					
10486	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the whole story was leading to it and the story  would have been pointless if it wasnt conclusion.	0	0		0																					
10498	4	"The last paragraph in, ‘’Winter Hibiscus,’’ was add because the author want to show that she feels bad because she did not pass the test. She feels disapointed because her mom is disapointed in her and knows she can pass it. While she stares at the Hibiscus then the geese flying in the air, she thinks that she does have a chance in passing the test. Now that she is determined to take the test, she is going to take it at the same time in the next year and she believes she is going to pass it.    "	2	1		2																					
10500	4	It means that she want to do it all over again. It the girl comfort zone - So that is what she does when she upset. That is what the story and the phase mean.	0	0		0																					
10503	4	"The author concludes the story with the sentence saying “when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then i will take the test again” because the hibiscus is not as a good luck charm, when it’s not there things aint right but when it comes back thing’s then out for the better. Also the author concludes this because the good luck charm the hibiscus gave more confidence and when say it real confident one will succeed. Last one not story this let’s the reader know that she believes in something that gives her hope and that will make her so well"	2	1		2																					
10505	4	"Saeng is trying to say that when the time comes again that she will take the test. The author concludes the story with this because it leaves you wondering about what will happen the next time she takes the test. The auther also does this to show that you should never quit like if the flower can survive winter then she will be able to survive that test. Also the author is saying that when the seasons change, things change. She was going to give up because she failed the test but she seen that plant surviving through the harsh weathers and that gave her more confidence. Also she cherished the plant because she wants to see it budding because her and her mother spent quality time dve to this plant she had."	2	1		2																					
10509	4	One it could mean she can only take the test in the spring. But also because her surroundings during that period relaxed heR. When she was dissapointed and @CAPS1 about her driving failing grade.	1	1		1																					
10517	4	"The author concludes this story with this paragraph for a very good reason. The author could write a sequel to this one. She could want the people to keep coming back for more, or wants people to know when things start up again so will Saeng. Ending the story with that paragraph is a very good thing to do. The author wants you to know when the plant and geese restarts their lives Saeng will do the same. She will not give up but instead re-take the test. The author could be planning to write a sequel to this short story. It leaves you thinking so then the sequel will be about the start of Saeng’s new life and what she plans to do to keep her vow. When everything starts to come alive in the spring so will Saeng. The author @MONTH1 love having people wonder about whats coming next. The people will go home and wonder what will the author do next with Saeng. The author loves keeping people in suspense and waiting for an answer."	2	2		2																					
10521	4	"The story ands with that paragraph because Saeng believes next spring when her new hibiscus is born she will have good luck to pass her driving test. It is a good way to end the story because the hibiscus was not involved in her life before she took the drivers test. Now she beleives that on her next driving test she will have the connection to her past experiences, ability to overcome obstacles, and comfort in a time of disappointment. Which Saeng thinks can help her pass the test."	2	1		2																					
10522	4	"The author could have had many reasons to conclude the story with this paragraph. One reason @MONTH1 be to explain how she has changed in the story. Toward the beginning of the story the author sounds discouraged and upset that she failed her test. In her final paragraph it shows she overcame her fear. Also, the geese move like she did. “Saeng and her family have moved to the United States, but the geese feel odd moving too but they come back every year. Along with the flower Saeng is unique in her new life and must learn to adapt as the geese and flower do. She knows that the flower will bud and the geese will return in the spring and that is what she must do. She won’t give up but try again later on in the year. This shows how she is adapting and changing to work with her new surrondings."	3	2		3																					
10525	4	The author had the story end with the paragraph because all the ideas are brought together and to show that Saeng is ready for whats ahead. When they put in the flower they are concluding the flowers importance and how it relates to how the girl feels being happy or sad. Yet when she says that she vowed... and shed take the test again she saying that she is ready for whats ahead but will be open minded to whats new so that she can see were she’s gone from. Therefore the author ends with that paragraph to leave mystry for what happend and to conclude.	2	2		2																					
10529	4	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the main character is troubled because they moved away from home and the culture, customs and even food are different .Therefore, the main character has difficulty adapting to her new environment. The author concludes the ending statement to show that she will not stop trying to achieve her goal. She wants to take the test again change to see if over time things @MONTH1 have changed. The story is very emotional and expresses a great deal of sorrow that is overcome in the end."	2	2		2																					
10535	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is basically trying to say in the spring when the snow goes away and the hibiscus start growing she will test the plant again       	0	0		0																					
10539	4	"The author concludes the story like this because it shows how the main character has been effected by the events or happenings in the story. In the beginning of the story we learn that the main character has failed her driver’s test. Also in the story she had spent a large amount of money just for one plant, in which her mother is shocked about. The reader at that point would expect for her to be very sad and depressed. But because of her grandmother and her homeland she instead surprizes the reader by looking on the brightside of things and saying that when the flower blooms again she will take the test again. This shows the connection between the main character and the plant. Giving the plant a humanlike existence."	3	2		3																					
10542	4	"The author concludes the story with this piece because she said “a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear,” I think she means that even tho the geese flew over with their heads up high even tho Saeng’s wasn’t. “Next year when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She means she will not have her head down and be grateful of her new home and it with time. She looks at her hibiscus she will have found memories but not be sad."	2	2		2																					
10547	4	"Minfong Ho, the author of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" ended her story with @ORGANIZATION1 thinking about the spring because she wanted to make @ORGANIZATION1's future more hopeful. The character @ORGANIZATION1 seemed depressed and always reminiscient of her past in Vietnam. When she sees the Hibiscus and Jasmine flowers she ""brokedown and wept"", and she remembers her grandmother fixing her hair when she smells the Jasmine. To make maTters worse for Saeng she failed her driving test, which is something that most teens find as a big disappointment. By this point in the story I felt sorry for @ORGANIZATION1 and I wonderd if things would get better for her because she was away from everything she knew and loved with just some memories and a winter hibiscus unlike the kind she had back at her name in Vietnam. Then, in the last line, @ORGANIZATION1 suddenly becomes hopeful for her future and ""when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.”    "	2	3		3																					
10551	4	"To me I would have to say that the reason why the author concluded his story with this paragraph would be of different reasons. To explain it could mean new begining or starting over. For example, when the geese fly away and came back, that means that the @CAPS1 are changeing. So with that being said, the @CAPS1 changing or starting over could represent his chance to take test can start over, and he will get another chance.  "	2	1		2																					
10559	4	"The reason for the author concluding the following is because she wants it to be known to the readers that saeng is not going to just give up because she fails it the first time. That she is going to achieve so that her mother can be proud of her and to show herself she is trying to make a effort. It states that saeng will retake the test again in the spring when the snow has done melted and geese returns and this hibiscus is budding. Not only was the hibiscus an important part to the story, it was a very important part to her life it help her move on a see how things change cause over time it will chage and develop and adapt to the changes around it. Yes it was a disappointment to her mother but she sort of understood why she brought the plant home. It might comforted her in a way. There was many different things probably going on where she was she missed the test it wasn’t home. She has to adjust and adapt to the situation that she is in. "	2	3		3																					
10560	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test and next time that time of year comes back around she will have another chance to pass the test. I say that because in the text it states that she paid over @MONEY1 for it all of the vegetable seeds in the garden didn’t even cost that much. That is why I say she concluded with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
10564	4	"The story ends with that line because @CAPS1 draws strength from the hibiscus, so next time she will not fail the test. In the time that it takes for the hibiscus to grow she will be growing also as a person and so will be ready for the test. The story says, “Plants that she had even realized she had known but forgotten drew her back into her childhood world” (Ho). Saeng had a good childhood where she got love and support. By seeing all of those plants again especially the hibiscus she can draw strength from the memories she has. The memories the hibiscus bring back are also very sad. The story says, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her “(Ho). Experiencing all of that sadness again will only make her stronger. Along with just the sight of the hibiscus other things will make her ready for the test also. The story says, “It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet towards the center – just as she had known it would feel” (Ho).The feel of the hibiscus @MONTH1 remind Saeng of distsnt memories, like helping her grandmother with her hair. All of these things will only make Saeng stronger so that the next time she takes the test she will not fail."	2	3		3																					
10575	4	"The author includes this paragraph inorder to show an end to the story and to  show that Saeng has not given up. Ho wanted to show how the plant and the geese represented the continueation of Saeng’s life in the United States. The geese will come back and the Hibiscus will bud and flower, and Saeng will retake and  hopefoly pass her diving test. This paragraph is not just a colosing but a new beginging of life for geasse, a Winter Hibiscus, and Saeng."	1	2		2																					
10579	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that saeng did not give up on the test. for example, she says “I will take the test again.” It shows that she wants to take the test and pass it. Saeng is going to wait until spring comes and when the snow melts to take the test. In the beginning in the box above, it talks about her taking the test. Then it ends with her going to take the test again."	1	1		1																					
10580	4	"At the end of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story through stating, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. The author ends the story in such a way in order to reveal the hope that lies in Saeng's future. After failing her drivers's test, Saeng returns home with disappointment and sadness. This last paragraph, however, shows that soon enough Saeng's luck will change. The reader is left with a hint that Saeng will retake her test and pass. Also, this ending paragraph reflects upon Saeng's determined personality to overcome many obstacles she is @CAPS1. This paragraph proves she will not give up even after she was forced to live in the United states instead of her home. Her success in fitting in with her new life is shown when through the quote, ""Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before. had become... almost familiar"". Truly Saeng is a determined character."	2	3		3																					
10582	4	"The author is letting us /reader know that the give plans to do the same thing again next year when the show is  all gone, when the geese come back and when etcs  warm enough for the hibiscus flower to bud/bloom again! the author @MONTH1 also be concluding the sentence to show that this is the life the little give chose and she will keep up with new gardening till the next spring!"	0	0		0																					
10584	4	"Saeng concluded the story with that paragraph because it shows what she has just been through and feels she could go through it again. If she fails the driving test again, then she use the plants to overcome her problems. She @MONTH1 actually pass the test this time. The unique plants show that she is stronger than she thinks and believes now that she feels comfortable with the plants that bring back memories of her childhood."	1	1		1																					
10588	4	"The author concludes the story with  ""when they comes back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt & the geese reture and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. This quote meaning that once the flower buds she will take the test over again because saeng will have the courage & the will to do it knowing she will pass it. The flower represents something to her that gives her motivation and determination. Everyone has something that modilates them in life to keep them going & saeng has her plant. The author kind of gives you direction & idea where the story going to go also when the flower buds."	2	1		2																					
10591	4	"The reason why the authour concluded the story with this paragraph because when Saeng saw the geese she knew that when spring comes back around she would be ready to get different flowers. Also she thinks back to when she was in her homeland she could see when the flower s grew up from the ground. Although now that she is in the city she thinks the flowers will blossom like the ones back home where she misses alot. Lastly, she describes the flowers as her friends. She also remembers the “Madagascar periwinkle” growing wild out from the cracks in brick walls or tiled roofs. Basically the authour says that she is ready to look for other plants that she remembers from her homeland.  "	1	1		1																					
10596	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that saeng really wants to pass the test. You knows this when it says “And in the warm moist shelter of the green house, saeng broke down and wept.” This passage shows that she didn’t want to fail. When Saeng got home she had the white bud in the pot and her mother seen that she was crying. Then her mother was going to put the plant in the ground, then saeng to the shovel and did it he self. Having her realize she can take it again"	1	1		1																					
10602	4	"The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, “It’s flowers aren’t pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months. here, this winter hibiscus. “It shows that the mother want Saeng to learn that Saeng should be strong even in times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, through the quiet repition of season upon season…” It shows that Saeng realized that the new place that she’s leaving right now is almost the same as their old home- In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that Saeng should face the new reality of the world. She should be strong and follow the flow of life."	2	1		2																					
10608	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because its how each year will begin and end.	0	0		0																					
10616	4	"Since it is getting close to winter the geese are going south. The plants are losing there leaves. Saeng says that she will take the test again. It seems that when the geese return and the hibiscus buds it will give her hope and confidence. Especially the hibiscus because it reminds her of her homeland and her grandmother, when she first saw it and held the leaf it brought a tear to her eye. And when it comes back next year it will rejuvinate her."	2	2		2																					
10618	4	"The author concludes her story with that last paragraph because it shows the relasonship between saeng and the habiscas, and how much just seeing it feels. It also shows that the habiscus  motivates her because it reminds her of her home land that she loves so much and that its like have a pysical memorie of her home land"	1	1		1																					
10638	4	"To me it seam like the whoever was saying that must of been going through a lot of things and that they was feeling like they were being tested or something or maybe somebody left her that she really loved because it say “when they come back"" so @CAPS1 thinking somebody @MONTH1 have left or something."" And the reason I said that the person @MONTH1 have feel as if they were being tested because it says “I will take the test again.”"	0	0		0																					
10641	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she probably doesn’t want the snow to melt so that the geese wouldnt return. Also I think it wants to inform the reader about what Saeng was thinking.	0	0		0																					
10642	4	There was a specific reason as to why the author concluded the story with that quote. The author wanted to show how the plant gave Saeng a new sense of determination. Saeng previously was upset and tearing the plant apart. But It seemed that she realized how the plant was able to bud to the odds and survive. So she now was determined to battle the odds as well and retake the test she failed.	1	2		2

(the only time) One time me my mom and my sister we went to the docter because my sister had a docters appointment. I asked my mom how long it was gonna be and she said “about @NUM1 min.” @CAPS1 I said ok. @CAPS1 we arrived and she asked if I wanted to come inside and I said no I’ll wait in the car. @CAPS1 I was inside of the car waiting and I got boare  and turned  the music on and this was ??? about @NUM2 or @NUM3 in. About @NUM4 later I got tired of listening to music. @CAPS1 I tried to fall asleep. That didn’t work @CAPS1 I went outside to stretch because my arms and legs were tight. It was @NUM5 and my mom and sister come walking. Thats a time I was patient."	8	8		16				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2								
17857	7	One day I was patient was when I tried out for volleyball. I had to be patient because the two coaches had to pick who was going to be on a team and if so which team. My friends and I waited patiently in the gum as the coaches told kids privately in the hallway. They had to do it privately because there are two teams the ‘A’ team and the ‘@CAPS1’ team. Finally there was about @NUM1 other girls still waiting I chose to go last because I thought I could handle the challenge of patience but I was wrong. The thrill of finding out was @CAPS2!  At last it was my turn I walked out into the hall and found out I was on the ‘@CAPS1’ team. Although it wasn’t the ‘A’ team I was still happy I didn’t get out. That was a day I had to be very patient.	9	9		18				2	2	2	3			2	2	2	3								
17858	7	"A time that I was patient was last year at cheer competition. In the beginning of the day I was patient getting in line to get ready to perform. Once we were ready we were waiting to go to perform. After, we perfomed we went to watch the rest of the teams. The other teams were really good. Then are team went and had lunch while some of the teams were still performing. We had to wait til all the teams were done. Once the teams were done they called all the squads to the mat it was award time. All the teams sat down on the mat. My team members were waiting patiently to see if we worn in cheer or in dance. We waited… and waited… and waited till finally he called are name. The junior varsity cheer leader! We took first in dance and fourth in cheer. That day was a good day for me and I was very patient and being patient can turn out right or not the way you wanted it to be. You never now till it happens. That is a time when I was patient at cheer competition."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3								
17861	7	One when I was patient was when we were going of north. We had to pack but I was already done because I had packed the work before my family was packing still & I went to sit in the car because I was already ready I had nothing else to do when I went back inside the house they were almost done packing so I went to the bathroom when I got out they were finished packing. When we got going I had to wait for over @NUM1 hours to get where we were going but when we got there we had fun. The reason I used this as my example is because it took a lot of patience to get to mackinoc city from nbly. That day I learned a lot on how it is important to be patient.	8	8		16				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2								
17862	7	Patients is verey important. But I m not verey good with my patients. And when I am and I wait my turn I end up forgetting what I going to say. I guess I m not verey patient because my family is not verey patient. My family is not verey patient because we just want to say what were gona say before we forget it. Are family it also verey forgetful. That is probably another reason why we arnt patient. Patients is im portant because it helps you be more calm and it helps you wait turn. Thats all I know about patients.	5	4		9				1	1	1	2			1	1	1	1

He looked at his phone right when he got up making sure there were no missed calls or messages. He knew he had to be patient. He was still waiting for the call @CAPS2 still nothing. It was one week and he was thinking about calling the place @CAPS2 he didn’t. Then he got a phone call that afternoon so he quickly ran like a cheetah to get his phone.

The next morning he got a call and he picked it up screaming, “@CAPS1 do you want!” @CAPS2 not knowing it was the boss for the job. So he apologized and also got the job. He was so happy knowing he waited forever sort of patiently and got the job he wanted.

When my brother broke his finger it seemed like  he was @PERSON1. My mom wanted to see his hand and his knuckles and all that stuff that moms always  do. It seemed like it took so long to ask my mom a question if she was in the same room as my brother. My mom called the doctor's office during the third day of the accident and got an apointment  for my brother. I thought okay what ever I'll stay at home while he goes to the doctor but  there was one person in the way of that and her is mom. She said that I had to go to the doctor with her and my brother even though I didn't want to. After that day I kept selling my mom excuses why I couldn't go but she wasn't buying them. So after a very short car ride that seemed to be a long car ride of torture, we were in the waiting room waiting. In that waiting room we were waiting, waiting, waiting and guess what else if you said waiting then you are right. In the waiting second got confused with minutes and minute got confused with hours. Those ''hours'' of torture made the car ride look like a kitty ride. There was no entertainment of anything that could distract those cruel minutes from going so slow. If have ever soon a snail go imagine that six times slower and you'll start to understand how slow the time went by. Finally after all of the time we've been waiting the doctor comes in the room and asks for my brother. The only problem with the doctor is that she is even more boring. The doctor sat and talked forever using word so long it make the @CAPS1 look small. I was so tired that I stoped caring. Finally I was time to go hot no one was happy except for me. I was so happy to leave the doctor. Let's review. I had to be patient when my brother broke his finger. My brother turned into @PERSON1 and had to go to doctor. The doctor's office was exstremely boring. I was patient and finally I got to leave the doctors office. Some times being patient has rewards.

18134	7	Patience can mean a lot of things. It can mean to be understanding or it can mean to be tolerant. Being patient can also mean you don’t complain. Like if you ask someone to get you something and they say that they will get it in a certain amount of days. If they don’t get it the day they said they would and you were expecting it then you should’nt get mad. You can also be paitient if you have to wait for something. If you are getting a new pair of shoes but the only way you can get them is they have to be ordered. You should not start to complain if it takes a long time. You should be able to wait without getting angry that you don’t have them yet. Being patient can mean all of these things. If you do these things you can tell that you are patient. That is what being patient means.	7	5		12				1	2	2	2			0	1	2	2

We had alot that we could do, but the choices were limited. Being patient is hard, sometimes it feels like ages have gone by, but really @NUM1 minutes have gone by, sometimes patience requiers a lot of mental peace. One time me, and my dad were going to work in @LOCATION1. The bus was late @NUM2 minutes, but it felt like a few weeks. Sometimes patience is good and bad. Good patience is when a team scores a goal, the audience was patient enough so that the team could score a goal. A bad patience is when you’re late to work, and traffic, or the bus was late, or you could wait. Sometimes you can distract yourselves while being patient, texting, calling a friend, or talking or playing a game, with a kid or with yourselves. So you see that patience can be good or bad, also requiers a lot of mental peace. @ORGANIZATION1."	7	6		13				0	2	2	3			1	1	2	2

They said the glands in my neck were full and they said I needed to have my blood checked to see if I had a theiroid which is glands in your neck that are full which leads to having to take pills for the rest of your life. So a few days later we went to get my blood checked. As we waited I started to get really nervous I had butterflys  really bad and then @NUM1 minutes passed which seemed like an hour they called me in and I sat down the nurse said everything will be fine.

I sure hope your not screaming at @PERSON1!â€� â€œ@CAPS4 I was, but thatâ€™s only because @PERSON1 wonâ€™t hurry up!â€� @CAPS5 exclaimed. â€œ@CAPS4 @CAPS5 says sorry to @PERSON1 then for being so sour and not letting him take his time. Heâ€™s younger then you, which means he doesnâ€™t know any better.â€� @CAPS8, @PERSON2, exclaimed forcefully.â€�  Iâ€™m so sorry @PERSON1!â€� @PERSON3 said with a tear trickling down her cheak. So they gave each others hugs, and went on patiently with their game of sorry."	11	12		23				3	3	2	3			3	3	3	3

Out of nowhere, my bright light flashed on and I squinted and put the blanket over my head. My dad yelled, “it’s time to go, @CAPS1!” I replied “okay!” I quickly flung out of bed, got dressed, ate breakfast, grabbed my bag and put it in the trunk of my mom’s car. It was the middle of @DATE1, and we were on our way to @LOCATION1. I knew I had to be patient, so I popped a movie in the @CAPS2 player for me and my brother @CAPS3 to watch. It started to get lighter out and I was still watching movies whele everyone else was asleep. Exect for my dad of course he was the driver. When everyone woke up we stopped for food and gas. I was very patient, because I had to wait for everyone to wake up before I got to eat. After we ate we got back in the car and drove off. A couple hours later, we got to @LOCATION1.

18553	7	"Have you ever been patient? At some times, people lose their patients at many things. Examples of losing patients can be waiting in a line to go on a roller-coaster, because sometimes that can take forever.  Having patients can be a good thing. Your calm and you don’t have to be upset at somethings like waiting in a line somewhere for a long time. Being a patient person also means that you have the ability to wait for something, unlike people without patients, because those people will struggle while waiting for something. In conclusion, I think that having patients will sometimes help you to suceed in life. If your un-patient than you should try not to be because the thing you want or your waiting for will eventually happen someday."	6	5		11				1	1	2	2			1	1	1	2								
18559	7	One time @CAPS1 mom took a test to become a @CAPS2. That means certified nursing assistant. After she took the test she was very nervous. She waited and waited. A phone call would come very soon but she had to have patients. The first day she took the test it was very hard to have patients. I understoond because I get that feeling when I’m waiting for test results. It is nerve racking and exciting. The next day was not as hard. She just went on with her day. The third day of waiting she started wondering if the call would come. Later that day the phone rang. A smile spread across her face. She had passed the test. This is a time @CAPS1 mom showed patients for three whole days!	9	10		19				2	2	2	3			3	2	2	3								
18565	7	"What is patience? Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining most people are impatient these days. Patience is like waiting. For example, if you are in a traffic jam in a long line, or maybe you have to wait your turn for something. Patience is one of the best qualities someone could have. Every year more people become impatient. @CAPS1 want people to “hurry” or “move faster.” @CAPS1 need to gain patience by taking deep breaths or calming down. I think the world would be more peaceful if everybody had patience there would be no more conflict and if that happened some day, everybodies lives would be perfect."	7	6		13				0	2	2	3			0	2	2	2

18584	7	"Don't you just love waiting for something to come or happen and when it does you realize it was all worth waiting for? I know I do! Sometimes its too long of a wait and you just have to be patient. Patience is very important. I have had to use patience many times before .Recently, I have had to use patience. I used it to wait for my baby cousin @CAPS1 to be born. I had to wait a long time @NUM1 weeks to be exact! I was just so excited I couldnt keep myself together. Now just yesterday she was born. The wait is over and I feel a reat. Although, I still have to be patient to see her. But not much longer only untill I get out of school. I have been waiting so long I can't even stand it! Every day I used to mark it on my calendar. I used to tell myself. She will be here soon. But, the days never seam to go by fast enough. I kept asking my mom, how many more days. It was pure agony! As the day approached I got more excited. She had gotten a lot of clothes from people. I had to be even more patient to even see the clothes on her. I also had to be patient to hold her. Although I did already say a while back that I got to be the first cousin to hold her. Now that she is born and finally here, I get to be the first one to hold her, I can stop counting down, get to see her in her new clothes and can stop bothering my mom. So, all in all patience is important. If you use it, the thing you are waiting for is much better."	9	12		21				2	2	2	3			3	3	3	3

18609	7	"Patience is about waiting for something and not complaining about it. When you are patient you wait for something with out complaining. If you are waiting for something and you start to complain that means you don't have much patience. It isn't really good to not have patience. Some people do not have patience at all, and if they don't that is not good. If you do have patience that is good, but some people don't and it is not good, because if something that you have to wait for and it is important, and you have no patience that could be bad. Some people have good patience  but sometimes even if you have good patience you can still sometimes complain. And that is what patience is."	6	5		11				0	1	2	3			0	1	2	2

The party was spectacular! There were stockings hung over the fireplace, green and red streamers everywhere, and huge @CAPS1 tree in the living room. Under the @CAPS1 tree, there was a large pile of presents-each one for the children. My neighbor saw me staring at the presents, so he walked over, picked up a present, and handed it to me. The present was a rectangular shape wrapped in blue gift wrap decorated with snowflakes. On the front was my name in marker. I was about to open my present when my neighbor told me to wait. He said that if I opened it now, I would only get one gift. If I waited until @CAPS1 morning to open it, I would get two gifts. I didn’t understand it at first, but he said I soon would. @CAPS1 was a week away! How in the world was I suppose to wait until then? Of course I wanted two gifts, so I told my neighbor I would wait. Deep down inside though, I wanted to tear the present right open. The days dragged on. Why was the week going by so slowly? As @CAPS1 drew near, I grew impatient. I almost opened my present three days before @CAPS1. Finally, on the twenty-fifth of @DATE1, I was able to open my present. Instead of quickly unwrapping it like I planned to, I slowly tore the paper away… and found a lovely velvet diary with golden boarders.

18685	7	"Im @PERSON1 and a year ago I was a foster kid. I had to have patience for a lot of things. First of all, my foster parents got divorced with kids. I had to have patience waiting till my foster mom found a home to move to. Secondly I wasn’t told when I could go home. I had to wait till everything was over. Finally, they told me after a year and a half that I could go home to my mom within a week. I packed and waited. I had to have patience with everyone. It was hard, extremely hard, mind crazy hard. It took two weeks and a day to get home and on top of all that I had to move all my stuff home and unpack to this day I am still unpacking. Being a foster takes a lot of patience. I learned that."	12	8		20				3	3	3	3			2	2	2	2

18720	7	Patience is a thing that you develop when you are calm and relaxed. I have been patient everyday in school. Being patient with my teachers. I have been patient with kids at school that like to pic on people and tease them. I have patients some days and others that means something is going wrong and that means I don’t have any more. I like having patients because it makes you get relaxed and everything. Patients is a good thing that you can have. I think patents increases your life span. Many people in the world don’t have that many patients and I think that decreases your life span. I don’t think if I didn’t have any patients I wouldn’t be in school right now cause some kids just have problems and they and don’t have and they get bad grades and everything.	5	5		10				0	1	2	2			0	1	2	2

18741	7	"Being patient is one of the many things children are taught while growing. They mature and we use these life lessons & life guidences when they need them. I can’t tell you how many times my mother told me to be patient. It was used daily while I was growing up. I gradually learned though, & realized how important being patient is. If your being impatient, you have to understand, that the people are most likely trying their hardest to finish what they are doing for your sake. I truly found the meaning of this word when I was seven years old at the mall. Although I had experience this importance & knowing I had to wait, earlier in my life, it didn’t mean I was content, and patient. We were shopping in my favorite store at the time called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I had gotten a moutain of clothes as well as my sister @PERSON1 who was @NUM1. A dressing room had finally opened after the long wait of about @NUM2 minutes. Suddenly a dressing room opened, @ORGANIZATION1 raced in it. I was crying because I was before her, &it was unfair. She cut me anyways. I was the one who waited @NUM2 minutes. After her fashion show with my mom for about @NUM4 minutes, I was done. I wanted to try on my clothes. I knocked on the door, & she told me she would move it along. So I waited another @NUM5 minutes and she was out. It was a rewardance to my patience that got me into the dressing room. I count that day that wether it’s a long or short wait, you will get what you want in the long run. So be patient, and good things will come your way like karma what comes around, goes around."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

18904	7	"Patience, @CAPS6 essential part of our world. Patience @CAPS5 deffeniatly some thing everybody needs. but not everybody has. I believe that everybody needs patience because everything takes time. And if you “don’t have the time” to do something then you don’t have the time to live. And if nobody had the time to live then I wouldn’t be here right now. I believe that patience @CAPS5 more than just its deffinition. I believe that it means to be able to a low time to pass so you can do something. If all you did was work then good have a pretty boring life. For example if you had a @CAPS1 teacher for @CAPS6 elective class. She would have to be patient to be able to teach you the language of @CAPS1. Otherwise she probably wouldn’t be a teacher. Another example would be that lets say your on @NUM1 and your going to go to @LOCATION1. But traffic @CAPS5 holding you down because of a @NUM2 car pile up. and you  honk your horn. Thats not going to speed things up any more than they already are. Maybe your timing @CAPS5 perfect when your honk but it doesnt make anything go any faster. When people hear someone honk their horn it most likely comes up as “@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 PERSON @CAPS8 @CAPS9.” @CAPS10 @CAPS5 pretty much correct. When you honk your horn in traffic it doesnt make anything go faster, it makes things seem longer and people instantly label you as @CAPS11. In conclusion I would like to state that patience @CAPS5 important to mankind because if nobody had patience nobody would be on earth right now"	8	6		14				1	1	3	3			0	2	2	2

I was warming up, doing wrist flicks, 'k-s', one leg throw, arm circles, and screw ball flicks. My catcher, @PERSON1, caught the ball everytime. @PERSON3 said," @CAPS1. Let me see your screwball and rise ball." I took my place on the mound and threw my screw ball. It curved right and the glove cracked." "@CAPS2! Excellent! Hey you! Give me a high five!" @PERSON1 said. I slapped her hand and we both said "@CAPS3!" "@CAPS4, @CAPS4 good. Now throw me a rise," @PERSON2 said. I threw one. @PERSON3 gave me pointers after I had thrown three rise balls." You are doing good. Just keep your legs open and your arm flicking up a little more," he said. He never lost patient with me. Not ever after one rise ball almost hit the ceiling. He just kept working with me. After many more pitches I had finally got it. We finished our pitching session ten minutes later. @PERSON3 told me I was doing great. He said we would work on it again on @DATE2." @CAPS5 is @DATE1.

About @NUM3 minutes later @CAPS3 line started pulling @CAPS1 helps her reach it in, it was a clam the size of my thumb. Everyone was so patient but no one caught anything else. Now it was @NUM4 pm and we decided to go home. @PERSON2 was happy. Everyone was just being patient and waiting to catch something but @PERSON2 was also very patient because she had to use the bathroom for most of the time we were on the boat. I think most of us on the boat had to secretly use the bathroom after being there for so many hours. When we got home  we told evryone what we caught,which was nothing for everyone besides for @PERSON3 and her tiny clam. I know lots of people who wouldnt last on that boat for an hour.

Eat breakfast, comb hair, get dressed, brush teeth, and go to school. Later, when I came home, my mom announced that my dad will arrive with my puppy in @NUM1 minutes. So I sat on my chair, in my room and watched the clock tic and toc for about @NUM2 minutes. Then, I walked in to the living room, where the rest of my family was sitting and waited till I heard a door slam. Suddenly. Boom! The door slammed on my dads truck. My mom, brother, and sister bolted to the door as I simply walked to see the puppy. “aww!” everyone screamed. “@CAPS1 I hold her,” and “she’s my dog,” and “let’s name her” also came in the conversation. Then, my dad glared at me, standing their quietly and handled me the dog. “you are being so patient, you @CAPS1 be the one to hold her first!” I was so proud of myself.

One good thing patience can get you to good places. Being patient is a polite way to go. So if your all prep you want to go down the patient way. Not being patient is just disrespect.

And I was really hungry so I ate it very fast so when I was done they gave me a free descont because of the mixup they had with my meal.

Another stepped in the bathroom and I quickly went there and said “@CAPS1, excuse me but my mom is coming, she’s been waiting.

19270	7	"I’m constantly patient moioly because of my younger sister. Sometimes its easier than others to be patient with her, but most of the time I’m able to manage. I think this is a great example. One chilly @DATE1 @TIME1 I was in my mothers room and I saw her doing her make-up. I asked “@CAPS1 did you get @CAPS5 good at putting make-up?” @CAPS2 responded “with patience and years of practice.” The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom “@CAPS3 mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1, later?” @CAPS2 replies “@CAPS4, @CAPS9?” I answered “@CAPS5 I can get some make-up to practice with”. “@CAPS6.” @CAPS2 says. When we get there, there’re @CAPS5 many choices to chose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones! After we check out; its time to go home and practice! Sadly my first lesson in make-up didn’t go to great, but I did ask my mom for some help and @CAPS2 said “@CAPS8, I know you’ll catch on soon!” and I wondered out loud “@CAPS9?,’ @CAPS2 almost said as a whisper “because any can pay someone else to do their make-up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patients to learn it their self.”"	12	10		22				3	3	3	3			2	3	3	2

While we are there we fish for sharks and sting rays, hang out on the beach and swim in the ocean or the pool. So it is absolutely worth the wait.

19273	7	"I remember it all clear as glass ice. It was two summers ago when my mom, two brothers, and I went to @PERSON1 point. The car ride was about an hour and a half, maybe two hours. I was really excited about going on the new ride at @CAPS1 point- the @CAPS5. With nothing to do but listen to music and stare out the window, this car ride was turning into forever. Of course, once we got there we still had to go on lots of other rides. We usually start at the front and work hack, doing things in order. This I didn’t mind since we went on mostly big rollar coasters with a few acceptions for rides like @PERSON2 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and @ORGANIZATION1. My mind was kept plenty distracted from the maverick with how mad, fun I was having at the time. Unfortunately, it became harder to keep my patience once we got to the @CAPS5 since  the line was nearly an hour and a half long. I guess that the line was to be expected considering that it was a new ride. After waiting for so long we finally got to the ride it. The @CAPS5 was amazingly epic. Finally, all of my patience had payed off, and I had a great day."	10	12		22				3	3	2	2			3	3	3	3

19282	7	"Being patience is what you need to get anything done in the world. One example is school how do you use patience. A way is being understanding to your teacher because they’re there to help you to teach you for life. If you don’t be patient and understand your teacher you will get nowhere in life. Another example is with your parents. You need to be tolerant with them they were tolerant with you. If you don’t have patience with you parents and don’t listen to them then you won’t learn all the life lessons they give you, without their skills you will get nowhere in life."	5	5		10				0	1	2	2			0	1	2	2								
19283	7	Once I knew a girl whos name was @ORGANIZATION1 and met another girl named @PERSON1. They had been inseperable until high school. @ORGANIZATION1 had gotten many more friends and started becoming very popular. @PERSON1 called @ORGANIZATION1 everyday to see how she was and or if she wanted to hangout. @ORGANIZATION1 kept lieing to @PERSON1 saying she was busy and always said lies and blowing her off. But one day @ORGANIZATION1 had a very bad day and when she tried to tell her new friends about it and apologized how she was acting. @ORGANIZATION1 had learned that @PERSON1 really was a true friend and was patient with @ORGANIZATION1 through the bad times. This shows that if you are truly patient only good thing can come.	8	10		18				2	2	2	2			2	3	2	3

It was on the following @DATE1 when I was at my cousin’s house and my mom came in and surprised me with my new phone and I was so happy that I finally got it.

19409	7	A time when I was patient was yesterday when I finished the @CAPS1 before a lot of people and was drawing for the next @NUM1 minutes. I was patient throuout this time because if wasn’t I might’ve been very loud and disrupted my fellow classmates. I started to draw or color as some might say because instead of drawing a smiley face I colored in boxes on math graphing paper to make a sort of lime green and purple checker board. It took the entire time and I am still not done with it. That is a time I remember when I was quite patient.	10	10		20				2	3	2	3			2	3	2	3

19502	7	"Being patient is waiting quietly for something to happen. A lot of times, you have to patient for a lot of things, such as long lectures, birthdays, and orchestra concerts. Sometimes, no matter how patient you are, the thing you have been waiting for does not happen, and you’d have to leave without doing what you wanted to do for the whole time (and that has happened many times with me). For long lectures, sometimes you have the urge to leave. You have to be patient and wait for the lecture to end. For birthdays, you really want to eat the cake. But, yes, you do have to wait until your annoying sister finishes blowing out the candles and makes her wish. I am part of the orchestra, and we have a orchestra @ORGANIZATION1 about every two months. The first @ORGANIZATION1 is an open @ORGANIZATION1, and they are usually in @NUM1. Last year it was the @NUM2. At the end of the @ORGANIZATION1, there is a cheese cake sampling station, and cookies, and domus, and all these good cake. But first, I must suffer through playing through many pieces, watch the beginners play and watching at honid video ??? videotapes my face, waiting for a mistake so any annoying can laugh at it and call me an “epicfail”. But I still live. Playing the piece isn’t so bad, it’s just some pieces of paper with notes and watching the beginners might is torture, but at least I don’t have to play. Video @CAPS1? No pain at all.  Who says I’m going to mess up? All I have to do is to sit in the back row, and my mom might not even see me. My sisters might not even care. And then soon comes the cheese cake, at like @NUM3 at night. That is the good part, but to get to the good part, I must be patient. I’m not really looking forward to this year’s @ORGANIZATION1, on @DATE1, because on that day I have a final cross-country meet after school. Where all five middle schools come together for a big district meet at a place called @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2. After that meet, my parents have to bring me to that @ORGANIZATION1 at the high school at @TIME1. The @ORGANIZATION1 closes down at @NUM4, like always, and I am hoping I’m not going to get any homework. But if I do, I’ll just have to be patient. That day is like any old day. @NUM5. I’ll have to wait until school ends, the meet ends, and the @ORGANIZATION1 ends to go home, but I can live.

This resulted to being a problem because the dirigible could go anywhere, not landing in the mast properly and cause damage. With this problem also came risks for pedestrians who are on the streets.

14986	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while constructing a mast that would make it possible for dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of all was nature itself. It was unrealistic to have a dirigible tied by a single cable tether to remain intact when the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mast which was hazardous for pedestrians. There was nothing the builders could do to alter nature so their ideas soon became unrealistic. Another obstacle the builders faced while constructing the building was that the dirigible's weight would add to much stress (especially with added wind pressure) to the building's frame. They then decided the only way to fix that problem was to shift the weight to the building's foundation.	3	3		3

A big issue was safety. The dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The highly flammable substance was too dangerous to use above New York. The greatest issue was the wind.

15000	6	"In the passage, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, a myriad of obstacles had faced the builders of the Empire State Building in terms of allowing dirigibles to dock there. First was the problem of constructing a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. Because, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame,"" the building would be unable to support the stress of both the dirigible and wind pressure. Next, safety became an issue. After the discovery that, ""most dirigible's built outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"", owners of the Empire State Building realized the hazard involved when having a highly flammable object fly over a densely populated area. This was brought to their attention when a German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. An addition problem was nature itself. The winds on top of the building posed the problem of having the dirigibles back end swivel around the mooring mast, seeing as weights could not be used to weight the back down since they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. Lastly, there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2, it would be illegal for a Ship to be tied up to the building or approach the area. In light of the aforementioned reasons, it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	4		4																					
15004	6	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 she describies the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Three of the main obsticles they faced where there was a lack of suitble landing area, they would have to reconstruct the building's framework, and there was a law against it. The Dirigibles are enormous steel framed balloons, that have envelopes of cotton fabric. They are also filled with hydrogen and Helium to make them lighter and float eayser. As a result of the Dirigibles being so large, some over one thousand feet, there was really no place for them to land. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state Buildings flat roof, it would add to much stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another obsticle being faced was they would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars to the building's framework just so the building could support the Dirigible. The third obsticle faced was there was a law agianst it. It claimed that there would be no airships flying too low over urban areas. So even if they did build a landing area, and spend the sixty thousand dollars on the building's framework they wouldnt be able to use them because of the law. Even though the idea of having a dirigible dock on the Empire State building the obsticles too face were to great for the builders with the lack of a sutible landing area, the reconstructing of the framework, and the law agianst aircrafts flying to low."	4	4		4

The builders faced a problem with the architect of building. The roof top was a flat as it says ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" That meant the heavy dirigible would add stress to the building's frame Another issue they faced was the gas some dirigible used @CAPS1 dirigibles were filled with different gases and ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than Helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.""

""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (Lüsted, @NUM1). The inefficient the gases, the violent air currents would either cause the dirigible to spend, or add lead weights which would ""... be dangling high above pedestrians"" (Lüsted, @NUM2). Among all of these problems ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (Lüsted, @NUM3).

15053	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before construction ever took place. The main reason for this was safety. First, there was a chance that it could catch on fire. For example, most dirigibles are made of hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. They relized how much damage it could do if it caught on fire in a densely populated area, such as downtown New York. Secondly, they had another obstacle to the successful use of the mooring that was nature itself. For example, the wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Lastly dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because they was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it. Instead of becoming the transportation of the future the idea had disappeared. They faced to many obstacles that could not be overcome."	3	4		3																					
15056	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles trying to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. Lack of a suitable landing area was a tough obstacle. It is against the law for airships to fly low over urban areas. It would be dangling high above people and it wouldn't be safe. The way the dirigibles stays up in the air is it uses hydrogen instead of helium yet hydrogen is extremely flammable. To have a dock for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building it would not be safe and the builders would have to think of a new plan therefore, there would be many obstacles."	2	2		2																					
15063	6	"While the construction of the Empire State Building was in progress, the builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. At first, people thought it was going to be wonderful and lead to the ""transportation of the future"". One obstacle the builders faced was the fact that a large dirigible moored to the roof would have negative effects on the building's frame. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". The builders would have to pay @MONEY1 to fix this problem. Another problem that was present was also the lack of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Also, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the violent winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Even if the back of the dirigibles were weighted down with lead, it would not be safe; as the lead would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low above urban areas. Nature itself presented many more problems, such as winds blowing the dirigible onto the ""sharp spires of other buildings."" As numerous problems became apparent after the building was finished, the idea of dirigibles being the ""future of transportation"" was dropped."	4	4		4																					
15069	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with multiple obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although some of these obstacles were fixed early on, others were not brought to the builders' attentions until later on. The first obstacle that the builders encountered were the modifications that were needed to be done to the building's framework. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@CAPS1 nine). The Empire State Building would not have been able to support the mooring mast without having the essential modifications done. This process costed an extra sixty thousand dollars. The second obstacle that the builders faced had not even been brought up until after the building had been completed. The wind factor had made it nearly impossible to be able to dock any dirigibles. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). With all the pedestrians located on the ground, this factor made it extremely unsafe. The final obstacle that was faced was with the law. Under already existing law, airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas. Blimps docking at the mooring mast would be violating this law. The architectures and engineers of the Empire State Building clearly did not look into what was necessary to building the mooring mast."	4	4		4																					
15074	6	"In the excerpt there were a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The largest issue with allowing the dirigibles to use the building as a mooring site was safety. It mentions in paragraph @NUM1 that the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey. This brought on thoughts about it happening at the Empire State Building. If a dirigible caught fire while attached to the building there would be a high death rate due to New York City being so populated. Another obstacle would have been keeping the dirigibles from swiveling around the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the point that having lead weights away down the back of the ship would be quite dangerous with so many pedestrians on the street below. Yet another reason why trying to more the dirigibles to the building was not practical was because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). This made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building, let alone get close enough to try to. Tying all of these reasons together is the fact that the wind was too strong at the top of the building for anything to happen safely and without some sort of injury."	3	3		3																					
15077	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in atempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The bigest obstacle is to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his empire state building. One set of engineers and the government people in washington are figuring on some safe way of moooring airships to this mast. The greatest obstacle itself was mother nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to vilant air currents. These are some of the many obsticles of the Empire State building faced wile atempting to alow dirigibles to dock there.	2	2		2																					
15086	6	"There is a lot of obstacles in trying to come with an idea of a building. They had to make sure the structure of the building was capable of the high winds it was going to get.

15087	6	"In ""The Mooring Mask"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, In order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face obstacles. First, ""the lack of a suitable landing area"". They had to make room for the huge dirigibles to land. Second, ""add stress to the building's frame."" They had to make the structure of the building stronger so it wouldnt break. Lastly, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"" if they were going to be able to make this work they needed to find a way to calm the wind by the tower. Hence, In ""The Mooring Mask"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, in order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face obstacles."	2	3		3																					
15097	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted their were obstactes the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. One obstacle was the terrible winds. In the excerpt it states how bad the winds are. One dirigible was going to try to dock there was the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles couldn't get close enough because of the very strong winds. The Captain feared the wind would blow the dirigible into a sharp spire on one of the buildings in the area and puncture the dirigible's shell. Another reason was their was already a law that stated against airships flying to low over urban areas. This made it illegal for any dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach it. The last and final obstacle they faced was the fear of crashing. Since most blimps from out of the country used hydrogen rather than helium it was dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. They heard about the blimp fire in New Jersey they realize how much worse an accident like that would be on such a densely populated area like downtown New York City. And that is the obsacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The huge wind gusts. The Law. And don't forget what happens of the dirigible crashes in the area of New York City."	4	3		4																					
15100	6	"Although thousands of dollars and countless hours were spent on the Mooring Mast, certain obstacles prevented dirigibles from docking atop the Empire State Building for safety reasons. First, these dirigibles were not safe to fly over populated areas. Some contained the highly flammable gas hydrogen. Also, a German dirigible called the ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames in New Jersey. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The winds at the peak of the Empire State Building were violent. It is stated in paragraph four teen, ""The winds on top the building were constantly shifting.""

The first obstacle, framework, wasn't too hard overcome, it cost @MONEY1 to strengthen it in order to support the mast and a blimp. The second obstacle was safety, on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the highly flammable gas hydrogen which is used in dirigibles. This accedent could have been much worse if it occured above a highly populated area like New York. The third obstacle was @CAPS1 nature, the violent air currents on top of the Empire State Building made it close to impossible to dock a dirigible to the mast. By using led weights to weigh down the back of the blimp would be neither practical nor safe hanging high above pedestrians.

Trying to make New York the forefront of modern travel, the architects and builders of the Empire State building rushed to the challenge of building a mooring mast failling to recognize the obstacles that lay ahead. As the architects designed the mast they quickly realized the frame of the building was not equipped to handle the weight on top of its flat roof. Making those adjustments had cost builders more time and New York City more money. In addition workers had not considered wind currents. In this excerpt the writer says ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 workers should have considered possible obstacles before building something as big a project as a mooring mast."	3	2		3																					
15151	6	"Al Smith, four-term governor of New York and a leader of the Empire State Building's construction, had a vision. His vision was to create a two-hundred fifty foot mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, not only making it the world's tallest building, but also to dock passengers and deliver goods through the use of dirigibles or blimps. Unfortunately, there were many @CAPS1 facing the builders of the Empire State Building regarding the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast. The main concerns the builders faced were the materials that dirigibles are made out of, mother nature, and airship laws. The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced concerning the docking of dirigibles on its mast was the materials dirigibles are made from. According to the article, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... highly flammable..."" The builders realized this posed as a huge safety threat, especially over a densely populated city. The second obstacle the builders faced regarding the docking of dirigibles on its mast was mother nature herself. The article states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... neither practical nor @NUM1). The construction workers realized that having passengers moving on and off the mast, could be very dangerous in harsh weather conditions. The final obstacle the construction workers faced was an overlooked airship law. The story says, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" (@ORGANIZATION2). The workers realized that it was against the law to even tie up an airship to a building. In conclusion, the three main @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced in regards to the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast were the materials that dirigibles are made of, nature, and airship laws."	4	4		4

Then he came up with the idea of adding a top or a hat to the building.The idea Al Smith came up with was adding a landing spot for blimps or dirigibles. Al Smith knew it wasnt gonna be easy so he thought of possible reasons why it wouldnt work. He had to design another figure that would be able to hold the mass of the blimps. He also had to think about how passangers would get on and off the blimp. He also remembered most blimps use hydrogen instead of hellium which hydrogen is highly flammable. For example the German blimp hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lake hurst."	2	2		2																					
15158	6	"The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. To start off, there was a lack of suitable landing area.

Next, was figuring out a safe way of getting the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. This was another tough obstacle because if the mast was just placed on the top of the building, it would add stress to the building's Frame, which is dangerous. Lastly, and most importantly, was the problem of nature. At the top of the building there were constantly shifting wings due to violent air currents. This was an extremely dangerous obstacle because the winds could cause the dirigibles to be constantly moving and shaking. Also, if they were weighted down by lead weights to prevent them from being affected by the wind, the weights would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. To allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders @ORGANIZATION1 many different obstacles."	3	4		4

15191	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there, the most difficult of which were the urban location, money, and the weather. The urban location was an obstacle for the builders because there are laws against airships flying too low over a density populated area and you can't weight the airship down like you could if it was on the ground because the weights would be dangling over the city. The second obstacle was money because it was becoming increasingly expensive to pay for all of the modifications to make the mooring mast the reality. The third and most dangerous obstacle was the weather because wind and other various kinds of storms can control the airship and make it difficult for it to dock at the Empire State Building. Therefore, the obstacles of the urban location, money, and the weather made it virtually impossible for the mooring mast to be constructed."	3	3		3																					
15203	6	"In the excerpt from ""the mooring Mast""by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building. First, they risk having the dirigibles from places outside the U.S cause a fire. @ORGANIZATION1 states ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1. @NUM1). This would become a big issue because they will run the risk of having other dirigibles pass our highly densed air and cause a fire inadvertently. By building a loading dock they are potentially harming the area of downtown New York. Second another obstacle that would get in the way of building the dock is nature. Builders say ""The wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). Even if they attempt to tie down the dirigibles there is a chance that the back will move around. the idea that the winds would be too much to handle they brought up alternatives like lead weights, but it will become a hazard for pedestrians. Finally there was a law that prevented any airships to fly too low. The article reads ""This law would make it ilegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3). the law made it extremely hard for the builders. The overall idea was to make the airship to land on the building, and this obstacle made it a bigger problem. The idea of a dock vanished, it was too much of a risk to do it. Nevertheless the excerpt by @ORGANIZATION1, ""The Mooring Mast"", describes the challenges put upon builders to build a dock."	3	4		4

They thought to way down the rear of the ship, but soon realized that is unsafe over many people below. They had heard of a @CAPS2 in New Jersey was Destroyed by fire, Due to its hydrogen, Also unsafe in New York with such a @ORGANIZATION1 population.

15218	6	The architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into a few problems when searching for a way to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects knew they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on the @ORGANIZATION1 roof because it would be able to support it.

""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" (Lüsted. @NUM1) The frame of the Building would have to be modified to accommodate this new situation. The greatest reason why it was never fully constructed was Because of safety. Most dirigibles outside the U. S used hydrogen rather than helium. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... The owners realized how much worse have it been taking place above a densely populated area."" (Lüsted. @NUM2). This makes travel out side the @LOCATION1 with dirigibles more difficult.

So the builders needed to find a way to not ruin the foundation of the Empire State Building.

That wasnt the only obstacles money was one of the problems as well, ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" That's a lot of money that is being used just for a frame of a building. Safety was an obstacle as well, ""The greatest  rason was one of safety Most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" I think safety was the greatest obstacles they had, because what if a hydrogen dirigible was to blow up on top of the Empire Building. think of all the people that could get hurt because they dont call New York the city that never sleeps because people stay up at night in there house. They call it the city that never sleep's because it's alway's moving, there's alway's people on the streets and downtown New York is alway's full of people."	2	3		3																					
15272	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was the stress on the building's frame, the building required over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to fix this. Also the back end of the dirigible would swing freely in the strong wind, this is usualy fixed by attaching a lead weight to the back in the fields where they usualy land but dangling that over a city is a very dangerous. Anothe problem is the law stating no aircraft flying to low over urban areas. Finaly dirigibles never caught on. So the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles In their attemt to make a dirigible docking station."	3	3		3																					
15274	6	"By attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the obstacles that they faced was the re-desgning of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" that meant that they had to make modifications (over @MONEY1 worth). Another obstacle that they faced was that most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. And the greatest obstacle that the builders had was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Even if the Dirigible got parked, the winds would shake its tail too much and that wasnt safe."	3	3		3																					
15278	6	The builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. One problem is the docking a dirigible to the roof would add too much stress on the frame. Another is having all the flammable gases above a highly populated area. Also there was already a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. Lastly the wind constantly changing direction would make the ship to unstable.	2	2		2																					
15284	6	"The mooring mast was a failure from the start.  The builders and architects were not looking at the problems that would be present but only at how to build the most.  The first main problem the building workers faced when attempting to allow these dirigible's to land was actually building a mast atop the highest building in the world.  Then came the necessary modifications needed to improve upon the buildings framework to support the zepplins weight putting stress on the building after being pushed around by winds 1, 250 ft above the ground.  Perhaps the most important aspect of bringing these large zepplins over heavily crowded areas was safety.  The aspect of safety for pedestrians below would have been almost non-existent had the idea been carried out.  For example, some of those zepplins use hydrogen to stay a loft, and if a hydrogen filled blimp combusted over a city, it would seem pretty immenent people below would be harmed.  This project seems to present far too many obstables for these architects to overcome for docking a single blimp."	2	3		3																					
15285	6	"The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2 describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building was competing with the Chrysler Building in being the tallest building. Al Smith, the governor at that time, didn't want to be beat. Being the governor of New York, Smith added more floors to the building developing it into a dirigible dock.As time went on, the building ran into more problems. Tying a thousand-foot dirigable to the building, would add stress to the frame. ""The steal frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to be accomadate this new situation"" The frame around the building wasn't durable enough to hold a ""blimp"" The building would collapse while taking other buildings down. sixty-thousand dollars went into re-fining the frame but in the end, the building still failedAfter the frame was stable enough, more problems ocured. ""The greatest reason was one of safety Dirigibles used hydrogen, meaning it flammable."" Not only did the reason of safety of people went aganist the Building so did the law ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" once Al Smith realized even the law forbidded this, all plans that rose into action stoped, and the Empire State Building remained the same."	3	3		3

One of the obstacles the builders had was with the stress of the dirigibles load as said in the excerpt in paragraph @NUM1.             Another obstacle they had with landing the dirigibles to dock was that they had to modify and strengthened the steel frame of the Empire State Building.

One of the obstacles were that architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. This is because as it says on paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Another obstacles were making the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to fulfill its purpose. It was very hard to make the mooring mast fulfill its purpose because the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. In paragraph @NUM2 it states that, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""

That's what the Empire State building faced during its contraction."	0	1		1																					
15302	6	"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the safety of the city and dirigibles were a concern. In paragraph thirteen, it states ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". In addition, the greatest of obstacles was truly nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" As a dirigible attempted to succesfully use the mooring mast, the back end of the blimp would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". There additionally was a law which dated airships cannot fly that low over an urban area. Thus, the multiple obstacles which were faced through this ""architectural breakthrough"" destroyed any hope of the building's true purpose."	4	3		4																					
15303	6	"Constructing anything is always a difficult taksk, but trying to construct the worlds tallest building and have dirigibles being able to dock there is even harder. The workers who were modifing the Empire State Building had nemerous obstacles that stood in their way when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The obstacle they could not controll was nature herself. The winds were said to be ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" according to the excerpt wich made it difficult for dirigibles to dock there, and dangerous. Also another factor that was an obsticle for the constructors was the building itself. The structure of the building would have to be modified because the dirigible ""would add stress to the building's frame,"" so constructors wolud have to make the building support this tremendous stress. Another obsticle was safty because some dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which was extremely flamable and dangerous for the massive population on the ground. These are a few of the many obstacles faced when modifing the Empire State Building."	4	4		4

In building this mast there were many obstacles to overcome, but even with those obstacles it was still finished.The Mooring Mast was needed because without it the Empire State Building would not be the tallest in the world. To make the Mooring Mast work the builders had to overcome some obstacles. One of the main obstacles was to add on the Mast they would have to attach steal from the Mast all the way down to the foundation. Another was After designing the Mast they had to change the original plans for the building."	1	1		1

Some dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is, according to the article, ""highly flammable."" @CAPS1 a dirigible catch fire right over a very populated area would be dangerous. Nature was another factor. ""Violent air currents"" made it difficult to maneuver a dirigible and bring it close enough to the mast to dock. Yet even if these frustrating conditions were not extant, it would still have been impossible for a dirigible to moor on the mast, because it was illegal. A law prohibited ""airships [from] flying too low over urban areas,"" which included dirigibles.

Safety was the greatest reason to shut down the job. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the blimp, which would be over New York was to burst into flames many people would be killed. In conclusion, these obstacles are why the builder stopped and didn't complete the project for the Empire State Building."	3	3		3

15331	6	"Basically this excerpt is talking about the ""The Mooring Mast"". It is all about the construction. One of the obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced to is the safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This quote reveals that the dirigibles they made is highly flammable and it's dangerous for people's lifes.  Pretend that the dirigible is on fire while it's flying up high to sky, it causes lifes.     The other obstacle the builders faced to is that it against the law. ""The other reason practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Even though the building is the tallest building in New York. But it is still too low for the laws. Airship can not fly that low over the urban area, it causes accidents.         The Empire State Building is over 1,250 feet, which means on the top of the build has strong and forceful winds and the like dirigibles couldn't stop and get close to the top of the building.

15339	6	"Elders of the Empire State Building faced many complications Safety was a major concern.  Battling with the harsh winds would also be a problem.When the idea of the mast was created, not many realized the reality of the concept.  To put an extremely heavy object and attach it to just a tether, was not safe enough.  The combination of combustible gases also suggested pulling down town New York at risk.To land on such a small roof would be difficult due to strong winds.  Guiding the dirigible to such a delicate landing would prove to be hazardous with the strong winds.The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obsticles when constructing the mooring mast."	3	3		3

15347	6	"While designing and building the mooring mast atop the Empire State building, the engineers seem to have ignored some seemingly useful information. As with any vehicle in the air or at sea, wind is either your enemy, or your friend. The engineers should have taken into greater consideration that changing wind speeds and direction 1,250 feet in the air are huge threats. Your dirigible will have a hard time getting close enough to the mast to moor, never mind to stay steady enough for passengers to exit, and board safely. Also if the law itsself prevented you from floating your blimp at such low altitudes, then its game over. Why even bother if its illegal? Although it seems like a futuristic sci-fi, and not to mention downright cool way to land a blimp, to many things prevented the idea from prevailing."	2	2		2																					
15349	6	"The builders faced many obstacles while building the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. One thing was just simply the building would not have been strong enough to hold the dirigibles weight. Due to that fact that, they had to strengthen all the framework on the entire building. They had to put in sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to its framework. Also having the right equipment on the dirigibles served as a problem. The dirigibles didn't have the right docking tools to dock on this newly built mooring mast. The back of the dirigibles could also be swung back and forth when docked which also served as a issue When it came to docking. Another problem was most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which was highly flammable and they didn't want something that could easily catch fire near the building like that"	3	3		3																					
15358	6	"There were many different obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, an existing law made it so that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which meant that a dirigible could not tie up to the building or approach the area. Another problem was making the mast strong enough to support a dirigible. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This shows that improvements had to be made to the mast. One of the biggest problems of building the mast was the issue of the dirigibles being filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. The owners of the building remembered the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed by fire in 1937, and how much worse the accident would have been if it had taken place in a densely populated area."	4	3		4																					
15360	6	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted describes the building of the mast of the Empire State Building. The mast was originally added to add height to the thousand foot building. However Al Smith, one of the builders, wanted the mast to ""serve the higher calling"" of providing a docking station for dirigibles. This idea proved to be very challenging. First, the builders had to change the structure of the tower to make it strong enough to support the weight of the dirigible swaying in the wind. Lüsted writes, ""The stress of the dirigible's load... Would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" When the mast was finally built, the builders faced the problem of having the dirigibles ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" If one ever fell, hundreds of people will be killed. Finally, there was a law that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" By docking at the Empire State Building, the dirigibles would be breaking that law. Although it was a good idea, ""The Mooring Mast"" shows that it would not be possible for dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
15366	6	"many obstacles were taken while trying to get the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there. This was a long, hard and thought out process. Workers couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the building's roof. A one thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. It was being held by a single cable tether, which added stress to the buildings frame. The architects also had to build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building. Later on they realized dirigibles could not moor a the Empire State building. One reason being a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Architects went through many obstacles in building masts. "	2	2		2																					
15373	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous, but the main obstacles consisted of the danger that dirigibles posed, nature, and an existing law against letting airships fly too low over the suburban areas. According to the reading, the danger that dirigibles posed was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is considered highly flammable"". This danger was emphasized by the German dirigible Hindenburg when it was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Nature was also a great obstacle because of the ""winds on top of the building"" that ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Because of these winds, it was almost impossible to dock a dirigible on the mooring mast without it moving around crazily. The last obstacle, the law, ""would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Unless the law was revoked, the mooring mast would never be able to work. However, the obstacle that the builders faced when designing the actual mast itself were that ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened"" because ""the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to building's foundation"" which turned out to be ""over sixty thousand dollars worth modifications."""	3	4		4																					
15376	6	"The builders of the Empire States Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1, the author mentions that they had to consider the Hindenburg incident that took place on May 6, 1937, ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" says the author. They realized that the safety of the people has to come first in all scenarios. Also, another obstacle that Al Smith and the builders faced was docking the dirigible when people are down below. In paragraph @NUM2, The author says: ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 dirigibles are often docked in open fields, weights to hold down the back of the ship could be used safely. But above a highly populated area was out of the question because lead weights dangling high above pedestrians is a safety violation. The builders had many obstacles in designing the use of the mooring mast."	4	3		4																					
15379	6	"The builders from this excerpt faced quite a few challenges in trying to let dirigibles dock there. First off, the whole structure of the Empire State Building would need to be altered. Having a mooring mast atop the building with a dirigible attached would put great amounts of stress on the building's frame. The stainless steel in the structure's frame would need to be modified to be made stronger, however this is very costly. The excerpt says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another challenge the builders faced was trying to deal with existing laws that had already been in place. The government did not want aircrafts flying too low over buildings. The excerpt says, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" (paragraph @NUM2). The excerpt also says that this law would make it illegal for an aircraft to ever tie up to a building or even approach it."	3	3		3																					
15396	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", it is clear the architects were blind to the problems of the mast. Al Smith was becoming competitive to build the tallest building, and that was blinding him to potential risks. The people wanted to progress transportation of their time had not fully analized the future complications. In designing the mast, paragraph nine quotes, ""a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of a building... would add stress to the building's frame"". Even in early progression of the mast, it was clear this may not work. Two months later the building was reframed and the mast was added. May 6, 1937, owers of the building realized that if an accident like the destruction of 'Hindenburg' occurred atop the building, it would be devastation to happen above the densly populated Downtown New York (paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle, as said in paragraph @NUM2, is nature itself. Winds at such high elevations were often unpredictable and would be extremely dangerous to have a tethered dirigible to swivel around and around the mast. Therefore the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building never fufilled it's destiny, but is now a site tourists flock to. By the end of the 1930's, the idea of dirigibles as future transportation was replaced by airplanes."	3	3		3

The winds currents at the top of the building were sporadic, and that could be a huge problem the dirigibles trying to dock. However, the biggest obstacle that builders never realized, was that it was even illegal. The height of the empire State Building was too low for an aircraft of any sort dock on.

Another obstacle the architects would have to face is the wind speeds at that height. The constantly changing winds would make the blimp need to be tied down on the front and back.

Nature also posed a problem. Air currents could violently sway the dirigible, on top of the building. And finally, they could not attempt this because it illegal.

After already building a more secure building, the workers realized that, ""A densely populated area such as downtown New York"", wouldn't be the best place to be if there ever was a accident, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". Nature played a great part in a obstacle because it would always be unpredictable. The winds would also wip the backend of the dirigible so it would be unsafe and  unsturdy for passengers. These are some of the obstacles builders had to face while building the famous mooring mast."	2	2		2																					
15443	6	"Even though allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building sounds like a good idea, it wasnt. There are many obstacles that prevent it from happening. With ""a @DATE1 ft dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Also one of the greatest obstacles as the violent winds that constantly change due to violent air currents. Also, the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians on the street which isn't safe. The biggest obstacle was the fact that it's illegal for airships of flying low over urban areas which would also make it illegal for the dirigible to tie itself up to the building or even get close to it. This sounds like a great idea and a great way to get more tourists, but there are too many obstacles to make it realistic."	3	3		3																					
15449	6	"The Empire State Building faced many obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles are blimps. The first obstacle for the Empire State Building with just the size. The Empire State building was very competive with the Chrysler Building. Some oppinions were ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpast, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. There was also the obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. They added a mooring mast. There was many trials and tribulates making the Empire State building."	1	1		1																					
15451	6	"When building the Empire State Building, the architects and engineers faced many problems. The first problem was reconstructing the buildings framework. This had to be done in order for the building to be able to undergo great amounts of wind pressure and stress from the dirigible. The next problem the workers encountered was the wind currents. The wind was so strong at the tip of the building, if a dirigible were to be docked to the mooring mast, it would be rotating around it depending on the wind currents. The final problem the architects faced was a law against a dirigible's height. There was an already existing law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas. These obstacles were but some of the many faced by the building team of the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
15455	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems with their idea of docking dirigibles on the top of the empire state building. One major impediment was the laws based around aircrafts. one law @CAPS1 air crafts from flying too low over urban areas. another problem the builders faced was the safety risks to docking dirigibles. Dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, an extremely flamable gas, and after the accident with the German dirigible Hindenburg explosion the builders realized the risk of accidents. Mother nature @CAPS2 the largest obstacle through, the height of the Empire State Building causes high speed winds which would fling the end of any dirigible around the mooring like a rag doll. The builders then realized all the risks to docking dirigibles and abandoned the idea."	3	3		3																					
15458	6	"The engineers and constructors of the Empire State Building definitely faced some large and overwhelming complications when trying to build it to allow the dockings of dirigibles, or blimps. First off, from their original plan, right off the bat, they had to modify the building because they found the actual height of another building was taller. so they had to come up with something fast to fix that. Secondly, after the Hindenburg disaster, @LOCATION1 had realized how dangerous it was for zeppelins to fly over urban areas, so they put a law against it, so the whole idea was basically tossed. And to make matters worse, the violent gusts of air and updrafts wouldn't make docking on the Empire State Building very safe for passengers."	2	2		2																					
15460	6	"When constructing a mooring mast, @CAPS1 ran into many problems. Safety was the main problem/concern they ran into. Since most blimps outside of the @LOCATION1 were hydrogen not helium, they were very flammable. After Hindenburg blimp was destroyed by a fire, people in @CAPS1 feared that would happen by the empire state building. Another problem they ran into was the law. At that time, it was the law that you couldn't fly an airship that low over urban areas. When tested, some blimps couldnt get close enough because of the heavy winds. This made it impossible to tie blimps up and let people off It also made people fear that the wind would blow the blimp onto sharp parts of other building which would put a hole in the blimp It was a good idea, but there were just to many obstacles they had to go around to make the blimp docking station and mooring mast successful."	3	4		4																					
15461	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was the violent air currents that were at the top of the building. Even if the dirigibles successfully docked at the top of the building the back end of it would be thrashing around from the wind. If this happened and the blimp became uncontrollable it could crash into another building and fall to the ground where all the downtown New @CAPS1 walk. Putting weights on the end of the blimp would help that situation but as @CAPS2 says, ""dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Another issue the builders faced was the fact that dirigibles were highly flammable. They learned their lesson and got it into their heads that their idea might not be so good after when the German blimp, the Hindenburg, was destroyed. "	3	3		3																					
15464	6	"From the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2 we find that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles. Their first obstacle was to figure out how to transfer ""the stress of the dirigible's load and windpressurs"" to the buildings foundation. Another was to modify the steel frame of Building and strengthen it to accommodate the situation of adding the mooring mast. And so the builders did modify the building and assigned a mooring mast, but when construction was completed builder came upon another obstacle. ""most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, which is a danger if any would go up in flames above New York. The greatest obstacle with the winds. They were constantly shifting making it difficult for any dirigibles to even get close to the mast even if the could get to the mast the back of the dirigibles would swivel around the mast where in open fields dirigibles would be weighed down with lead weights. at the Empire state building they would be dangling higabove pedestrians, this was niether practical or safe. Because of all the obstacles the Mooring Mast would never be used"	4	4		4																					
15467	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, one of the obstacles they faced were that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is significant because it would be dangerous for foreign dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, especially in a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Another obstacle they faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due violent air currents."" This suggests that a dirigible would swivel around and around and they could be weighted down with lead weights, using these at the Empire State Building, high above pedestrians on the street, would be impractical and unsafe. Next, there was also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This is important because it is another obstacle that would ultimately make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Also, ""in December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" This shows that another obstacle they may have faced was losing confidence and directly observing that their plan would not work. The various obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there show that it would have been a difficult task to complete."	3	4		4																					
15471	6	"Although the builders tried hard to make their dream become a reality, there were a few obstacles that prevented that. The main obstacles builders faced were weather, the law, and safety concerns.The weather at the top of the building was very windy, and strong winds would cause major issues for the dirigibles landing. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem they faced was that there was a law effect preventing aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. Since New York is an urban area, no dirigibles would even be allowed to fly anywhere near the Empire State Building. The other main obstacle was a concern for safety. Hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, was used in many foreign dirigibles. It could cause a catastrophe if one ever exploded over New York, and there had already been an accident where ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937...""These obstacles were not just ones that the builders could ignore, and they ultimately prevented the intended use altogether."	3	3		3																					
15476	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obsticles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obsticle was the fact that dirigibles were dangerous when not handled correctly. If so, many people could die because it was within a densely populated area. In paragraph @NUM1, the author states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1 was also an issue in allowing dirigibles to dock there; the wind at that height was very forcefull, and would become a problem. In paragraph @NUM2, the author states in relation to the wind, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another obsticle was the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. Paragraph @NUM3 states, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even a produced area..."" @CAPS2, all of these obsticles made it impossible in the end for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."	4	3		4																					
15482	6	"In the article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the architects of the empire state building faced multiple obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First there was the obvious concern, safety, a dirigible dangling over New York City does not seem very safe. And it @CAPS1 wasn't a reasonable thing to build, the empire state building was already tall enough, why build a mast that probably won't get much use anyway."	1	1		1																					
15490	6	"Many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the architect could not simply drop a mooring on top of the building's Flat roof.

""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind Pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". In order to make it work they would use diffrent Steel. Another obstacle the builder @ORGANIZATION1 would be safety. Winds and hydrogen were main focuses. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, hydrogen is highly flammable, The winds on top of the building were. Constantly Shifting due to violent air currents.""

15500	6	"The builders have faced many obstacles, from laws to future disasters. There were several problems with the design and location of the mooring mast One problem was that ""the winds on top of the building, were constantly shifting."" Even though the architects adjusted the design of the mast, it was still too dangerous to land a blimp.Another major problem, was the dirigibles themselves They were filled with combustable hydrogen. If a blimp was to catch fire, like the Hindenburg, the debris would fall on the pedestrians' below. The last problem was a law that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas.""In conclusion, due to laws, the dirigibles and nature, the mooring mast was not used."	2	3		3																					
15502	6	"The architects who built the mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building had many problems with actually docking any dirigibles there. When they @CAPS1 building the idea of being able to dock blimps on the top of a building was revolutionary and ideal. But they had many issues with safety, weather and laws. One issue with safety was that the gas inside the dirigibles, hydrogen, is highly flammable. One accident could harm hundreds of people in New York's streets. The wind on top of the building was also very strong. Making it difficult for any blimp to get in close enough. the last difficulty  that the builders had was laws. There were certain laws not allowing air ships to fly too low over high populated urban areas. While their mooring mast seemed like a good idea to start out with, sadly it never got much use."	3	3		3																					
15515	6	"The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 outlines the problems architects had when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The idea was impractical, mainly because of safety reasons. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable. If an accident were to occur, the dirigible would crash into the thousands of pedestrians in New York City. Nature was another reason why this idea was impractical. In New York City, there was constantly shifting winds that swiveled the dirigible out of control, even when docked. Some dirigibles used lead weights to prevent the back from swiveling, but in New York City ""they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street... neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, air laws prevented the dirigible docks from becoming a reality. It was illegal for the dirigibles to even approach the area because of how low they would have to fly.

15523	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2. The builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to prohibit dirigibles to dock. The three main obstacles the builders faced were their concern was safety, nature itself, and the existing laws of airships. Safety is a major factor when constructing. The builders had the chance of using hydrogen rather than helium. Risking the fact of how highly flammable hydrogen is. Later realizing how bad it could of been if what happened to the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" on May 6, 1937. Could of happened to them taking place above a ""densely populated"" area like New York City. Nature itself was also an obstacle, because the winds on top were shifting constantly. This could potentially cause the back of the dirigible to ""swivel"" around, aswell around the mooring mast. The final obatoce was that of the ""existing laws against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" They feared that the winds would blow the dirigibles into sharp spires of other structures, and puncture the dirigible's shell. In two failed attemps they desided to cancel the construction of the ""Mooring Mast"" due to ""the unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height that made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."""	4	4		4

Another problem was the air currents, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" A final problem was a law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas.""

15529	6	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One obstacle being to much stress on the buildings frame.

The workers wanted to use hydrogen to keep the dirigibles afloat, but realized hydrogen is flamable. Other problems where nature and law. Nature's winds would complicate the dirigibles from staying still. Law stated that the dirigibles would be flying to low for urban areas. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that led to a plan failed."	3	3		3																					
15530	6	"Many years ago, people sought a new and more practical mode of transportation. Upon being introduced to the dirigible (or blimp), it was believed that this small aircraft could be the transportation of the future. Plans were made for a mast to be constructed atop the Empire State building located in New York City. The project was soon underway, but not without obstacles along the way. Hazards in nature, construction of the Empire State Building, and differences between American and @CAPS1 dirigibles hindered the success of the mooring mast.             It is a well-known fact that nature can be unpredictable and incredibly harsh. This makes all transportation, especially transportation by air, difficult and dangerous. In the construction of the mooring mast, violent wind currents were noted. It would be nearly impossible to allow a dirigible to dock atop the Empire State Building on a very windy day because only the front portion of the aircraft would be secure. This endangers pedestrians.       Secondly, it was noted that the Empire State Building's roof required improvements in order for dirigibles to dock there. Upon being secured by one cable tether, the weight of the dirigible would press on the building. This could potentially be hazardous, and cost about @MONEY1 to fix.            Lastly, dirigibles from other countries would not be able to fly to the United States. American dirigibles are filled with helium, which made it very light and easy to fly. @CAPS1 models used hydrogen, which happens to be incredibly flammable. After a German dirigible was damaged beyond repair by fire, it was determined that these models could not be used.             Ultimately, the dangers associated with using dirigibles for travel outweighed the benefits. It was determined that too many accidents could because by dirigibles, so the Empire State Building had to be used another way."	4	4		4																					
15540	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, she describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph Four it says, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This would mean that there was not much room for the dirigibles when it was not in year. In paragraph sixteen it says, ""The U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approach to the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"". This means that weather could make traveling dirigibles very dangerous."	2	1		2																					
15546	6	"The builders faced many problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building.  First of all, tying a dirigible with one cable would add tremendous weight to the frame of the building.  In order for this to be possible, the steel frame of the Empire state building would have to be strengthened which would add an additional cost of @MONEY1.  After the mast was built, the Empire state building faced new problems as well.  Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable.  After what happened to the Hindenburg, the architects knew that the results would have been much worse in a densely populated area such as New York City.  Another problem was that it was too risky to have a big dirigible hanging above pedestrians a few thousand feet in the air.  The law also hindered Al Smith's idea.  The law stated that airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas.  When the dirigible Los Angeles attempted a trial, builders found that the wind blew too high for the dirigible and they feared it would fly into nearby buildings.  The idea of dirigibles was soon forgotten and gave way to airplanes."	3	3		3																					
15548	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest one being violent winds so high up.

They couldn't use lead weights to hold it in place, because it wouldn't be safe to have them dangling above the streets. There was, at the time, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, for simelar reasons. This would have made it illegal for a zeppelin to dock there anyway. These are some obvious problems, overlooked in the design of the mooring mast."	3	3		3																					
15549	6	"In the nonfiction excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the architects faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" This quote is saying that they needed to build a mooring mass to overcome the obstacle. The second obstacle they faced was the architects couldnt just drop a mooring mass on top of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable wether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" This quote is saying the stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted and the still frame of the building would have to modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. The third obstacle which was the greatest obstacle was the successful use of the mooring mast. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote is saying the nature of the mooring mass itself was dangerous because the back of the ship would swevel around the mooring mass. This made the mass unsafe.

Then the builders ran into a problem with safety, the winds on top of the building were violent and constantly shifting. This would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast. They the decided to add lead weights to weigh the dirigible down but, having those dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe.

They had to make many adjustments to the building's framework, the safety of the dirigibles was dangerous, and nature itself posed as a huge obstacle for the builders.First, the architects realized that they could not drop a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building because of the stress it would add to the building's framework. As Lüsted states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" The architects then had to make adjustments which would strengthen the building to allow the docking of the dirigibles. These improvements cost the architects @MONEY1!The second obstacle faced by the builders was the safety of the dirigibles. At the time most of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which was highly flammable. The architects saw how dangerous this could be when they witnessed the destruction of the German Hindenburg blimp. If the same thing was to happening in New York, which is a densely populated area, it could cause serious damage.Another obstacle the builders faced when trying to dock the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting which would cause the blimp to be very unstable. The blimp is usually weighted down by lead weights but in New York this would not be safe he cause they would be dangling above pedestrians.

Some of these obstacles included the fact that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for a ship to be tied to the building because it would be illegal. Also, in line three of paragraph thirteen, it is stated that it would have been unsafe because many dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen, being very flammable would put people not only inside of the dirigibles, but everyone near and around it, in great danger. Another obstacle mentioned in the excerpt, perhaps the largest one, was the violent air currents causing wind at the top of the building to always be shifting, making it nearly impossible and unsafe for them to land there.

Another great concern was safety, they feared an accident similar to the Hindenburg and thought of ""how much worse the accident could have been (paragraph @NUM1) if it had occurred in a city like New York. The greatest obstacle they faced however was nature.

15573	6	"When the Empire State Building was being constructed, the main idea was to create a mooring mast for dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. However, being the first of its kind, this idea came with many obstacles. Before constructing the mast, they had to stabilize the building with steel framework and other modifications as stated in paragraph nine. Dirigibles are very long, and the previous structure would not be enough to support it with the high blowing winds. Safety was also an issue with adding the mooring mast. Blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, instead of helium. If something were to happen, and the blimp caught fire, that could threaten the safety of cilvians. After the mast was constructed, the high speed winds were an obstacle yet again, and they wouldn't even allow dirigibles to come close to the building. Despite how unique the idea of letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building was, there were many obstacles getting in the way of making the idea successful."	3	3		3

His first obstacle was the threat of title for worlds tallest building being taken away by the Chrysler Building. When the architect added a 185 foot spiral to the top of the building. Al Smith had to come up with an innovative way to add height to the building. This is when the idea of adding a mooring mast to the top of the building was composed and the real problems arose. When building this mooring mast, the docking of dirigibles would add intense stress to the framework of the building. ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.

The wind was vicious at @NUM1 ft in the Air. Another problem the buiders faced with saftey. Since most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium it was A fire saftey issue. This occurred After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a Fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, ON may 6, 1937."	2	2		2																					
15587	6	"In the excerpt from @ORGANIZATION2's The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. For example, ""the lack of a suitable landing area."" Architects cannot just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's roof. The building would have had an extreme amount of pressure on it. In addition, along with the pressure, the dirigibles would ""add stress to the building's frame."" The builders needed to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building. This also cost a great deal of money. Furthermore, ""the greatest reason was safety."" The slightest mistake in building the mast, could affect every person in the building. In order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders needed to be aware of all the citizens surrounding the building. All in all, these obstacles determined the fate of the mast."	3	2		3																					
15594	6	Based on excerpt there were a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the obstacles were that there was a lack of suitable landing area. The second obstacle was that in order to have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building they would have to spend sixty thousand dollars just to accommodate the new station. Another obstacle being dirigibles could not moor or at the Empire State Building due to the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. There is three obstacles that made it hard for dirigibles to take over the future. That is why we now have air planes.	3	3		3																					
15618	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are that dirigible use different gases to stay aloft. As stated in paragraph 6, The first obstacle the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building is ""To their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" From paragraph @NUM1 it states that if a mooring mast was to be droped to the roof of the building and a single cable tether would add stress to the building and pressure would cause them having to modify the building and framework, which cost over sixty thousand dollars. In other words most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Also from paragraph @NUM2 the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds would cause constantly shifting from air current. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."	2	3		3																					
15622	6	"When designing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles, the builders came across a few obstacles. A dirigible is a blimp filled with hydrogen and/or helium to keep it lightly in the air. What the builders did not realize ahead of time was that hydrogen is a highly flammable gas. If it is docked on top of a building around movement it could easily catch on fire creating the whole building itself to blow up. Another obstacle that the builders noticed would occurred was the forceful winds. With a dirigible dock so high up in the air, it creates an unstable way for people to get off of it. The vicious winds would make the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast because only the front would be weighed down. The last obstacle that was found with docking a dirigible, was that it would be too low to an urban area. The dirigible would be too close to walking pedestrians, creating an un-safe enviroment if something was too go wrong. Without taking that chance, it was agreed that there were too many obstacles; therefore, the idea of docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building was cancelled."	3	3		3																					
15626	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building where faced with some obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. Saftey was the main focus because New York is a densly populated area and many dirigibles where filled with highly flameable hydrogen.One problem was that the builders relized the dirigible would be hanging by a single cable teather wich would add stress to the frame so they would need to adjust the building and strengthen the the frame. This costed over sixty thousand dollars to adjust. After that was taken care of the builders still had other problems.Another problem the builders faced was that since the building was in a highly populated area many pedestrians walk, below where the dirigibles would be docked. The winds at the top would cause the dirigible to blow around and lead weights could not be used because of the dangers of them falling"	3	3		3

Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that could have been noticed before building."	3	3		3																					
15699	6	"The biggest and most obvious obstacles of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were the factors of safety, nature and the city's law concerning low-flying airships. According to the article The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1 the greatest safety risk was that most blimps made/operated outside the U.S ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM1) @CAPS1 a hydrogen filled dirigible to float above densely populated @ORGANIZATION2 would have been to dangerous of a risk. In 1937 a hydrogen blimp did catch fire, and the outcome was disastrous; owners of the Empire State knew another accident like that above New York would have been much worse. In higher altitudes winds increase, and the winds atop the Empire State would cause the blimp's tail end to spend about. Normally the tail end would be weighted down, but weights hanging above the city isn't safe either. During one of the two failed attempt: at docking of the building the winds were too fierce for the dirigible to even get close to the building. The capitan of the blimp feared ""... that the wind would blow with the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area..."" (paragraph @NUM2) and that could put a hole in the blimp. Lastly, a law in New York City states that airships can't fly below a specific altitude, thus making the docking of a dirigible on top of the Empire State illegal. Many apparent obstacles were over looked in the planning of the Empire State Building's blimp dock."	4	4		4																					
15703	6	"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the architects faced many obstacles. Usually, when given an obstacle, you either succeed it or fail it. In this case, these men didn't overcome the obstacle.In the reading, it mentioned that dirigibles from outside the U. S. contained hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and it could cause a lot of damage. Not only to the building itself, but the area of downtown New York as well. Winds at the top of the building were shifting due to air currents. This could cause the dirigibles to circle the mast when even tied down. The architects also had to think about the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The builders didn't realize how complicated the process of even tying down a dirigible would be because of the high winds. Even the process of dropping off newspapers was difficult, and took up too much time. Who would want in enormous steel framed balloons dangling over them anyways?"	4	3		4																					
15705	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first initial issue that they faced was the stress the blimp would put on the building As the article states here, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation...the building would have to be modified and strengthened to  accomodate the situation."", the stress prompted the need for further improvements on the building itself; which obviously costs time and money. Another problem they faced was the impracticality of the dirigibles themselves. The dirigibles require hydrogen, which is highly flammable. As a result of the Hindenburg disaster, ""the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident would have been over a densely populated area such as downtown @LOCATION1"" Another great issue that presented itself was the inconsistent violent air currents, which made safe docking for the blimps difficult. This problem could be combated with lead weights, but they ""were neither practical nor safe."" And lastly, there was already ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law prevented the blimps from being able to fly as low as the building, let alone land there. In conclusion, the builders of the mooring mast at the @CAPS1.S.B. faced many obstacles in its construction which questioned its safety and prevented it from being practical."	4	4		4																					
15712	6	"There were three main reasons as to why the Empire State Building would not serve well as a mooring mast for the dirigibles. For one, it was unsafe. Most of dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was to great. Especially over a highly populated city. Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. These three obstacles were all contributing factors as to why the Empire State Building could not serve as a dirigible mooring mast."	3	4		4																					
15713	6	"Marcia Amidon Lüsted, in her excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigables to dock there. One obstacle they would have to faced was realized during the designing of the mast that would be put on top of the building for docking. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" (¶ @NUM1) They found that a dirigible docked on top of the building would add too much stress to the building's fram. Therefore, their first obstacle was to make modifications that would strengthen the building's framework. However, as Lüsted points out in paragraph @NUM2, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to rough air currents at the top of the building, the winds would constantly be shifting making even a dirigible tethered to the mast sway around. Another issue was the question of how to weight the dirigables down. In open landing fields, they would weight dirigables down with lead weights. Using extremely heavy weights while being above hundreds of people on the streets would not be acceptable. In conclusion, as one can see, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigables to dock there."	3	3		3																					
15716	6	"The main problem they had with the docking of the dirigibles was it would have to be really safe. To hold the aircraft down they would have to use lead weights. I weights fell from the top of the building in such a dense, populated area it would be very dangerous. Also when the owners of the Empire State got notice of the hindenburg blowing up they felt uneasy. Even if the aircraft was floating moored to the top of the building the wind would whip it around making it even more unsafe. The idea was good but not probable to be safe."	2	2		2

For example the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building flat roof.

15718	6	"There were many issues that made it impossible to use the Mast of the Empire State Building as a dock for dirigibles. One was that many foreign dirigibles were filled with hydrogen a very flammable gas. If one caught fire like the Hindenburg, it would cause many trageties because it would be above people's homes. For the same reason, there was  a law against dirigibles flying too low over cities.""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""@CAPS1 the safety risks for people below, there was the wind causing a problem that the blimp could not even dock correctly. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship with swivel around."" One of the attempts proved that it would be tricky to land. The Los Angeles attempted to reach the building, but retired the thought because of the wind.

15723	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced two obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the forceful winds. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even tethering the dirigible to the mooring mast would cause the back of the ship to swivel dangerously around the mooring mast. The second obstacle was due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

15730	6	"Mooring mast was added to the top of the building where it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off.

Next it said a thousand foot drop would add stress to the frame and last they had to change the frame from steel to glass and they also had to change the roof.

The architects had to upgrade the frame so it was safe. Now that the frame was safe they had to worry about the dirigible itself. If only one end of the dirigible was tied to the mast the other end would blow in the wind. This would make unloding cargo and people very hard. Also dirigibles could catch fire, which wasn't safe. for the people on the ground. In the and it just wasn't safe to dock a dirigible at the Empire State Building."	2	3		3

The first sign of hope shinned apon Al when he saw an opportunity for Empire State Building. Dirigibles needed a landing area. and the mooring mast does the trick. The mast, added to the top of the building, allows dirigibles to anchor For awhile to refuel and to have service done. This design took a while to develop + soon became bad. Saftey was a factor. Most dirigibles, from outside of the @LOCATION2. were run on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and can cause tragic accedents. For example on May 6, 1937 German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. If something like that would happen in a heavily populated area like @CAPS1 then there would be a problem. These were a couple of the many obstacles faced while building the Empire State Building."	2	2		2																					
15748	6	"The obstacles the builders faced was mainly safety. Safety was important because of how many people there are in New York. Another problem was the dirigibles outside the United States were hydrogen instead of helium.

A blimp can easily be blown into a close building's sharp spires and pop because of winds. There are alot of things that could go wrong at any time, so I think the right decision was to stop the idea of the mooring mast."	2	2		2

Due to these currents, it became very hard to be able to allow a dirigible to dock at the top of the empire state building, without blowing away. Another obstacle was safety. The dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, instead of helium. Hydrogen is a very flammable object and if an accident were to happen, a flaming balloon flying over a highly populated area of New York could become very dangerous.

15767	6	"Obstacles such as nature, safety issues, and weight as well as length of the dirigible were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. They were very hopeful in the idea of having the Empire State building, ""equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers,"" until they saw the risks. First was nature itself, winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This means that the dirigible, which was made to be, ""lighter than air,"" would swivel around the mooring mass. and have no weight support to keep it down. Sometimes, the winds might even prevent the dirigible to get close enough like in @DATE1 when a U.S. Navy dirigible named Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but couldn't get close enough. Another issue with safety. It was stated that outside of the U.S., most dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium, which was used in the U.S. Hydrogen is highly flammable which is a very dangerous asset when there are millions of people down below. When the owners of the Empire State Building heard about the German dirigible the Hindenburg that was destroyed by fire, they imagined that situation over New York which was highly populated. Lastly was the size and weight of the dirigible itself. The dirigible (@NUM1 ft) held by single cable would add stress to the building's frame. In order to prevent this, they would have to modify the frame. These obstacles plus many more showed that that this idea was, ""destined to never fulfill its purpose."""	3	4		4

For an example ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" In conclusion that is one way how they faced the obstacles.In another way how the obstacles and builders of the Empire State Building faced to attemting to all dirigibles to dock there is by transportation. In my own opinion transportation allows people to go to one place to another, For an a example ""By the @DATE1's dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future.

15873	6	"While building the mast for dirigibles to be able to dock their, the architects neglected to see many flaws that were waiting to happen. First off it was against the law to have air craft fly that low to the ground. Most of the dirigibles were mainly composed of hydrogen, which is highly flammable, so having that fly above a heavily populated area would not be to safe. The wind currents at the top of the building were also very strong, therefore the dirigible could be pushed into the side of a building and get punctured by a sharp object. In conclusion the entire idea of having dirigibles landing on the empire state building was an accident waiting to happen."	3	3		3																					
15880	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there such as safety, weather, and policies. One of most obvious issues was the safety of the docking. Blimps run on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If something were to happen while refueling the dirigible, it could potentially cause extreme harm to the densely populated area underneath it. Another stumping factor was the weather at such high altitudes. At 1,250 feet above the ground, the wind is constantly changing directions because of the ""violent air currents"" so high up. Also, it proved to be difficult to tie the blimp because since the winds were so strong, the dirigible could not get close enough to the building. One last obstacle that was apparent was the law that was made stating that airships could not fly low over urban areas. This made the mooring dock illegal if used and made captains of the blimps aware that being so low and close to many buildings makes it challenging and dangerous to dock the dirigibles."	3	3		3

This obstacle would could cause the whole building structure to collapse which could cause death and alot of destruction. Another obstacle included nature. The excerpt states in paragraph fourteen ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These violent air current could cause the dirigibles to lose control and hit the building and other buildings around it. The stress being added to the Empire State building and nature itself were the two main obstacles for the builders."	3	3		3

If it couldn't fly up to the mast and dock there was no purpose in the mast or dirigibles. If they were to be able to dock they would need to be weighted down by lead weights. The problem with the weights was they would dangle above pedestrians. That was ""neither practical nor safe"" for the pedestrians on the street. If the dirigible docked at the top of the building, they would be held by a single cable. All the pressure on the cable would stress out the buildings frame. If that were to happen they would then have to strengthen and modify the buildings foundation. Overall the major obstacle they faced was not thinking through their plan of the dirigible. If they had thought it through these obstacles could have been prevented."	3	3		3																					
15890	6	"When the builders of the Empire state Building were constructing the mooring mast for the dirigibles, they faced obsticles that could have jeopardized the project. There were two aspects that the builders had to pay extra attention to, structural integrity, and design. Since ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Building's flat roof,"" The builders had to modify the building's frame. These modifications cost over @MONEY1. The other aspect that posed an obsticle was design. The architect, John Tauranac, described the plan to make the mast ""more than ornamental,"" and ""more than something as mundane as a water tank. So, to fufill the architect's high aspirations, the builders constructed a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside.

They realized the complications it would imply if there were to be an incident like the one in New Jersey. Also, nature was an obstacle to the project; ""The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). Consequently, due to the winds, the back of the dirigible would be swinging around the mooring mast, which would be a huge danger to the streets. As a final point, dirigibles wouldn't be able to moor at the Empire State Building because there was a pre-existing law concerning how low airships could fly over urban areas."	3	3		3

""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 is writing about the wind.

These wins caused the dirigibles tail end to move around while docked, causing unsafe landings and take-offsAnother obstacle faced was a law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas. This was feared because of the Hindenburg crash in 1937. The building officials feared if that crash were to happen in New York then the damage would have been catastrophic.

The last obstacles the builders had to get around was the issue with safety. Most dirigibles used either helium or hydrogen, both highly flammable gases. When the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the builders realized how dangers that could be over a populated area. These are just some of the many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to take into consideration when attempting to allow dirigible to dock their."	4	3		4																					
16024	6	"Many problems faced the construction workers of the Empire State building, @CAPS1 in allowing dirigibles to dock. To begin, construction for dirigibles on the Empire State building was dangerouse. Dirigibles couldn't do many basic things to dock at the building. For example ""dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) Mooring was impossible because it was against ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) This made it illegal for a ship to tie to the Empire State Building. Also, the greatest threat to dirigibles was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS2 @NUM3) Because of this and be fact that construction on such a high building at the time was unpractable, dirigibles never touched the Empire State building. So to close, the difficulty of building dirigible landing gear and of landing dirigibles ultimately ened the Empire State Building docks."	3	3		3																					
16025	6	"In their attempt to build a docking mast on the top of the Empire State Building, the builders came up on structural, safety, and practicality obstacles. In order to have the mast on top of the building the builders had to strengthen the steel, ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"". Also, they had safety concerns about letting a dirigible dock in a city, on a skyscraper. One of these concerns was the use of the flamable gas hydrogen that was used in non-American dirigibles. If a dirigible caught fire over the city the effects of it would be bad. Furthermore, the tether system of the mooring mast was at the will of nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, this meant the dirigible on the mast could then swivel around, making it danger to citizens. The mast was also in-practical, due to a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas. And finally, in later years dirigibles had ""given way to airplanes,"" thus making the mooring mast for dirigibles useless. The builders of the Empire State Building never succeeded in their attempt of putting an active mooring mast on top of the building, because of structural, safety, and practicality obstacles that they stumbled upon."	3	4		4																					
16027	6	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced a few problems. First, they had to figure out a practical way this could be done. When they decided to construct a ""rocket-shaped mast"" that the dirigible could attach to, they realized that the roof had to be built first. After the building of the mast was completed, saftey became an issue. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM1) If there were ever an accident with a foreign dirigible, the safety of New York City would be at risk. Also, the dirigibles could not be tied down with weights like they can in an open field. This would also be unsafe for the people of New York. The main obstacle the builders faced with saftey, which is a big issue. Therefore, the dirigibles could not dock on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
16036	6	"The obstacles the builders of the empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. Also A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. To do that they would need a lot of money like sixty thousand dollars.Another reason was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. But the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."	3	2		3																					
16046	6	"Governer Al Smith of New York had a vision. He wanted to have a building constructed that would surpass the current tallest building in the world, The Chrysler Building. He succeeded in doing so. The Empire State Building was now the tallest building in the world at 1,250 feet. But there were more plans for this building. At the time, aviation pioneers had dreamed of travel by dirigible, and now a mooring mast was to be built at the top of the building for docking these airships. But what should have been a cautious project, turned out to be a dangerous one. There should have been a lot more precaution going into this project. Dirigibles could be very dangerous in a widely populated area like New York City. If the dirigible were to catch fire and explode, people could get hurt. And at such a high altitude, it is likely. People were just starting to understand the dangers of this project halfway into it, which is why it was called off do to lack of safety."	1	1		1																					
16048	6	"The Empire State Building was always very famous and well-known, but did want more attention. Governor of New York, Al Smith, tried to allow dirigibles to dock on the building for transportation. He was encouraged it would work and actually went through with building it. The builders went through many obstacles trying to make it possible.To make this dream possible the builders would have to modify and strengthen the building. This would not be cheap, ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" It would be very expensive. The builders designed a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower."" Also the mast would have four wings of all all corners. The builders designed observation areas and even elevators and baggage areas. They had it all planned out and raised an American flag at the top. Unfortunately, nobody considered all the dangers of docking dirigibles. All the builders work never went through. They tried to dock two but it did not work out. The building turned into the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for sightseers."	1	2		1																					
16051	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the weight of the dirigible ""or blimp"", lust wind pressure, caused too much stress on the building's frame. The architects easily overcame this obstacle. They strengthened to iron frame of the building so it could withstand the added stress. Unfortunately, the other obstacles were not overcome, and led to the abandonment of the use of the mast for docking dirigibles. The biggest problem a safety. Many blimps used hydrogen rather than helium to keep it afloat, which is highly flammable. There was too much of a risk of the blimp catching fire and falling onto the city. Nature was also an enormous obstacle. Wind would blow the blimp into surrounding buildings, and since it was floating in the air, weights couldn't keep it down. Finally, there was an existing law stating aircraft could not fly too low around urban areas."	3	4		4																					
16056	6	"Architects and builders faced several obstacles when attempting to build the empire state building and allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was S keeping a safe environment. Dirigibles that are fueled by hydrogen are prone to be destroyed by fire. One example of this is in paragraph @NUM1, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" Another major obstacle was high wind speeds and violent air currents. These made dangerous because the back of the ship would be swung around the mooring mast. Lastly, another obstacle that they faced was a law. In paragraph @NUM2, it says, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would keep dirigibles from being able to ever dock there or even fly in the general area. All of these obstacles could not be overcome so in the end the mooring mast was not successful."	3	3		3																					
16066	6	"The task of allowing dirigibles to dock on The Empire State Building was met with many obstacles. The fist one to come into play was the support of the building. The dirigible's load and the wind pressure would greatly reduse the stability of the building. Over sixty thousand dollars' went into modifications of the building's framework.Another problem was the dirigibles themselfs. Most dirigibles coming from outside of the United States were filled with hydrogen. As seen in the tragic Hindenburg inncodent, hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building concluded that an accadent such as this would be even more devastaing over a densly populated area. After being faced with all these obstacles, the idea of dirigibles docking atop the Empire State Building was put to rest for the safety of the people."	2	3		3																					
16069	6	"The fact that these dirigibles are so big and filled with hydrogen and helium the point at the top would have poped it. Also the Winds were always too high so they would never be able to connect the blimp to the building. Lastly the fact that the German dirigible, Hindenburg burned like that they were afraid for that to happen. Especially in a crowded area such as New York."	2	2		2																					
16070	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many problems when attempting to make a mooring mast for Dirigibles. The frist major problem they came across was the biulding its self. It said ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the biuldings foundation."" The biulding being the tallest in the world could not take the pressure. They could possible made it strong but at high cost to something so @CAPS1 already. The architects next obstienle was saftey expessally in a highly populated area such as down town New York. They found the Dirigibles to be to dangerous and uncontroble in a city of towers. The normal processes of docking a Dirigible would have to complete change to acumulate. the mooring mast, soon laws were given to have airships stay away from areas of popurtion after the Hindenburg insodent. Yet some still dared to try and dock at the mast such as the Los Angeles and Columbia but the mast was never put to good use and shows the Problems with inovating things already @CAPS1 as the Empire State building."	3	3		3																					
16073	6	"After reading excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to dock dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. Firstly, the lack of a suitable landing area. The builders knew they had to add a mooring mast to the top of it so it could safely land and passengers could board and exit off. Another problem they faced was placing a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building, which would at stress to the buildings frame. This pressure along with the wind pressure would have to be converted all the way to the buildings foundation. Lastly, the biggest obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents, allowing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Although was a bright idea to improve transportation, this product never worked and was not thought out properly."	2	3		3																					
16088	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on its mooring mast. The first obstacle they had was the extreme winds. The winds were constantly shifting, so the dirigibles would be violently blowing through the air. Another obstacle was that the foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, instead of helium, which is extremely flammable. The last obstacle the builders faced was the law that it did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. The builders of the Empire State Building dealt with a number of reasons when they attempted to dock dirigibles on the building's mast."	2	3		3																					
16089	6	"Many obstacles were confronted when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. Such as the danger of the non-U.S dirigibles docking. The problem with that is they used hydrogen instead of helium, causing them to be highly flammable. They thought about when the German dirigible crashed and realized how much worse it would be if it happened in downtown New York. Another issue being nature's wind force. The wind on top of the Empire State Building was always aggresively shifting. Plus using lead weights like they do when landing in the fields would be hazard for the people below. Finally the law was a issue. The law stated that it was illegal to fly this low over urban areas. Though two dirigibles attempted they both experienced first hand the dangers of it."	3	3		3																					
16092	6	"To start off, the builders of the Empire State Building had faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Many of the obstacles had delt with the dirigible itself. For example, the dirigible was highly unsafe and flammable by the 1930s. ""When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937 realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York."" Another obstacle that the builders had faced was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. It would be highley dangerous for a dirigible to fly that close to a mooring mast with winds like that. Also, dirigibles could not fly near the Empire State Building, due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or approach the area. Al Smith's dream was to make the Empire State Building suitable for transportation, but sometimes dreams don't always go threw."	4	4		4																					
16109	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were comprehended to late. First they had to figure out a way to go about this, but they also needed government officials to agree that it's a safe way to execute Al's plan. The roof couldn't be flat, so they had to create something else for it to land on. But the dirigible being held on by one cable ""would add stress to the buildings frame"" and would be sent down all the way to it's foundation, which means they would have to modify their model of what the Empire State building was going to be. But one of the worst obstacles the builders had to face was the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable. And their are many people and other building in @CAPS1 that could be put in danger. Also the weather takes a toll on how the dirigibles going to act in the air, if it's rough it could cause major safety problems. There was and has been a law restricting airships from ""flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2 much, this idea was over from the start, but no one took the time to realize."	2	4		3																					
16111	6	"Based on the exerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is as follows. The first challenge was to find ""a practical, workable arrangement"" for the engineers to be able to work well and safely. Another problem the builders faced was how to put a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored"" into a building that was 1,046 feet tall. The main obsticle they faced was the fact that the dirigible moored ""would add stress to the building's frame"" which may cause it to fall due to its weight. For the builders to overcome the challenge, they would have to modify and give more strength to the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building."" @CAPS1, the builders went through a lot of obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, but in the end it was all worth their hard work to make Al Smith keep his winning title."	2	2		2																					
16112	6	"When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced obstacles regarding laws, safety, and even the nature of the mast itself. There was a law at the time prohibiting aircraft from flying low over cities. In paragraph @NUM1, the narrator says, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". This did not stop some dirigibles from attempting it, but it was too dangerous around other buildings. The next obstacle was about safety. From the excerpt, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammible"". An incident like that with the Hindenburg over a city like New York would be devastating. The third obstacle was that the mast was simply not suited for holding a dirigible. The narrator points out, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". There was no practical way to hold the back end of the dirigible. In light of all these issues, builders were forced to admit that the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was indeed destined to fail."	3	2		3																					
16114	6	"While dirigibles were being invented in the early 1930's. Many workers and financial men and women faced problems when trying to dock dirigibles. A dirigible was a live propeller that passengers who boarded the dirigible could ride. It was a closed compartment under the balloon. Getting back to the point of these inventions. Dirigibles were a dangerous device from what the passage says. From outside the United states they used hydrogen, not helium. The cause affect in using hydrogen is that it is highly flammable. The German dirigible... named Hindenburg, exploded by the cause of fire on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Dirigibles was a very dangerous device back used in the 1930's. So then by the late 1930's, the idea of wing transportational diribles faded away. Later on they took passengers baggage of dirigible and made it into the world's largest soda fountain and tea garden."	1	1		1																					
16122	6	"Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the law, and the spires that were on other buildings. Another problem was making the mooring mast. this was a problem because it whould add alot of stress to the building, And safety was an issue. I said that the law restricted this Because you can't Put a Blimp over urban areas because if some thing goes wrong alot of pedestrians will be killed. Putting up the mooring mast was no easy task it was very hard to make it to support a Blimp Because there will be to much pressure on the building. lastly safety there were Blimps that caught fire because of the gases they worked with. If that were to happen in New York alot of innocent lives will be gone."	3	3		3																					
16128	6	"Based on the excerpt, there were a few main obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. It would add unwanted stress to the building frame. Another issue was the gas used to fill the dirigibles. Hydrogen, being very flamable, could cause a dangerous fire above a densley populated area, downtown New York. Towards the top of the building, violent air currents caused another problem. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast. A final delema was an existing law that prohibited airships flying to low over urban areas, such as New York. Due to these obsticles, the ability to dock a dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building was destined to @CAPS1."	4	3		4																					
16129	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems trying to make dirigibles able to dock there. One problem was that the blimps use hydrogen instead of helium to fly. ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The blimps were unable to be used because they were a major safety issue for the people being transported. Another obstacle was that the air currents were very rough at the top of the Empire State building. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring asked, the back of the ship which swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dirigibles are usually put down in open fields with the back ends can be put down with lead weights; the blimps dangling high above pedestrians was nether practical nor safe. The builders for the empire state building faced many obstacles."	2	3		3																					
16133	6	"There were many obstacles builders needed to face to make it possible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First was the stress that would be put on the entire building if a dirigible was attached to a mast at the top. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way through to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (@NUM1) This problem was easily solved by strengthening the frame of the building. Another major problem was the wind 1,250 feet in the air the wind blows very hard and violently. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@NUM2) The wind combined with the fact that a dirigible was filled with hydrogen made a bad combination. Hyrogen is a very combustible gas and if a dirigible ran into the building and there was a spark the entire mass of the ship would be enflamed."	3	3		3																					
16134	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there was the height of the building. For instance in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified, over six thousand dollars worth of modifications"" This proves that the height of the empire was its height because the city had to pay modification fees. Also, because the building is so tall the mast is not that stable so that was the main obstacle stated in paragraph @NUM2 ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" This demonstrates that mast in those currents and not being stable enough could be very dangerous for downtown New York. Lastly, even state laws became an obstacle for the dirigibles such as in paragraph @NUM3 it states ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building"" This justifies that this was also an obstacle that the builders faced"	3	3		3																					
16137	6	There was many obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow the dirigibles to dock. One was the weight. The architects could not just place the mooring mast or it would rush the building. So they had to add over sixty thousands of dollars into the framework. Another problem was safty issues. Other countries used Hydrogen as their dirigibles gass. Hydrogen is highly flameable so that catching on fire above New York was dangerous. Another problem was the violent weather at the top of the building. The dirigibles would sway in the back due to harsh weather so geting pasengers on and off board would be extremly dangerous to them. Also there is a law in New York prohibiting low flying vehecales so the dirigibles could not had dock their in the first place.	3	3		3																					
16139	6	"There were a few obstacals to making this idea work. one of the obstacals was to make the mast and the frame of the building strong enough to support a dirigible swaying in the wind.

16140	6	"Based on the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there are many varied obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main reason would be the safety issues of the dirigible. Most dirigibles used hydrogen to be lighter than air. Hydrogen is a very flammable gas that could easily catch fire, just like the Hindenburg. If an accident like the Hindenburg were to happen over downtown New York, the outcome would not be good. Also dirigibles moored in open fields and would need to be anchored with big lead weights. These weights would niether be practical nor safe dangling above people and a small moring on the top of a building is no open field. One last obstacle is the sixty thousand dollars needed to just make the frame suitable for mooring dirigibles. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" With out a doubt, just to make a mooring for dirigibles at the top of the tallest building in the world would come with many different obstacles the builders would have to face."	3	4		4

""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (¶ @NUM2). This would have been very dangerous. A third obstacle was the law, which was impossible to get around. There ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (¶ @NUM3).

16158	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. The initial problem was that the blimp couldn't land on a flat surface. So the builders made a ""mooring mast"" so blimps could be connected by electrical winch to the building. But this caused problems too. They couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the building or it would be unstable. But most importantly since the winds kept changing it would never stay still. The problem of foreign blimps using hydrogen rather than helium made it to dangerouse to the public. In conclusion The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in trying to let blimps dock."	3	3		3																					
16160	6	"the builders of the Empire State Building bit off more than they could chew when constructing a mooring mast there. The first of several problems was that the presence of a thousand-foot long Dirigible would a tremendous amount of stress to the frame of the building, and @MONEY1 of modifications would have to be added. Safety was another pressing issue. In 1937, the crash of the hindenburg made the owners of the building realize how bad it would be if a zeppelin crashed over densely-populated New York. Not only was there an existing law that forbid airships to fly too low over urban areas. the factor of nature made the mooring mast Idea completely @CAPS1. Winds on top of the building are always shifting due to Violent air currents, even the capitain of the U.S. Navy ship Los Angeles could not land the dirigible. At this point It was apparent that the mooring mast idea would not work. And dirigibles were abandoned when airplanes, the method of aviation of the future, had arrived."	4	3		4																					
16161	6	"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle was modifying the frame of the building to acommodate for the stress that the mooring mast would put on the building. The load of the dirigible and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building which was eleven-hundred feet below. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made in altering the frame of the building. It was costly. Another obstacle the builders face was the gas used inside the dirigible, hydrogen. Most dirigibles outside of the United States use hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable and if a dirigible were to go up in flames above such a densely populated area such as downtown New York the results of the accident would be catastrophic. Nature was also another obstacle itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The dirigible would be swiveling around and around the mast. While lead weights were used in open landing fields, this was impractical to do above pedestrians on the street. Above all else an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the mast. These obstacles had made it impractical for a dirigible to ever dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building."	4	4		4																					
16166	6	"In their quest to allow dirigibles to dock, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into many problems. One of the more obvious issues was that of the make-up of the dirigibles themselves. At the time, they consisted of hydrogen, which, although allowed for a lower density, was highly flammable. This concept was proven and brought to light by the 1937 crash of the ""Hindenburg"", a famous dirigible. If a dirigible were to catch fire while docking at the Empire State Building, it would surely crash onto the civilians below. Another topic of debate for the architects of the Empire State Building was the issue of high winds at the estimated 1,250 foot altitude of the mooring mast. Such winds could easily cause a lack of stability for a dirigible which could in turn place added stress on the building itself. Another problem caused by winds is the fact that the dirigible might crash into other buildings, causing, the fabric containing the hydrogen gas to be punctured, and the dirigible to crash. In the end, it was a project deemed too risky to continue."	3	3		3																					
16171	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that they faced concerned safety. Many dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch fire of New York City the results could be horrific. Another obstacle the builders faced concerned nature. Due to the height of the Empire State Building the wind became a major factor. Wind currents were constantly shifting and if a dirigible was attached to it, it would be unsafe. The stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This meant that the frame of the building would have to be strengthened. Another obstacle concerned law. There is a law that states that airships can not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to tie a ship up to the Empire State Building.

16173	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had hopes of making this building a dock for dirigibles but were faced with several obstacles. Starting in paragraph @NUM1 the aspiration of the mast on the Empire State Building made the plan seem well put together and it would soon become a reality. As the project progressed many details went looked over and when the dirigibles were ready to take action the plan was not something forageable. Stated in paragraph @NUM2, safety was a huge issue for the dirigibles made outside of the United States, because they contained the flamable gas hydrogen. This is a problem because of the fear of an accident occuring in a  highly populated area. Another obsticle dirigibles faced while trying to have a dock on the Empire State Building was nature itself as presented in paragraph @NUM3. The winds on the top of the building had violent currents that were constantly shifting. The problem with the air would have the dirigibles constantly spinning around the building by its back end. This made it unsafe for passengers to get on and of and also the cargo. The greatest obstacle for dirigibles trying to dock on the Empire State Building is the existing law against flying too low over urban areas, which is found in paragraph @NUM4.

Their goal was to build a moor on top of the building in order for dirigibles, or blimps, to dock. In the end they were not successful. One obstacle was ""lack of a suitable landing area."" Without this, the dock would not work. Another main obstacle is the safety reason. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly fammable."" They could easily catch on fire and harm many innocent people.

This was the biggest obstacle the builders had to face. The builders developed a plan of ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself.

""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.""(paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle that the builders of the landing needed to get past was the element of nature. The winds at the top of the Empire state building were always changing due to violent air currents. A dirigible tethered to a mooring mast had the potential of wrapping around the mooring mast in the unpredictable winds. The workers could not trust the dirigibles to not fall off the mooring mast and risk the dirigible going right down where thousands of pedestrians were walking. The last obstacle that the workers had to get past was an existing law that prevented airships from flying to low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building..."" (paragraph @NUM2).

16194	6	"In ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia lusted builders who tried to make it possible for dirigibles or ""blimps"" to tie up to the mooring mast of the Empire State Building faced some problems they didn't account for. These were variations of blimps they didn't plan for, safety issues and also laws they would have to violate to have a dirigible land. The builders when making the mast didn't think deeply about any of these things.The problems the builders would face would appear right after the mast went up. To start the differences in blimps between countries was a factor, because blimps in the @LOCATION2 used helium to keep the dirigible flying but in places outside the states they used hydrogen which is flammable. This is a major issue for a place like New York that is densely populated. Another safety issue that they can't control was nature, the high winds atop the building would move the back of the blimp around and also when landing the window may push the blimp into the mast which would puncture the dome. Both these safety reasons were why blimps are landed on the ground. However even without both of these reasons there was a legal issue, a law that stated that airships can't fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to dock on the building.Having not considered all these things the builders put up the mast but unfortunately they would later have to face the differences in blimps, safety issues and legal troubles they didn't account for."	3	4		4

If the builders did do that it would cause too much stress to the building. The problem was solved after spending over @MONEY1 on a steal frame to support the mast.However, most of the builders problems were not able to be solved.

Although constructing this building took workers time and strength they didn't exactly get the purpose of the mooring mast. There were many reasons why they faced conflicts in attempting to let the dirigibles dock in the mooring mast. For example the dirigible was made up of helium rather than hydrogen, & hydrogen is highly flammable, so if they were to dock in downtown New York City it would have been a complete tragedy. Another reason is because dirigibles were moored in open landing fields, so it could weighted down. Author Marcia writes ""but using these at the empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets was neither practical nor safe.""

After the German Hindenburg went down it became apparent that the publics safety would be in danger from the vessels bursting into flame over crowded streets. At the time there were also @CAPS1 forbidding aircrafts from traveling too low over urban areas and the landing dock was too low. The final problem was the unpredictable weather.

People's lives shouldn't be risked just to land a dirigible.  Another problem builders face was nature.  In paragraph @NUM1 the excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""  This would mean the dirigible would just be dangling way above New York and winds could get dangerous very fast because it was so unpredictable.  According to the excerpt this was neither practical nor safe.  To add to all of these obstacles builders didn't consider an already existing law that is against airships flying too low over urban areas.

An other obstacle for the workes was that the driagbles would not be able to land easily. Finally, they would have to make sure that nothing is out of place and working."	1	1		1																					
16382	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety issues, nature itself, and the law.     Safety was a big issue when it came to dirigibles docking over a populated areas such as New York City.

After an accident in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State Building realized this accident would have been much worse if it were it New York City.     Nature causes lots of obstacles inlife, like wind which made it very hard to dock a big dirigible. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were teathered to the mooring mast, the back of ship would swivil around."" They would be dangling high above people which would not be safe.     There is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building.""

16390	6	"In The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, many contractors were exceedingly determined to construct a mast on the Empire State building to sanction the use of dirigibles, or blimps, to be the way of air travel for the future. There were great amounts of obstacles in the way of making this a reality. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building was a fantastic idea, but at the same time, proved to be just an impossible theory.The first problem was the weight of the blimp with the combined malicious winds, to eventually shatter the beautiful framework of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Architects soon fixed that problem when they impulsively spent over sixty thousand dollars on changes to the building to support this flaw, but this was not the only problem. The second major concern was the hydrogen that would be filling these blimps. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Hydrogen can easily create fires, which is a top concern in a densely populated city such as New York City. The most immense obstacle was mother nature. ""The winds on top of buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With dirigible flying above thousands of civilians, an uncontrolled aircraft due to high winds is not safe. The last impractical reason why this idea was not realistic was because of the law that forbade airships to fly too low in urban areas. All of those obstacles made building a mast on The Empire State building only a dream.Al Smith, the architect of The Empire State building, came up with fascinating ideas. Although they were great, they did not work. Between the environment, winds, hydrogen use, and safety laws, his dream was just a hoax. These obstacles made it impossible to proceed construction. Al Smith had amazing imagination with bad luck."	4	4		4

Adding a mooring mast would not be as simple as placing one atop the building. So the builders constructed a huge stainless steel enclosure to house passengers. this enclosure also had an elevator and stairs to bring passengers to the eighty fifth floor. Lastly, the builders had to complete the roof before framing the mast in steel. The concept of a mooring mast was ingenious although the practicality was soon found to be extremely low. Not to mention the fact builders were a thousand feet high. this idea presented many challenges."	1	2		2

The author wrote, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""

The original problem was figuring out how to get the dirigible onto the building. After consulting with the Navy as well as meeting with the president of newly formed ""airship transport company."" After this they thought they were past the rough of it, but there were many obstacles to come. Next, as they began constructing the mass, they realised with the height of the building, dirigibles landing would ""add stress to the building's frame."" The frame of the building would have to be modified to help fix this problems, and it cost over @MONEY1 to make these modifications. The prior two obstacles had been resolved, but the next bunch of obstacles caused the attempt, of dirigibles to dock, to stop in its tracks. Many safety problems posed as obstacles for the building team. It could be very dangerous, as some gases used in dirigibles are extremely flameable. Another obstacle is the ability to safely dock, at such high altitudes, with ""constantly shifting"" air currents. All of these problems were amplified because it was even more unsafe for these problems to exist in such a populated area. The build team was able to overcome some obstacles, but some caused too many potential problems to be fixed."	4	4		4

This had to be addressed, or the building would have been destroyed. Even before this, workers had to learn how dirigibles worked and how they could be docked on the buildings. They ""consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment"" just in order to learn how a dirigible flies and how it would be docked. Probably the most important thing the workers had to keep in mind was the safety of the public. This was very difficult to do, and unfortunately, it wasn't possible to build this mast so it would be safe for the public. This eventually led to the mast never being used as a docking station."	3	2		3

They had to make over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the framework before they could think of docking dirigibles there. After they finished building the conical top of the Empire State Building, the team working on the project realized that dirigibles could never be docked at the Empire State Building for several reasons. First, landing dirigibles was dangerous to the people of the city. Dirigibles contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and if there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York City, the damage would be devastating. Nature also prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building; air currents were too powerful, and if the ship did land, it would swivel around the spire of the building. It was possible to prevent this by putting lead weights into the back of the dirigible, but this was also unsafe for the people that lived underneath. The last obstacle the architects faced was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. Although the architects had a great idea, they never realized why it would not work until after building."	4	4		4

""Most Dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable.

16426	6	"Building the Mooring Mast was not an easy task, creating this futureistic design carried alot of problems beside it. Some problems that these builders faced were that Dirigibles can be up to one thousand feet long so they are very heavy and sway in the wind dangerously, it was also against the law for airships to fly at a low level over urban areas, and there were also a great danger of the Dirigible crashing, or catching fire over the densely populated area of New York.Even though these problems almost seem impossible to pass, they were able to fix up some things to make the project seem more realistic. The steel frame of the Empire State building was modified and strengthened so it could support the Dirigibles and wind pressure, but nature had no mercy and would sway the Dirigibles vigourously which was not safe nor practical. They were able to bypass the law and attempt to dock once which didnt end up working out after all. There had already been cases of Dirigibles crashing such as the Hindenburg. But and accident over a densely populated area would be horrific and not practical.

Other oposition to the idea was that most dirigibles that came from outside the U.S didn't use helium, but hydrogen which is highly flamable and risked the life of the people who lived around the Empire State building. Also the law was against this idea. There was a law that prohibet airships to fly too low over the urban areas. This law made the docking of the ships in the Empire State building illegal.

Another issue was the landing of the dirigibles themselves. They could be weighed down when on flat land but not on top of a building there would be many people below who could be injured if something went wrong.

Some of those obsticles included the violent air currents and constant change in wind direction on top of the building. With the wind changes, the dirigible could swing around and hit the building or other buildings and fall on the densely populated New York City below. The solution to this was to tie lead bricks to the tail of the dirigible like what is used in the feilds when they land.

Normally dirigibles would moore in open landing fields and then weighted down to ensure that they would @CAPS1 motionless on the ground, but since the builders of the Empire @CAPS1 Building are tempted to dock dirigibles @NUM1 feet in the air, nature and airspace laws come in to play. The Empire State Building rising 102 floors high was a feat in and of itself; the vision of dirigibles docking at such height by builders was maimed by both the forces of actual nature and legal disputes. The fact that dirigibles would have to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was not approved by nature. the winds in the airspace @NUM1 feet in the air were not only strong but constantly shifting due to violent air currents so forceful that even ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles... could not get close enough to tie up. It was too much of a safety hazard and gamble to more a dirigible with winds not cooperating. The most factual and practical problem builders faced with the idea of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State building dealt with a violation of an airspace law. The existing law banned ""air ships from flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning that legally it was a potential safety hazard to direct and dock a dirigible that high in the air. Without certainty for success, the operation of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was halted in the late 1930s. Although the builders of the great Empire State Building could build at @NUM1 foot sky scraper the attempt to dock dirigibles upon the building failed mainly because of safety hazards."	3	3		3

One that was expected was the building could be pulled over by the dirigibles as stated in paragraph @NUM1, third sentence. An obstacle that was unknown until after the mast was built was the violen shift in wind would cause the dirigibles to wrap itself around the mast and to dang weights off the back of it to prevent the wrapping was considered unsafe as stated in paragraph fourteen, second sentence to the fourth. Another untold issue was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM2, first sentence) along with the fact that ""most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.

16503	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many challenging obstacles that the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 as they were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York was determined to outstrip the Chrysler building by making the Empire State Building much taller. He had goals where the building ""would be equipped For an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers"". The first obstacle involved their expanded use in New York City, which was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith, however, saw it as an opportunity to have a a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there For several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on"". Al Smith's ambitions to enhance the building's height encouraged him to overcome this obstacle. Another problem with this however, was actually constructing the mast which led to a new obstacle. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were done to the Empire State Building because they couldn't have a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. If the dirigible was held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame. Even though this was an obstacle, the modifications to the building had adjusted this problem, and the builders were able to create the mast. As the progress of the Empire State continued, more difficulties kept arising which made the goas for Al Smith much farther away.Not knowing the fate of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, the builders realized afterwards that the mast's purpose became obsolete. The issue here was mainly safety which was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". They noticed after the mast's construction that it could have been a tragedy to have a dirigible go in flames above the densely populated city. Another important obstacle that interfered in attempting to dock dirigibles above the Empire State was nature itself. It was stated that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The builders knew that weighing down the back of a dirigible would be unsafe because of the pedestrians below. Even with all these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building continued to try to allow dirigibles to dock there, but over time the idea had faded away and they basically gave up on the project. Al Smith's goals were left uncomplete because of the challenging obstacles, but in the end, he did manage to establish the Empire State Building as the tallest in @ORGANIZATION5."	4	4		4																					
16511	6	"The obstacles the builders went through lallow dirigibles to dock there was that they wanted to put a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State buildings flat roof, but the problem was that the stress of the dirigible's load also the heavy wind pressure had to be transmitted to the buildings foundation, in which was about @NUM1 ft below. And since they had to do that The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation"	2	1		2																					
16512	6	"Some of the obstacles facing the builders was if they were to add on the mooring mast they would have to strengthen the building integrity. This is necessary because once the mast goes the wind, pressure would have been transmitted all the way down to its foundation. More floors would have to be added to house elevators and stairs to a ticket and laggage area. They had to find a way to attach the mooring mast to the foundation, which is nearly @NUM1 feet below."	1	2		2																					
16513	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders faced obsticles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building. One obsticle the builders faced was that they had to modify the buildings framework in order to install the mooring mast. The builders had to modify the building because ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure wood have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was eleven hundred feet below."" That was another obsticle the builders faced. Also, the mooring mast never fulfilled its purpose because of safety. Hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obsticle was nature. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The idea was neither practicle nor safe."	2	3		3																					
16515	6	"In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. When building the Empire State Building the architects had to take the height.. of the building and mooring mast into account. They simply could not drop a large glass and chrome mooring mast on top of the buildings flat roof. Also the wind currents over one thousand feet high our rapidly changing. An extremely large dirigible board at the top of the building would ""add stress to the buildings frame"". (@NUM1) The architects would have to modify and strengthen its steel frame for the safety of the building. These changes would cost over sixty thousand dollars. But alas, the mooring mast of the empire state building never fufilled its destiny due to these obstacles."	2	3		3																					
16523	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems and obstacles while attempting to allow blimps to dock there. One of their obstacles was that foreign blimps used hydrogen Not helium to stay in the air. If it blew up over New York the damage and death rate would be catastrophic. A second obstacle that they faced was that the elevation of the building was @CAPS1 high that there were strong wind currents. Making it difficult for the Navy's blimp the Los Angeles to come @CAPS2 the docking station at the mooring mast. Their final obstacle that they faced was the fear of the blimps going @CAPS2 another buildings Spire bursting a hole in the blimp: causing it to crash.The builders faced many obstacles such as the danger and high risk of a foreign blimp trying to dock and ends up blowing up since They are filled with hydrogen and not helium. Also since it is at such a high elevation the heavy wind currents make it difficult for the blimps to get close enough to be able to dock. Finally the fear of the blimp going @CAPS2 another buildings Spire puncturing a hole in the blimp causing it to crash.	3	3		3																					
16525	6	"In the excerpt the builders had many obstacles on how they could dock dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The first problem they had was because of the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM1). This was a problem because the winds could cause the dirigibles to crash into the building releasing it's gases. The second obstacle they faced was making the building structure strong enough to tie down the dirigibles. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modifyed and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@NUM2). This was a problem because if they did not strengthen the steel the dirigibles would weaken the building's structure. Those are the main two obstacles that the builders faced when building the Empire State Building @CAPS1 they could dock dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
16532	6	"In the excerpt of the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles, also known as blimps, where at the time of the construction of the Empire State Building, and the most advanced form of @CAPS2. The Empire State building was erected to tether dirigibles and allow them to unload and reload passengers and refuel. While building constructors realized, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings Foundation... eleven hundred feet below,"" (para. @NUM1). Plans needed to be made to support the building and blimps. The nature also was conflict to the project. Lead weights would be used to land dirigibles ""where they would be dangling high above Pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" (para @NUM2). Due to violent winds at the elevation these weights would waver the blimp and its weights. The aircrafts so were also at risk of landing on ""sharp spires of other buildings."" (para @NUM3). In addition a law for bid @CAPS2 from ""flying low in urban areas (para @NUM3). For these reasons the Empire State Building was never used for the docking of dirigibles."	3	4		4																					
16537	6	"Although adding a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State building is a very clever idea, there are multiple problems and concerns that accommodate this new feature. For example, even if the cable were fastened strong enough to the one thousand-foot dirigible, it would add stress to the buildings frame, causing the building to grow weaker much quicker than without it. In addition, to alter the dirigibles large effect on the building, it would be neccssary to have the dirigible's weight and the wind pressure ""to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which was nearly impossible considering this distance was over @NUM1 feet @CAPS1, @CAPS2 was a large factor in building this futuristic structure; over Sixty thousand dollars had to be collected to see better support the building's structure"	2	2		2																					
16542	6	"A mooring mast could just be put on top of the Empire State Building.  If thousand-foot dirigible more debt the top of the building, held by a cable tether, then it would add stress to the building's frame.  The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure have to be transmitted to the bottom of the building, which was eleven hundred feet below.  The frame would have to be strengthened and modified, and this would cost over sixty thousand dollars.  Nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast.  The winds were shifting because of violent air currents on the top of the building.  The back of a dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast.  Lead weights weighted down dirigibles, but they wouldn't be safe at the Empire State Building because there are pedestrians below.  These weights were used for open landing fields."	3	3		3																					
16551	6	"The dream for the Empire State Building was to allow dirigibles to dock On the top of it. It sounded like a great idea but the builders faced many obstacles trying to reach the goal of having them dock there. The first problem they faced was that dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the buildings foundation so it wouldn't stress the building's frame. To do this over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had been made. A glass and chrome nickel steel tower was made with a illuminated inside. The building was now 102 floors. Even though all the hard work the building was never used for docking purposes because of safety. One of the safety obstacles was that dirigibles wer highly flamable, after one caught on fire in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State building didn't want the same to happy in the highly populated New York City. Also another big obstacle was caused by the terrible winds. Even though there was a landing sight the dirigible could never be tied down so the passengers could get off. Also there was a law that stated the air craft's can't fly to low to urban areas. Through all the money and obstacles the builders had to go through to make this dream possible was never achieved."	4	4		4																					
16566	6	"Architects based in New York tried very hard to build a successful mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, to dock dirigibles for several hours for refueling or service purposes and to allow passengers on and off the blimp. While building, Architects faced some challenging obstacles that destroyed the chances of the mooring mast to open and become usable. A dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State Building only held by one cable tether would cause tension on the building's frame. The weight and wind pressure would need to be transferred to the buildings foundation. About over @MONEY1 of modifications would need to be made to the buildings framework. Another obstacle was the roof. ""When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place,"" wrote @PERSON1 in her article 'The Mooring Mast.' The greatest obstacle however was nature itself. Violent air currents caused the winds to change nonstop causeing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast. The only solution would be to weigh down the back of the craft with lead weights, but the risk was to much. Last but not least there was a line New York against airships flying to low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a blimp to even approach the Empire State building. As a result of not being able to use the mooring mast for dirigibles to station, the rooms set aside were turned into the world's highest soda fountain and a tea garden for tourist and sightseers. By the late 1930s dirigibles had become transportation of the past, and airplanes had made their way to the front of the crowd."	3	4		4																					
16570	6	"While building the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the first obstacles faced was competition. Al Smith, the governor of New York was determined to have the tallest building in the world, beating the Chrysler building which was also being constructed. This created an obstacle because it put pressure on Al Smith and the builders to makes such a miraculous, tall building.A second obstacle faced by the builders was having to create a successful mooring mast on top of the building that wouldn't harm the structure of the building itself. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Over @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the framework.The last obstacle was all the work put into the mooring mast for it to even be able to work. It was dangerous for diringibles to land there. The diringibles were highly flammable. Winds were harsh and unsafe, and there was a law prohibitting the aircraft flying so low."	2	2		2																					
16571	6	The builders of the Empire State faced alot of obstacles well trying to build it. Some of these obstacles was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single table would add stress to the base of the fame. Also the wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would make the back of the ship swivel around. There was alway the thought about how dangerous using hydrogen and helium that were extremely flammable. Those are some of the obstacles the builder face well trying to make Empire State taller.	2	2		2																					
16573	6	"After reading The mooring mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are evident. The number one reason is because it is not safe. First, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flamable. The chance of a fire starting is especially not good because its a highly populated area. Also, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (¶@NUM1). With the building being so high,"" winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (¶@NUM1). The conclusion has been made the dirigibles land in landing fields because they can be weighted down in the back with lead weights. This method would not be safe if used on the Empire State Building. Clearly, the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with too many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
16574	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The @CAPS1 problem was the issue of safety. Most dirigibles @CAPS2 using highly Flammable gases such as hydrogen. This could be a detrimental problem if the dirigible ever caught fire above New York's public. Another problem was working with nature. There were violent air currents constantly shifting atop the building, causing the back of ships to swivel around the mooring mast. The dirigibles couldn't simply be weighed down in the back, because that would be a safety hazard. The last problem builders faced was the law. At the time, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over cities. To tie up a ship to the Empire State Building would be considered illegal."	3	3		3																					
16578	6	"In this excerpt the builders of the empire State building were faced with many problem's trying to build a dock for dirigibles. The first problem they were faced with was how could they put this much stress on the building's structure, As mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. Another problem the workers faced was the safety of the city people below. What if the dirigible caught on fire like the Hindenburg and all the pedestrians below would be in danger. Also the building around it would in harms way too. As stated in paragraph @NUM2 the dock was never really ment for use. I think They just wanted a reason to make the building taller than the Chrysler building."	2	2		2																					
16581	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles and they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the overall safety. Dirigibles that were built outside the U. S required the use of hydrogen. Hydrogen is an extremely flammable gas that poses great danger. An example of this was when the Hindenburg was destroyed on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey. It finally occurred, that if a dirigible was destroyed over a densely populated area, it could potentially hurt a lot more people. A second obstacle that builders had to face was nature itself. At that altitude, there were violent air currents causing winds to constantly shift. This was a danger to the landing of dirigibles too. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would keep swaying. It would be harder to dock passengers, and allow for inspections. Also, dirigibles would typically weighted down with lead weights. However, because it was so high up, this was not practical or safe. The last obstacle these builders had to face were laws. One specific law did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. It was also illegal for the airship to tie up or even aproach the building. Overall, these obstacles denied the potential of the mooring mast."	3	4		4																					
16586	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles throughout the building procedure. First, many of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen gas rather than helium and ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1 following the German dirigle Hindenburg, Empire State Building owners ""realize how much worse the accident could have been,"" and this resulted in the decision not to utilize the mast as a docking area. Also, when Al Smith decided to build the additional mooring mast onto the top of the building, due to the weight of the docking blimps, the architects had to invest ""over @MONEY1"" to modify the building's framework and enable it to support the weight of a dangling blimp @CAPS2, due to violent winds, the docking dirigibles could not properly land and ""were constantly shifting."" Lead weights couldn't be used because of the dangers and impracticalities the idea could set on the @LOCATION1 below. Finally, it seems that the overall safety and practicality of the mooring mast weren't easily attainable. Al Smith states himself that the engineers are ""trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement. Hence, the builders of the Empire State experienced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building."	4	3		4																					
16592	6	"In the excerpt  ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there are many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The task of the building something on the Empire State Building that would allow dirigibles to dock there was a daring and dangerous job.There were many obstacles the builders faced. One obstacle was the winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would make building very difficult because everything would get blown around. Another obstacle was that ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" That means the builders first had to make the building strong enough to hold the docking place before they could start building the docking place.These two obstacles that the builders faced made building the docking place much harder. It took much longer because they first had to make the frame of the building stronger. Also they had to watch the wind so that they would not get hurt."	3	2		3																					
16598	6	"The weight was an obstacle they faced. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the to of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the building's Frame.

The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified & strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The weight of the dirigible would be to heavy for the frame because the frame wasn't made for that much weight. Some dirigible were highly flammable ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" They felt that it was to dangerous because it was located in a densely populated area. The air pressure was another obstacle that was faced. ""Fearing the winds would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other building in the area, which would puncture the dirigibles shell...."" The last obstacle was the law. ""The other particle reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas.

16606	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles. One of those obstacles was making sure that blimps and other air born transportations didnt interfer with the building. Also another obstacle the builders had to deal with was making sure the docking areas were safe.

So Because of that proBlem The @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 had to come up with a way to modifey the frame of the Building so that the Building could put up with the added stress of the mooring mast.

16625	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the mast would be too complex, which the builders did not realize at first. The most complex obstacle was how the builders were going to securely tie the blimp down without it not only spinning around, but from ripping the building out of its foundation. The constructors also had to worry about if it was safe or not and if it was permitted. Another major obstacle was that not only were the dirigibles too low to the ground to dock, but they were mostly made up of hydrogen instead of helium, which was very flammable. After all the hard work to be successful. Al Smith and his peers had to look out for the best interests of the people of New York."	2	2		2																					
16628	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there like nature, law, and of the sharp spire. Nature was proably the biggest problem because you can't control wind. The wind at the top of the Empire State Building were so strong cause ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."" This would make it hard to land and unland the dirigibles. Law was also a problem. There was a law that prevented ""... airships flying too low over urban areas."" The spire at the top of the building was sharp enough to pop the dirigibles that flew over it. If a dirigible was to hit it it would pop the dirigible and kill many people below."	3	3		3

Once we hit the sand we were running side by side with the wind wistling past our ears like a moving train. The horses heads were equaly pointed towards the ocean. When we got to the water, the horses pranced and danced arounds like yearlings again, @CAPS2 would walk tell into the water tell it was drenching us both then soon as the next wave would come rushing up, we'ed swerve around and try to beat the wave to the shore.   After about five hours of adventuring caves, sand dunes and starfish we were all worn out, then decided to call it a day. It was around dinner time, so we eat dinner while watching the sun go down to finsih the perfuct day at the beach. We put the horses back in the trailer, and before I shut the trailer door I gave my horse a good pat on his neck, as I was about to walk out my horse tured his head, then gave my a nudge like he was saying ""thanks for the good time"".

There many different kinds of laughter, like cracking a joke, or someone does something very embarrassing. The story that I will be telling is about how such a bad day for hunting turned into the funniest moments ever.   It all started in the @TIME1 when I woke up, and I had forgotten to put my wet clothes that were in the washer machine to the dryer. Now I had to dig through all my clothes up in my room and find camouflage clothes that weren't dirty, or were something that I could wear. By this time anybody would be in a bad mood, and trying rush to get out the door. When my buddy @PERSON1 showed up and was ready to go and I wasn't. I was rushing, and when you rush you are bound to forget something, and I had left my gun at the house. Five miles down the road I noticed that I had forgotten my gun, so we turned around and went back to go get it. Not only now we were late, we were speeding to the cabin for breakfast, @PERSON1 had the eggs so that we could make omelets. As we are racing down, we hit a bump in the road and everything, I mean everything hit the ceiling in the truck and then slammed to the floor. In doing this all the eggs broke in the egg carton, so now we had no eggs, and no eggs meant no breakfast.  Its about thirty minutes till shooting hours, and we are late showing up to the blind so that @PERSON1 and I can meet up with our other friends, @PERSON3 and @PERSON2. Finally we get to the blind right before sunrise and while we are getting all set up, a group of twenty mallards drop in unexpected and took off before we could get a shot off. Now were all thinking great their goes our opportunity to redeem ourselves from a terrible @TIME1. Only to find out that those ducks were the only ducks we saw all day.   At around twelve o'clock we gave up, and went back up to the cabin, but on the way up we got stuck in two inches of water in a truck. I remember thinking to myself, ""@CAPS1 this is not really happening to us right now"". So @PERSON3, @PERSON2, and I got out of the truck to push, and @PERSON1 stayed in the truck to drive. Their were many attempts to push the truck out, and finally on the sixth try we pushed the truck hard enough to get it out of the muddy water. Now the funny part, when we had broke the truck free @PERSON1 laid on the gas causing the truck tires to spin, and spray mud everywhere. When I saw the amount of mud being hurled everywhere I jumped behind @PERSON2 and used him as a shield from the mud. By this point @PERSON3, and @PERSON2 are @CAPS2 in a inch thick layer of mud from head to toe. You couldn't help but laugh, it was the funniest thing ever. @PERSON1 had watched it all through his rear view mirror and as soon as he was safe from getting the truck stuck again, he fell out of the truck because he was laughing so hard. Even @PERSON3, and @PERSON2 were laughing a bit too.  So when its a day when nothing goes your way or having bad luck, you never know what the day has planned for, in this case its one of the most memorable things I remember that happened that duck season."	20	20		40				4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4

Expecialy because in @NUM1, i was going to be meeting my host parents that i never saw before @CAPS3 wondering if they were going to be normal people or a pair of complitely weirdos.Once in the plane i sat with a young girl that was in @LOCATION2 studing arquitecture @CAPS3 going back home for winter..when i was just going away from it.@CAPS2 asked ""@CAPS1 you speak english"" @CAPS3 i said ""I try to"" @CAPS2 laught,@CAPS2 looked nice,with a big smile,@CAPS2 was pretty too.We started talking @CAPS3 @CAPS2 felt how nervious @CAPS3 anxious i was.@CAPS2 asked me if i was ok @CAPS3 i told her that i was going to be a foreing stage studient for the next year @CAPS3 my concerns about it,like meeting people or missing home.@CAPS2 told me""you will be fne,dont worry about it..i wish i had that chance when i was your age""@CAPS3 then changed the subject.After a long conversation @CAPS2 started reading a magazine @CAPS3 i put on my music.When we were about to get @LOCATION1 @CAPS2 all sudenly screamed so hard that made me jump,we laugh for a long time @CAPS3 @CAPS2 couldn't even talk to me @CAPS3 explain why did @CAPS2 scream because everybody was looking at us @CAPS3 that made it even more funny @CAPS3 kind off embarazing too so @CAPS2 could not stopt laughing.Then @CAPS2 told me that the guy in the picture of her magazine went with her to highschool a few years ago @CAPS3 they were together for some time but since graduation they didnt know anything about each other.He was now working at a bank @CAPS3 making good money,really good money...@CAPS2 was going craizy talking to her self @CAPS3 asking why in the word @CAPS2 stoped talking with him.That good time with her,even if i haven't seen her again made me really happy @CAPS3 by the time we got off of the plane i was more confident @CAPS3 almost forgot about all the nervious that i was before.After @NUM2 months here,everything is going perfect @CAPS3 im sure that even if it was just a few laughs @CAPS3 not a really long time on that plane,when i go back @LOCATION2 @CAPS3 think about @CAPS4 i will think about her,@CAPS3 i'll count that moment as my first good @CAPS5 expierence."	16	18		34				3	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
20748	8	"Friends are'nt always what we want them to be they arent always easy to find, but with a smile and a laugh a friendship can become. I mean what is a friendship if there isnt those moments where you laugh until you pee. When you laugh until you can't breath and you feel like you have just done one hundred sit-ups. Ofcourse you @MONTH1 meet a friend like this and it @MONTH1 happen when you least expect it. I didnt expect a new friendship but in a new town and with new people i met the friend i now call bestfriend.  It was the year of @NUM1 and i was new to @ORGANIZATION1. In homeroom everyone stared at me like i was some kind of criminal and everyone talked behind my back when i would pass by their desks, well atleast thats how i felt. My homeroom teacher @PERSON2 @CAPS1 me my so called schedule. Sixth period, @CAPS2 class with @PERSON1. What? @CAPS2, what is that. I really had no idea what a @CAPS2 was until i walked into that class. I turned the rusty knob of the door to the gym where my class was supposed to be. I walked in and well there I found out what a @CAPS2 was. It was a one wheeled bike. Wow! I laughed thinking how did i not know that.  I looked around and saw that i was the only sixth grader around. I took a seat and looked everywhere trying to figure out if i was really the only sixth grader there, when in walked a girl that looked about my age. She took a seat and i wondered if she was nice so i could go talk to her, but i was to emberrassed to. @PERSON1 asked everyone to get in groups of two and i asked the girl if she wanted to be my partner. We started to useb the unicycles and our partner had to help us get on and ride until we could ride with no help. Class was over and i tolde her my name was @PERSON3 and she told me her name was @CAPS3. I was super excited to go to class next time because i now actually had a ""friend"" well atleast someone i talked to. I went into the class and she was absent so I was a loner that period. I had to be partners with this other girl named savannah witch was a total girly girl. She didnt want to ride the @CAPS2, all she wanted to was talk. I was sick and tired of her by the end of the day and I had'nt practiced my unicycleing.  I was really hoping @CAPS3 would show up to class the next day, and she showed up. This time we had to get with our partner and make a routine to a song that we wanted so we were pretty stoked. We started practicing and trying to come up with something when suddenly we both fall. We stared at eachother and just started laughing and laughing i couldnt breath and she almost peed. It was one of the best times i had experianced that year, and i felt like me and her could become the best of friends.  We are now really close friends and just that one moment of laughter together brought us close at heart. We love to laugh we believe that the more you laugh the younger you look and well i think its true. everyone has their own story about how they met a certain person and how they became so close. I believe that in every friendship what braught it together was a smile or laughter. A laughing moment where you laughed so hard you farted and milk came out of your friends nose. Its a great time and you never forget it, its something that is so simple but so special and it really marks your heart and the way you feel around that person. It braught my friendship with a person i had barley met into a friendship that is now insepreable and amazing. "	19	17		36				4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3	3						
20751	8	"  It was a normal bright and warm @DATE1 day, going into my fifth grade year. My older sister and I had been playing all day with my other neighbors that were around our age. One of those neighbors happened to be a boy. We could not find anything to do. It was too hot out to just go walk around in the sun, so we decided that it would be cool to play in the shade with the new slingshot my @CAPS1 had made. He made it out of an old swing set seat and I thought my neighbor would really enjoy it.  We all headed into our garage to get it. My sister offered to get it down for me since she was taller and it was hanging up pretty high, but I refused. It was my idea to show him so I would be the one to get it. As I was in total concentration, stretching and reaching to grab it, I noticed everyone around me giggling. My concentration got weaker as I begun to wonder what they were all laughing at. I stood there confused for a minute before I had found out what happened. My sister pulled down my pants.. in front of our boy neighbor. I picked my pants up off the ground, looked straight at my sister, and started beating her with my flimsy loose fists. I ran straight to my room, crying all the way there.   My sister came in a few moments later trying to bribe me out from under the covers with the last two fruit role ups. She sat on my bed waiting for a half an hour, I didn't budge. She did not say anything but I could feel her eyes piercing me through the sheets. Later that night I finally came out. My sister kept on apologizing but it didn't matter to me because I was upset with her, that's all that mattered. The whole next day passed and nothing had changed. She was still apologizing and I was still in the ignoring mood. My @CAPS1 came up to me and told me that she was terribly sorry and upset too because I was not talking to her. I thought in my head, "" how could she be upset.."" but I realized I had not treated her right, even though I wasn't happy with her.   After hearing what my @CAPS1 had said, I decided that it wasn't worth it. I went and talked to my sister for the first time in days. She told me that she didn't mean to hurt my feelings, she was just messing around. After talking about it for a while I concluded that I got so upset because she did it in front of our friend. We joke around like that all the time, but it's never in front of anyone besides family. I was scared that it would have frightened our neighbor friend away, but he was back to play in a few days so I had nothing to be mad about.   Even though I was embarrassed, I admitted that it was pretty funny. We had a good laugh about it and were no longer enemies. I learned that dwelling over the past gets you nowhere and you have to learn to laugh things off. Ever since then, every time it is brought up, we laugh so hard tears role down our face. I would not have considered it a good thing when it happened, but I do now. It is another memory that my sister and I share and can reminisce about. The more laughable memories you share, the closer it brings you to some one."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
20764	8	"                        `   THE @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 story is about how I fell in dog @CAPS1 and stepped in it, I fell off of a slippery trampoline.about four or five years ago I went too a friends house to stay the @TIME1. That day was a hot day so my friend and I devised a plan to have fun and stay cool, so my friend and I went to the garage and found the sprinkler, so we decided to put the sprinkler under the trampoline and when u do that it makes the trampoline wet and slippery. My friend and I started jumping on the trampoline and he was starting too jump higher then me and I started losing bounce and he came back down the same time as me, but he had more bounce, which made me bounce a lot higher then I normally could also he weighed more then me. So i came back down and I landed on my back and the angle I was at on the trampoline shot me off. As I was bounced off the trampoline I thought I was gonna get hurt and I had rather gotten a few scratches then landing on a dogs manure, but that's just what happen I landed on a pile of dog manure and it really stunk my shirt up so bad, but after i took my shirt off i started jumping again and i jumped for that whole day about but i don't regret it it because after that everyone had a good laugh including me. so @CAPS3 story was a part of laughter and how laughter is a great way to have fun and even when it @MONTH1 have been a bad thing that happen to you, maybe in the end it was funny even though at the time it was not."	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	3						
20770	8	" Laughter is indeed an important part of anyone's day. For whatever reason, humans like to laugh, and they like to make others laugh as well. But that reminds me of a funny story... There was this time that I had to take a writing test. In fact, the test was very much like this one. In fact, it was this one. I had to write about one of four topics. Unfortunately, all four of them were about as vague as they could possibly be, and this made picking one rather challenging. After staring at the screen for a good fifteen minutes or so, I began to silently laugh at my situation: I have to write about one of four things when not a single one was even remotely interesting. For some reason, I found my problematic situation amusing, as I am kind of weird that way. But then it hit me... one of the four topics was about laughter... why not write about myself laughing at the irony of my situation? Yes, all I had to do was tell a true story about a time I laughed, so I used this delightful vagueness to my advantage. The topic did not state that the laugh had to be an actually audible one, nor did it state what kind of laugh it had to be, so I figured a silent laugh at irony would do just as well as an audible laugh at something silly.  So now I had my topic. To make things even more amusing, as I wrote about myself laughing at the fact that I had to write about myself laughing, I began to laugh at how silly the task I was carrying out was. However, I began to worry that whoever is grading these things @MONTH1 not find this as amusing as I did, which would perhaps hurt my grade. But that possibility served only to make the situation even more ironic, and consequently amusing.  You @MONTH1 think that I am easily amused, but to that I must say: well, yeah, I kind of am. I can find almost anything amusing, but that, I find, is the beauty of laughter. It is so abstract, that each and every person experiences it in differently. Some people @MONTH1 find very simple things considerably amusing, but others @MONTH1 be not so easily amused. These differences are part of why interacting with other people is so enjoyable. As I said before, humans like to laugh, and we like to make other people laugh with us. And regardless of the way you @MONTH1 interpret laughter's abstract form, you've got to admit: it's kind of funny."	21	18		39				4	4	4	5	5	4	3	3	3	4	4	4						
20796	8	" Laughter is an important element to have in life. Because without @CAPS3 there would be no happiness or joy in the world. @CAPS1 are a great source for laughter, @CAPS1 are the people you go to to be yourself. Some people use laughter for to release pain. For example, whenever @CAPS10 dad gets hurt he starts laughing. @CAPS10 @CAPS2 was in the navy a few years ago. And during training he got hit in the stomach. Nothing really was wrong, but @CAPS3 did hurt him. so @CAPS10 @CAPS2 sat down and started to laugh. I guess this so-called trait is hereditary because I find myself doing the exact same thing from time to time.  When I learned about how laughter heals, @CAPS3 wasn't too long ago. @CAPS3 was last @DATE3, @CAPS3 was early @DATE5 and @CAPS5 of @DATE5 was coming close. Traditionally me and @CAPS10 parents would drive to @ORGANIZATION1. And use the money we have been saving up all year round and buy a huge pack of fireworks.  Once @CAPS5 of @DATE5 came I was filled with joy, I woke up and immediately run up to @CAPS10 mom and ask ""@CAPS3's @CAPS5 of @DATE5 can I take the fireworks out to the package now?"" I was a new puppy discovering its first chew toy. @CAPS7 shook her head ""@CAPS6 yet @PERSON1, its only eleven in the morning. Sunset doesn't come around till seven or eight"" @CAPS7 smiled at me. ""@CAPS8 girl."" @CAPS7 whispered as @CAPS7 left the room.  Once the huge golden sun finally went down and the smaller bright shimmering stars appeared. We all knew @CAPS3 was time. ""@CAPS9 you like to do the honors?"" @CAPS10 dad handed me the first firework and a lighter. A big smile appeared onto @CAPS10 face without @CAPS10 control. I loved fireworks, I love bright colors watching them as they spewed into the newly lit sky, filling @CAPS3 with a sea of colorful sparks. After @CAPS5 of @DATE5 had ended @CAPS10 cousin @CAPS12 came over. @CAPS10 mom had was little sick but @CAPS3 wasn't something that was contagious. @CAPS10 @CAPS25 figured that we were old enough to take care for ourselves and for @CAPS10 mom. And @DATE3 was ending and I wanted to see the movie @CAPS13 with @CAPS10 mom and @CAPS12 so badly.  @CAPS10 mom had a lot going wrong her doctor put her on several medications to relieve her problems. but @CAPS3 seemed like @CAPS7 got a new pill from the doctor every week because the symptoms from each pill was causing more and more problems.  Its mid @DATE5, @DATE4, and still no sign of @CAPS10 mom getting any better. @CAPS12 and I took walks with the dogs to the near by park, we went swimming, watched @CAPS15, clean the cars, We would try to find anything to do really.  @DATE1 came, and @CAPS10 mom was showing signs of improvement @CAPS7 was walking more naturally . I called @CAPS10 dad and asked if he thought going to see a movie was a good idea. he said to wait one more day. I was worried about waiting another day because @CAPS12 was going home the next day. The next day, I woken up by the soft whisper of @CAPS10 moms voice. ""@LOCATION1, @PERSON1 honey wake up"" @CAPS7 shook @CAPS10 shoulder. I opened @CAPS10 eyes slowly, opening them wider as @CAPS10 eyes focused of what was around me. ""@CAPS18 go to the movies?"" @CAPS7 shook @CAPS10 shoulder once again. ""@CAPS19, but your sick."" I exhaled a heavy sigh. ""I am feeling a lot better today."" @CAPS7 smiled. ""@CAPS21 because the next showing is in twenty minutes."" The sudden rush to @CAPS21, woke me up. I then woke @CAPS12 up and we soon then left. The movie was good. Afterward, @CAPS12 went home and everything was silent once again, the rooms kept empty, the sun went away, the whole house stood still.  @DATE2. this day is usually a time to kick back. I was on @CAPS10 computer most of the day, @CAPS10 dad was playing his video game. and @CAPS10 mom was in the kitchen preparing dinner. @CAPS10 dad went in to help her with dinner. until @CAPS7 almost had fallen with a few pans in her hands. @CAPS10 dad suggested that @CAPS7 go and take a nap or at least lay down. Later that evening @CAPS10 dad had found @CAPS10 mother. laying stiff, cold...@CAPS10 mother had passed away in her sleep that day. I felt as if @CAPS10 heart had exploded like a firework. A few days have passed I stood still on the couch. I found comfort in texting @CAPS12. Told her what the doctors told us. @CAPS12 mentioned how torn @CAPS10 @CAPS25 was about @CAPS10 mom. And even though @CAPS12 was hurting inside, her and her @CAPS2 @PERSON2 tried to get @CAPS10 @CAPS25 and everyone to laugh. Because they knew that laughter would make some of the pain go away. And I think they are amazing for finding a bit of laughter in a dark place. That is why laughter is a important element of out lives. "	18	17		35				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	3	3						
20806	8	" There are a couple things that can lead strangers to being comfortable with each other, in my experience it was laughter. Meeting my boyfriends parents was very nerve wrecking and uncomfortable. I am a people person and I can get along with anybody. Starting a conversation with someone who is judging my every move was a little bit of a challenge.  My boyfriend @PERSON3 and I have been dating for almost a year now and are the type of people that like spending time with our families. So because of this it was obvious that meeting the family would come into play. I met his parents when we were young and we attended the last years of elementary and some of middle school and all but one year of high school together, I left for a couple years and came back really different. So after @NUM1 months of dating I met the folks.  One day in @DATE1 @PERSON3 had a football game that i attended with some girlfriends who were also dating guys on the team. After a terrible loss @PERSON3 came out of the locker room and hugged me and told me it was time to meet the parents. I took a deep breath and started to get really nervous. I love meeting new people and I usually don't have a problem with it, but the fact that I wanted his parents to love me put a lot of weight on me.  I slowly walked over after him, and said ""@CAPS3"" in my most friendly voice possible. His mother reached out and said "" @CAPS1 @PERSON1, I'm @CAPS2"" I took her hand and shook it and replied ""@CAPS3, so nice to meet you"". I looked at @ORGANIZATION1 for reassurance then his father reached out with a very welcoming smile and his eyes looked so familiar and warm. "" @CAPS4 there, I'm @PERSON2"", I shook his hand and felt less nervous and a bit comfortable. "" @CAPS1 , great to meet you, what did you think of the game?'. He looked surprise that i talked and we started a great conversation about football.  After talking about football for about @NUM2 or @NUM3 minutes @PERSON3 brought up something that reminded me of a joke. I always have lame jokes so I was nervous about telling it to his parents. It wasn't even a funny joke, @PERSON3 thought it was lame, yet i loved it. I took the chance anyways. I said "" @CAPS4 that reminds me of a joke"", @PERSON3 looked at me with wide eyes that said oh god, don't. I looked away and started ""so there were two muffins in the oven one said, wow its hot in here, there the other screamed, holy crap! A talking muffin. I started laughing and my laugh is very odd. Anyone i meet tells me me laugh is so unique. His mother was like ""that is adorable i will have to tell it to @CAPS6"", I smiled gratefully. His father @PERSON2 said so sweetly "" I like your laugh, i ain't heard anything like it"". @PERSON3 came in and said ""yes her laugh is really something"". We all kinda smiled and at each other and went to dinner, cracking jokes and laughing then laughing at my laugh. Thank goodness for laughing, once we started laughing I felt comfortable and welcomed. Until this day we laugh at me telling that joke. I still until this day am happy i told the joke."	17	18		35				3	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
20807	8	"   On @DATE1, I had a mission trip meeting in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 at @NUM1 o'clock in the @TIME1. @CAPS11 friend @PERSON2 decided he would go with me. So I had @CAPS11 grandpa pick us up from the house and take us to @LOCATION2. When we got to the church I went to @CAPS11 meeting till @NUM2 o'clock, then went to bible study. I was tired and ready to go home by then.    Come to realize @CAPS11 grandpa is know where to be found, he apperently left to go home and @CAPS11 mom, grandma and @CAPS11 sister @CAPS3 had just got there to pick us up. I had just been informed that there was a parent meeting for the students going on the mission trip. After the meeting we went to @PERSON1 craft store. When we got there me and @PERSON2 went over to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, while @CAPS11 mom, grandma, and @CAPS3 stayed in @LOCATION3. I bought me and @CAPS11 mom a pair of comfortable slippers. then we went back into @PERSON1 to brag about the slippers to @CAPS11 mom and grandma.   That was a bad idea, @CAPS11 grandma decided she needed a pair for herself, so she walked over to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She was taking forever. I told her that if she stopped looking at stuff we would go to @CAPS6, get a sandwhich, and come back. So we did. When we got to @CAPS6 @PERSON2 was in a bad mood because he was ready to go home.   We ordered our sandwhichs and went back to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She finally found herself a pair of slippers, after looking for an hour and a half. Everyone gets in the car, and we think were going home when all of a sudden grandma shouts out ""were going to @LOCATION5's, I want a bowl of chili"". Our reaction was ""@CAPS10, @CAPS11 gosh"". We couldn't let her be hungry, so we had to stop. after getting her chili she says ""I need to go into @ORGANIZATION1"", @CAPS10 boy was that a mistake. We were in @ORGANIZATION1 forever in a day.   After we got back in the car from @ORGANIZATION1 I sat in the backseat in the middle of @CAPS3 and @ORGANIZATION2. I told @PERSON2 not to forget to show @CAPS11 mom an important piece of mail he had when we got home, and his response was ""@CAPS10 ya! If we ever get home"". All I could do was laugh. I was being video taped by @PERSON2 and @CAPS11 mom kept looking back at me to see if I was ok. I just couldn't stop laughing. I laughed so hard I was crying, I lost all @CAPS11 breath, and @CAPS11 face was as red as a cherry. I laughed without a break from @ORGANIZATION1 to @LOCATION4 road. When I eventually fell asleep."	18	17		35				4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	3	4						
20812	8	" Laughter. We all need it. We need it @CAPS8 a reminder that @CAPS7 is hope for those who have perseverance, for those who strive not to better others, but for those who strive to better themselves. We need it @CAPS8 a reminder to live our dreams, instead of dreaming of living. And, in my opinion, most importantly, @CAPS8 a reminder that even though we @MONTH1 make mistakes, @CAPS7 is still a chance for those who simply have the courage to seize it.   In the @DATE1, my foster parents decided to go out for dinner. The children, of course, were not invited. We were to either stay home with the babysitter, or go to a friend's house. No one wanted to stay home, @CAPS8 @CAPS7 was nothing to do. One of my best friends, @PERSON2, was a single child living with her grandmother. I made a quick phone call and ten minutes later I was waiting for her grandmother to pick me up. It was about five in the @TIME1, and I was to be back no later then nine. I had four hours, and it was two weeks before @CAPS1. Neither of us knew @CAPS13 to do with so much time on our hands. After all, we only saw each other for a few hours at school. This way new to both of us. We were both sophomores, and I had a crush on @LOCATION1. This turned out to be a big problem, considering @CAPS6 knew this piece of information. @CAPS6 didn't have a problem with it, but @PERSON1, her boyfriend, did. We got along, but he didn't like the fact that I was spending so much time with her, especially while he wasn't @CAPS7. He trusted me to take care of her though, so he didn't make a huge deal out of it.   We had decided to set up the @CAPS1 tree first, and go from @CAPS7. We both had @CAPS3, so just about everything on the tree was shiny. Tinsels, ornaments, pictures, @CAPS14 name it. It took about twenty minutes to get everything set up, not including the time it took to unpack all the decorations. It looked magnificent when we were done. I'd help make some pretty @CAPS12 looking trees, but this was by far the best. I was proud of our work. I didn't have much in my life to appreciate, so this was one of those things that normally wouldn't matter, but suddenly became really important. We admired our work for a few minutes and then went down to the den. @PERSON2 got on the @CAPS4 to talk to @PERSON1 for a bit, while texted my girlfriend. I was in the process of preparing myself to break up with her.   @PERSON3 and I had been together for most of my sophomore year, and I was beginning to regret it. Our relationship had started when one of my buddies, @PERSON4, and hers ended. I know this sounds bad, but I really didn't want to be with her at first. I was putting myself between @PERSON4 and her so that they would stop fighting so much. Now I was starting to see why he broke up with her in the first place. @CAPS6 was like a bad drug that got @CAPS14 really high, and then dropped @CAPS14 like a rock. @CAPS6 was extremely controlling. @CAPS6 wasn't @CAPS12 for me, and @PERSON2 had finally convinced me that enough was enough. After I broke up with @PERSON3, I felt both happy, and depressed. I was happy that I could be free, but I was depressed because I felt so alone. I'd never been @CAPS12 at getting close to people, so this was hard for me to do.   Seeing me so roughed up didn't sit well with @PERSON2. @CAPS6 knew me much better then most people, so @CAPS6 knew that I needed help quick. @CAPS6 did something so subtle, that to most it would have seemed unimportant. @CAPS6 took one look at me, got up from the computer, and gave me a long hug. At first I didn't think it was a @CAPS12 idea. Her boyfriend was very protective of @PERSON2. He didn't like guys getting close to her, under any circumstances.   ""@CAPS5 @CAPS14 please just try to relax for a minute? Your making me nervous."" @CAPS6 said in that tone that meant it was more of an order then a question. Maybe it was the fact that I was in such a bad mood that this seemed like the funniest thing in the world to me. I started laughing really hard.   ""@CAPS7. That wasn't so hard, was it?"" @CAPS8 @CAPS6 pulled away from the embrace, I kissed forehead; our way of saying ""your beautiful.""   ""@CAPS9 @CAPS14 going to be okay?"" @CAPS6 asked in a worried voice.   ""@CAPS11, I'll be fine. Thanks @PERSON2.""   ""@CAPS12. @CAPS14 never showed me that guitar thing.""   ""@CAPS13 guitar thing?""   ""@CAPS14 said @CAPS14 played guitar."" @CAPS15 then I realized that I might not ever get another friend @CAPS8 @CAPS12 @CAPS8 this one.   ""@CAPS16 @CAPS11. Come on. I'll show @CAPS14 how to play @CAPS17 man."""	20	19	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
20814	8	" Laughter is a mystery. Happens @CAPS2 ever it pleases. It puts smiles on faces. Laughter just happens in many ways it can. Although, mine just happened to end up in a crazy situation with a huge mess to follow it. Things got extream, unforgettable. Things you could never forget.  Around two months ago, in the cold @DATE1. It was my @NUM1 birthday. I threw a little party for myself at my house. Though, I was in for a little treat. @CAPS2 everyone arrived they all had a smirk on their faces. Nobody would tell me whats going on. I started to become distraught about it all. Until my buddie @PERSON3 and my boyfriend @PERSON1 walked into the kitchen with a @NUM1 pound bucket full of spaghetti, with a ten pound gallon can of tomato sauce. Next thing I knew my mouth was agape. I couldn't believe my eyes, not understanding why so much of it. Also, why did they have it. My mother walked out and exclaimed ""@CAPS1 up the cars, and let's go!"" @CAPS2 we approached the @ORGANIZATION1, I had a funny feeling in the pit of my gut. I looked around and noticed my sister in law was holding a video camera. Right then and there I knew something was going to happen. Something big, extraordinary, out of the extream and I was right. Spaghetti was flying everywhere, getting in peoples hair, faces. Clothes were getting stained and messy. Not to mention it was cold,wet and rainy outside. The fog made it hard to see who u were hitting and who was throwing it at you. By the end of the noodle war, I looked the worse. Even now the shoes i was wearing are stained. @CAPS2 we got back to my house we had to wash down with the hose. I swore i was going to get sick from the cold water running down my face. I could feel noodles falling outta my hair and clothing, the sauce steaming down my face. Laughing here and laughing there. Everyone was laughing at others for how badly they were covered with noodles and sauce. Eventually, we all got hungry. We decided on nachos. So, my mom poured two family size nacho chips on the table followed by two ten gallon cans of nacho cheese with jalapenos, olvis. You @MONTH1 think the noodle and sauce was messy, well that's where I went wrong. My friend @CAPS3 dropped nachos on my couch. @PERSON3 threw nacho cheese at @LOCATION1, she threw chips at @ORGANIZATION2. @PERSON3 tossed cheese at me and ended up on my dog. Let's just say my living room was a cheese fest. I couldn't believe that nacho cheese got stuck in my dogs fer and in all the girls hair. Chip crumbs were in the couch and cheese was on the floor and @CAPS4 tree. So @PERSON3 finally said""@CAPS5 more nachos!""  @CAPS6 on it was cake time. Ginger thought that there wasn't going to be another mess. Well once again she was wrong. They all started singing the happy birthday song, cameras were flashing, my mother in the background crying. She cries on our birthdays because she says its just a year closer to her kids moving out. I figured she would be use to it knowing that she already had two kids move out. All of a sudden there was frosting on my face! I rubbed the frosting off and smeared it on @PERSON1 face. Though he just rubbed it back onto mine. My mom grabbed a plate and threw it at @LOCATION2, she tossed it at @CAPS3 then @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON3 then @PERSON2. Chocolate frosting was everywhere along with nacho cheese. Soon after that we played video games. Of course me being me I played @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @NUM3 live on @CAPS10 @CAPS11. I got irritated with someone on the game and ended up throwing the controller at my television and broke it. Mother wasn't to pleased with me after that. Oh well, we still got to watch movies in the other room. Eventually people started leaving. Saying our goodbyes, ill see you @CAPS6, peace out dude. We said it all. I looked back in the living room and say nothing but huge mess of chips, nacho cheese, and cake. Not to mention my broken t.v. I got stuck cleaning the mess for over three hours. Though, we were laughing the entire time it happened. Having the greatest time ever with each other. If I could I would go back and do it all over again just for the fun and laughs. Laughter is everywhere. You @MONTH1 not see it right away. Though you will @CAPS2 you started laughing your brains out. Laughing puts everyone in good moods and smiles on there faces. It @MONTH1 also make a mess and put things in a crazy situation. You can't deny after them crazy situations that you would go back and do it again. Laughter is the greatest thing in this world we call @LOCATION3."	17	15		32				4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
20825	8	" In this essay I will be telling you about why laughter, conflict and trust is very important in an relationship. I have a very good relationship with my cousin. We will laugh, fight but always trust each other with anything. We have known and been with each other for the past @NUM1 year's of our lives.  Her name is @CAPS1. I love her more then anyone else in the world. One thing that does make us closer is that we laugh at each others mistakes. When one of us messes up the other will laugh at them and then try to help with the problem. When one of us does mess up with something we are always the first to now about what it was with or who it was with even if we do not like the other person that they are having the problems with. Conflict, I think is something else that i think is very important in a good relationship. Me and her fight all the time with each other. Even if its for the littlest and stupidest thing's. We always find one way to fight over something. If it's for the other messing up where it could or would completely mess with mine or her life. We protect each other from messing up are lives to much. We stop each other from doing really stupid things. We have strange feeling when the other is hurt or might be hurt by someone or something. Trust is something that is very important for a relationship. Trust, you can be there or tell the someone anything no matter what it is. Me and her now everything there is to now about each other. If you want to now something about me you could go to her and she could tell you. If you wanted to now something about her you could go to me and i could tell you. I could tell her anything even if she is going to be mad at me for a while if I ever really needed her to be there for me I now she would be as soon as possible. We will almost never judge the other for something they did or are going to do. We now what the other person has done and what they have not done as well. I would trust her with my life if I had to. She is my best friend, favorite cousin, @NUM2 mom, sister, and everything else to me. Me and her will always laugh at each other s mistakes. We will always have some type of conflict with each other but we will always be there to help the other one out for what ever reason it @MONTH1 be. those are the @NUM3 thing i think you need to have a good relationship with someone like i do with my cousin @CAPS1. and i still have this relationship with her and i will never be able to lose it no matter how hard i try to i now she will always be by my side."	15	18		33				3	3	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
20826	8	" Bell rings.  Shuffle, shuffle. @CAPS1. Snap. EEEE. Crack. Slam. Click, stomp, @CAPS1. Tap tap tap. SLAM. Creak. Shoof, shoof.  Sigh. Seventh class of the day. Here we go. ""@CAPS2! Tu va ou pas? On a +¬tude cette class-l+á. Tu peux aller au bibliotheque si tu veux...."" @CAPS3 all blinked at me, @PERSON1, @NUM1le and @ORGANIZATION1, chocolate-haired and mocha skinned, impatiently awaiting my answer. The truth was, I knew @CAPS3 didn't really care if I came or not. It made no difference to them if I trailed a few feet behind like some pathetic puppy. I was silent but adorable, loved only because I was an @CAPS4. Because I spoke fidgety @CAPS5. Because I was the exchange student, because my translator and colorful clothes were so shocking for ten seconds, and were then forgotten about.  I was a flock of seagulls haircut. So why are you here? I thought. Why did you go on exchange at all? You are the complete opposite of everyone here. No one wants you. Just go home.  But my ego had a ready answer. You begged for this remember? For months and months, it was all you wanted, all you thought about, all you dreamt about. So I went with the girls. As expected, @CAPS3 walked down the three-person wide staircase side-by-side, and I shuffled awkwardly behind them. Finally arriving at @NUM2scalier, we sat at a table, the three girls talking. I glazed my eyes over, attempting to look lost in thought, as if I didn't care I wasn't included. Selfish thoughts buzzed in my head; if @CAPS3 weren't talking to me, why should I make the effort to talk to them?   I really had no idea how @CAPS3 felt about me. How does someone feel about their shadow? @CAPS3 notice it, sure, but it never offers up insight, it never makes you laugh. It's all in the confidence, said my mother's voice, all how you carry yourself. But I knew it wasn't that simple. I was just too alien. These girls would never understand me, as I would never understand them. In frustration, I started to flick peas across the room with my spoon. Pat, flick, sproing.  This caught the interest of @PERSON1, as @NUM1le and @ORGANIZATION1 were discussing something very emotional. Tears began to pour out of @ORGANIZATION1's eyes. Sniffling, she and @NUM1le went to the bathroom, leaving me all alone with @PERSON1. Only @PERSON2 could have felt my felt my same emotion as he stared up at @CAPS6. Silently, I continued shooting peas. @PERSON1 just stared at them as @CAPS3 darted around the room. Suddenly, with a horrible miscalculation, a pea hit a boy in the face. And then, he turned around and swore. And then, @PERSON1 and I looked at each other from across the table.  And then, we laughed.  We laughed so hard I cried. So hard that huge, alien tears flooded from my eyes. People around us were laughing too, even though @CAPS3 had no idea what was so funny. I didn't even know what was so funny. But it didn't matter, because we were dripping tears and snot, reaching for each other, reenacting the pea hitting the boy's face. It was as if we had been friends for years, and laughing happened all the time. It was saturated with all the angst and lonliness and despair I had felt the past four weeks. The connection we felt was instantaneous, like lightening, the kind of connection I felt with my best friends back home. I felt that huge swelling sensation in my chest, like a balloon was stuck inside. My stomach was aching and my cheeks were so sore I felt them seizing up. My heart felt whole even for that second. My soul was open. It was the best laugh of my life.  Sniffle sniffle. GASP. Laughter. GASP. Swipe of tears. Sniffle sniffle. Laughter. GASP. This is why. I thought. This is why you came.

20836	8	"         The @CAPS1 Of Laughter In @CAPS2 @CAPS3 me laughter is important, we all laugh in our lives. It's a symbol of happiness, and it shows people around us that we care enough @CAPS3 listen and pay attention. With laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime. For my friends and I, laughter comes naturally and we all enjoy every moment of it. My friend @PERSON1 and I have known each other since the second grade and have been friends ever since. what has kept our @CAPS2 strong and still alive today, is the memories we have created through laughter. One memory I always seem @CAPS3 remember though, is the first time we had gone inner-tubing together.   There have been many memories made between @PERSON1 and I that we remember because of the laughter we shared. Yet the memory that always remains dominate, is when we had gone inner-tubing for the first time. It was our seventh grade @DATE1 and we had planned on spending as much time as possible together. Now this did not really work out because I had @CAPS3 babysit a lot, but she was a good friend and understood. So when we did hang out it was always so much fun. Now yes, we have had our up's and down's, and that comes with any @CAPS2. We got through it and ended up having one of the best summers together. That @DATE1 we would hang out at each others house's and go places together. Then one day @ORGANIZATION1's parent's had decided that they wanted @CAPS3 take a trip @CAPS3 the lake and go boating. @PERSON1's family invited me @CAPS3 come along, and so I asked and I was able @CAPS3 go with their family @CAPS3 the lake. I had been boating before, and @CAPS3 the lake that we were going too. What I was not expecting, was for @PERSON1 and I @CAPS3 go inner-tubing. It was exciting, and nerve-racking all at the same time; I had never laughed so much with @LOCATION1 in my life.Going inner-tubing turned out @CAPS3 be one of the best memories we had ever made together. During the entire @DATE1 whenever possible,we had gone inner-tubing, for me, the adrenaline was almost addicting. Laughing was almost always constant when boating because we just had the best time. It was our new story @CAPS3 tell everyone and we were both proud of it. When inner-tubing we had learned @CAPS3 work together and it helped our @CAPS2 a lot in a way. Also when inner-tubing we got @CAPS3 the point where we went as fast as possible and went as crazy as possible and we loved it.  That @DATE1 we made some of my most treasured memories, and we really owe it all @CAPS3 laughter. With laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime, and I am very grateful for that. If not for laughter I do not know where my @CAPS2 with @PERSON1 would stand. And because of that, I believe that laughter is important in any relationship or @CAPS2. It's a symbol of happiness and that is what makes life great."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20877	8	" I have had many great times with my grandpa. He is a very funny and loving man. When my cousin, my grandpa and I get together for a camping trip there is trouble coming no matter what. A few years ago he took me and my cousin on a two day camping trip along the @ORGANIZATION1. The first campground we arrived at had no open sites so we moved on to the next campground. @CAPS1 campground had tons of open campsites so we picked the best one we could find and stayed there for the first @TIME1. Later that evening we learned why there was no one at the campground. The reason was that there was a racoon problem a few days before and people were scared to stay in the campground for fear of attack or having their food stolen. We were lucky and never saw the racoon and we never lost any of our food.  The next @TIME2 on the way out we saw a sign that read ""caution racoon problem."" @CAPS1 made us laugh all the way to @LOCATION1, which is a small town on the @ORGANIZATION1. Once in @LOCATION1 we stopped for gas and more food to last through the @TIME1. While at the gas station we had little bit of an issue but it was very funny. A young blond woman came out to help us and she wasn't the smartest person I have met. She charged us three times the amount of gasoline than we bought and couldn't tell us where the nearest grocery store was. Well, as my grandpa is rolling up his window he mutters quite loudly ""dumb blonde"", while the woman was standing right there. She didnt say a word and my gandpa drove off with me and cousin laughing so hard we could barely breath. My grandpa asked us why we were laughing so hard, so we told him what the circumstances were when he said dumb blonde. He was so oblivious to the situation that he didn't notice what came out of his mouth at the time. What even made it better was that he drove off like nothing had happened. The next @TIME1 we stayed at a diiferent campground with no racoons. Still the @TIME1 was filled with laughter. We were roasting marshmellows over the fire after our dinner and for some odd reason my grandpa could not keep the marshmellow on his stick. He wasted about six marshmellow before he even got one that he could eat. And everytime he dropped one into the fire it got more and more funny. We laughed and laughed until our stomach hurt. The best part was theat my grandpa didn't think it was funny so he just looked at me and my cousin like we were stupid or something. In the tent that @TIME1 we were so tired everything seemed funny to us. We laughed at each other until two in the @TIME2. Thats when everything went silent and we couldnt last any longer. We were all asleep within seconds. My cousin and I have gone camping with my grandpa every year now for about four years and each year we have an adventure filled with laughter as we go closer to each other. My grandpa is a great man and I look up to him for many things in my life. He has always keep me laughing and I try to do the same for him. He and I believe that it is important to laugh together because it keeps you smiling and helps you grow closer to whoever you are with. Keep laughing and have a fun in all you do."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20881	8	"Once upon a time, on a late rainy night my friends @PERSON2 I decided @CAPS5 would be fun to go out in the woods @PERSON2 play @NUM1-go-seek. One of my friend's sisters drove us out to the woods @PERSON2 the idea of the game was that since there were four of us, two would go out @PERSON2 hide @PERSON2 tow would stay in the car @PERSON2 count until the other two were ready to be found. Well once while us four were doing that @CAPS5 was pouring down rain @PERSON2 very very muddy outside. Well the two that hide were @PERSON2 @PERSON2 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 the two that stayed in the car to count was me friend @PERSON3 @PERSON2 I. Before @PERSON2 @PERSON2 @PERSON1 went out to hide we all made up a signal to let the others know if we were okay or no. The danger signal was @CAPS1 @CAPS1. @CAPS3 after we had our little meeting @PERSON2 got everything situated @PERSON2 dealt with, @PERSON1 got out of the car @PERSON2 went of @PERSON2 hid while me @PERSON2 @PERSON3 stayed in the car to wait @PERSON2 count. After we counted to about @NUM2 we hear screaming @PERSON2 shouting. My first thought was that they just got chicken @PERSON2 maybe wanted to freak out @PERSON3 @PERSON2 I. I was curious @CAPS3 I cracked the car door open @CAPS3 I can hear a little better about what they were saying. Sure enough here came @PERSON1 @PERSON2 rite behind her was @PERSON2. @PERSON2 looked as if @CAPS4 was about to cry @PERSON2 @PERSON2 couldn't ran fast enough to get back to the car, @CAPS4 kept slipping @PERSON2 sliding everywhere all over on the road but @CAPS4 finally made @CAPS5 back @PERSON2 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 @PERSON2 crammed into the car with us. We all sat there crammed in this little car thinking about what they were running @PERSON2 screaming from, @CAPS3 me being the brave one at the moment decided to go take a look at things. Of course with @PERSON2 not wanting to look or feel like wimps followed close behind me. As I was walking down the road from where I saw them run from @LOCATION1 jumps out in front of me @PERSON2 says ""right over there I swear I saw something dart across the road!"" @CAPS3 I walked over to where @CAPS4 pointed @PERSON2 looked around thinking that @ORGANIZATION1's crazy @PERSON2 @CAPS4's just seeing things. But as I walk on, @PERSON2 grabs me from the back @PERSON2 screams. I turn around @PERSON2 look at her thinking ""what the heck is wrong with you people!"". @CAPS4 grabs me by the arm @PERSON2 looks up with a very frightened expression on her face. I turn toward her @PERSON2 ask her ""whats wrong"" @CAPS4 asks me, ""why does that tree look white but right there in the middle there is a big tan spot?!"" @CAPS5 was dark @PERSON2 I couldn't see very well but when I looked up I saw exactly what @PERSON2 was freaking out about. I go back to the car to get a flash light hoping a came see what is on the tree a little bit better @PERSON2 as soon as I make my way back to @PERSON2 by the tree, @ORGANIZATION1 lets out a blood curdling scream @PERSON2 yells ""@CAPS6! Its moving, whatever @CAPS5 is @CAPS5's moving @CAPS7!"" @CAPS3 as I approach the girls @PERSON2 rips the flash light out of me hands, turns @CAPS5 on @PERSON2 points @CAPS5 to the tree. Sure enough there was a big tan spot @PERSON2 the white tree. As us girls sat the waiting for @CAPS5 to move again @CAPS5 finally did. I flashed @CAPS5 with the flash light @PERSON2 started laughing. As soon as @PERSON2 get their feet under them they want to hit me because they don't know what is in the tree or what I was laughing at. As they approach me, I turn back to @PERSON1 @PERSON2 ask her ""@CAPS3 @PERSON2, do you want to see your monster?"" @CAPS4 freaked out again asking what is was. I told her, ""take a look at @CAPS5 for yourself"" @CAPS4 looked up @PERSON2 saw @CAPS5.... A large brown paper bag that got swept up by the wind. As soon as I see that @CAPS4 say @CAPS5 I told @PERSON2 what @CAPS5 was @PERSON1 her @PERSON2 I started cracking up laughing about @PERSON1 @PERSON2 her ""hideous monster"". Once I got my laughs out on @PERSON2, we all went back to the car where @PERSON3 was waiting @PERSON2 we left. Ever since that night @PERSON2, @PERSON2 @PERSON2 I will never forget that night in the woods. Every time we think about @CAPS5 we all start laughing @PERSON2 making fun of each other for being afraid of a brown paper bag."	16	12		28				4	3	4	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	3	2						
20882	8	" For me laughter makes the world go round. It is much needed to keep the world light and filled with a seance of happiness. You will hardly come across me with out a big old smile plastered across my face. There is so many stores to choose from but @TIME1 one will be the most fun to tell i think. It still makes me giggle just thinking about that @TIME1. I was going on a trip with my last boyfriend, @PERSON1, down to @LOCATION1 for the forth of @DATE1. They have a big forth of @DATE1 walk and i was lucky to get to tag along with him and his mom. We wear staying with good friends of his mom @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. There house was stunningly amazing, beaut full wood floors, big open living room that combined with the kitchen and dining room, vaulted ceilings, and a big stunning window that framed crisp @CAPS3. @CAPS4. Even with the house being so great my favorite part wear the rail rode tracks. Not more than a quarter of a mile through a little trail surrounded with woods wear two sets of tracks stretching out in both directions @CAPS5 far @CAPS5 the eye could see. My favorite part of the hole trip wear those tracks. It was the second @TIME1 of our stay in @LOCATION1 around @NUM1 o clock. @PERSON1 and i when for a walk in the refreshing @TIME1. We could hardly see and wear holding on tight to each other to try and keep balance. Smiling and giggling we finally stumbled out of the very well hidden trail entrance on to the tracks. Hand in hand we started to walk down the tracks just enjoying each others presents. In @CAPS4 the stars are the most stunning i have ever seen. I'm not sure why but the sky just seems to open up and look two times bigger than it relay is. @TIME1 @TIME1 was perfect for star gazing with out a cloud in sight. So we decided to lay down between the tracks and look at the stars. There we cuddled together for a good @NUM2 minuets. Then @PERSON1 looked up. I gave him a puzzled expression then i followed his gaze to see what had aroused him. Far in the distance was a light. Slowly advancing t words use. Sure-a-nuff it was a train at @NUM1 o clock at @TIME1. Looking back at each other we both laughed at the pure surprise of a train at @TIME1. @CAPS5 the train advanced we jumped up and off the tracks to wait for it to pass so we could resume our spot.  The train was going way slower than i was expecting. No more than @NUM4 to @NUM5 mile per hour. @PERSON1's eyes lit up with an idea and not thinking he said ""We should jump it!""  @CAPS5 soon @CAPS5 the words left his mouth he regretted saying them. I thought it was a great idea! But he tried desperately to convince me not to do it. I headed twords the track telling him to live a little and lets have some fun. I had never jumped a train before but from the looks of it @TIME1 train was perfect to try it out on. There wear long flat bead cars with handy little latters on each one. I garbed for one and jumped on right before @PERSON1 could stop me. He finally gave in and jumped on the next one. We wear both smiling and having a great @TIME1 when we jumped off and met in a hug. Then the train stopped. We froze. Then a light started coming our way. Freaking out, for sure thinking we would get in trouble i sprinted for the trail head with @PERSON1 close on my heals. I could not find the trail and the light was getting closer so we both jumped full speed straight in to a big bunch of bushes. There we stayed perfectly still tell the light passed us and the train began to rezoom its pace. I met @PERSON1's big fat smile and we both just rolled over laughing not being able to help ourselves. What wear the chances of going out for a simple walk and all @TIME1 happening. Still smiling hugely @PERSON1 leans over to me and gave me a perfect kiss. That was one of my best nights ever. @TIME1 is just an example of how smiling and laughter was a big part of @PERSON1's and I in our relationship. Love, friends, and laughter is the reason life is worth living.  "	18	20		38				4	4	4	4	4	3	5	4	5	4	5	3						
20895	8	" Just @CAPS1 walking through @ORGANIZATION2 in a banana costume with one of your best friends. We were trying to find the best costumes for a @CAPS2 party. When having so much fun by taking many pictures and videos we lost track of time. I can't even remember which one of us was laughing the hardest. @CAPS3 is just one example of the crazy things my friend @PERSON1 and I have done together. One thing is for certain, whenever we are together we are always laughing. Laughter reduces stress for both @PERSON1 and I. We were team members for the past six years. Both of us competed as gymnasts at @ORGANIZATION1. We worked out at the gym @DATE1 for four hours each day. That gave us no time to hang out with friends and just enough time to do homework. At @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1 and I needed to be focused so we wouldn't get hurt. @CAPS3 meant off the floor we needed laughter to reduce stress, as well as fear. In order to do that we would hang out a lot on the weekends and in the @DATE2 sun.  Our friendship was strong because of all the laughing and fun times together. When either of us became stressed we would make the other cheer up by remembering the times when we laughed our heads off. Even when we are not together we often think of the memories we have shared together. As mentioned earlier laughter also helps to reduce fear. It helps because if you were not having fun and laughing you would think about all of the bad things at could happen to you; then would you do have laughter involved it makes you want to do whatever it would be with your friend.  The laughter @PERSON1 and I shared always attached others to us. Whenever we were together others always wanted to join is because we were having such a great time together. For example, @DATE2 we were at @LOCATION1's house and we were playing outside on a warm, sunny day. We were laughing and all of a sudden one of her neighbors shows up. After one came, more and more kids and her friends came, after awhile it seemed like we had the whole neighborhood there with us. When we had a big group of people, @PERSON1 and I would choose a different game that would be better for a lot of people. It usually was a hide and go seek tagging game. Even though it wasn't just the two of us we were always laughing because we would trick everyone that was playing. It created a good and positive bond for the two of us even though there were more people. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS3 is how @PERSON1 and I became such amazing friends today. Without laughter, I do not think we would have been as close of friends if we didn't have laughter in our friendship. Our laughter brings us closer together every single time we see each other. Laughter really connects the bond between friends and its helps both of you get through hard times."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20896	8	" ""Many other people believe that laughter is an important of any relationship."" Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. I also agree with those thoughts.  I came to @LOCATION1 about @DATE1, I did not speak @CAPS1 at all that time. I started going school. I practiced saying my name, age, and where I came from before I go to school. Next day I walked in to school and I could see that everyone was looking at me. It was pretty scary to me. I looked back at one girl and she walked towards me.  ""@CAPS2, my name is @PERSON1,"" the girl said. ""@CAPS2, my name is @CAPS4. I'm from @LOCATION2. I don't really speak @CAPS1,"" I said to @PERSON1, then @PERSON1 started laughing so hard. ""@CAPS6-@CAPS6 you have accent,"" @PERSON1 said, ""it's really cute."" I laughed back. @PERSON1 looked really nice with her smiles on and we became friends so quickly. She was my first @CAPS7 friend ever.  I always thought that making new friends are hard, but the laughter made it much easier than it used to be."	15	15		30				3	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3						
20899	8	"We're happy together @PERSON1 told me @CAPS2 we lay on his bed. I just smiled and I knew this was going to be a really good relationship. @CAPS5 always made me feel so great. @CAPS5 made me feel beautiful. Now don't say your too young to know what love is ,@CAPS1 I've heard it from my mom every time I talked about him. But I know that no one has ever made me feel this wonderful about myself, made me feel perfect. When we are together it's fun. Most guys I have been with have not been @CAPS2 fun, @CAPS2 in our dates together, walking to the park too sit and talk, eating out to kiss in public. Before we were ever dating, We were best friends. We still are best friends. Everyone asked us @CAPS6 we were dating, The answer was always no we're best friend's, but I always wanted more. @CAPS5 has always made me laugh. I don't think we would have made such a strong couple @CAPS6 we didn't make each other laugh. Just thinking about @CAPS4 I first knew I loved him makes me laugh. I was walking to my @DATE1 class, and out of no where @PERSON1 grabs my arm and pulls me into a huge bear hug, and buried his head in my neck and laughed and said ""@CAPS3, you have some toilet paper sticking out of your pants"" I felt my face turn twenty different shades of red. I smiled and quietly asked him to hide me so I could grab it. When I got to my @DATE1 class I was thinking to myself @CAPS4 could @CAPS5 just say that to me, @CAPS5 must of wanted to embarrass me. But the more I thought about what @CAPS5 did and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 did it made me feel, well it made me feel like @CAPS5 really and truly cared about me. Wanting to help me out rather then embarrass me. I bet every other guy was laughing. Not @PERSON1... well after that happened we had a good laugh. After we laughed and joked about what happened to me, @CAPS5 looked up and kissed me. I didn't know @CAPS6 that was a best friend kiss, or a real love kiss. So I simply laughed. then @CAPS5 kissed me again. This time I knew it was a real love kiss. We weren't like most couples either. Which made us stand out, and the more we stood out the more people started to hate the fact that we were together. They would say some horrible things to me in the hallway about @PERSON1. Who knows what they were telling him. @CAPS7 some of my closest friends started to make rude comments toward me and @PERSON1. I know @CAPS5 didn't believe anything they were saying @CAPS1 @CAPS5 would laugh at everything people would toss our way. When @CAPS5 laughed I would always ask him whats so funny, @CAPS5 would say ""@CAPS6 they rumors aren't true then laugh about them, that way people will know your not bother by them"" I would have never thought about that. I'm the kind of girl who wears her emotions on her sleeve, so of course I would get a little peeved with all the stuff they were saying about us. After I started laughing at all the rude and nasty things people were saying,. They stopped talking about us, it was like magic. I never thought about being in @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 let alone @ORGANIZATION1, and finding a guy that would understand what I'm going through. Let alone someone who is going through something almost @CAPS2 difficult. My brother went to prison @DATE1, and I don't think I could have be able to make it through @CAPS2 much @CAPS2 I did with @PERSON1. I cried almost everyday at @ORGANIZATION1 with him. It's been about a year now. Every time I go see my brother I remember what @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS6 your happy the people around will be happy"" so I always put on a smile to see @LOCATION1, @CAPS7 though I know this will be the hardest years of my life. Laughing does really help. @CAPS7 @CAPS6 nothing is funny just laugh. God put you on this @LOCATION2 for a reason, and @CAPS6 you haven't found that reason laugh until you do. @CAPS1 the people in your life mean the world to you, and @CAPS6 they're down bring them up. I love @PERSON1 for helping me understand that life's to short to go unhappy then to have had a life without laughter."	17	20		37				4	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20905	8	" Someone once said laughter was the best medicine. To me it was like someone was saying ""@CAPS1! Life isn't gonna get any better so just enjoy it while you @CAPS6!"" @CAPS2 that's what I did for a while, but laughing at everything got old very quickly. Sad to say I still laugh at most things, even sad things. I laugh because I think that if I do then everything will just get better. That's not even close to what really happens. In fact it @CAPS6 only cause more pain and suffering in most cases. Like the time where I met this guy named @PERSON1. He was amazing. Most people who met him thought he was a god and when he heard people talking about him like that he would always get very upset. He was a human. Nothing more and nothing less. That's how I saw it and that's how he saw it too. When we first started talking to each other it was between notes I would give my friend @CAPS3 and @CAPS8 would give them to him. He was a very shy guy so he never wrote back on a piece of paper. Instead he had @CAPS3 tell me what he said. Then he finally got the idea to wright messages in her phone and then I would read them and answer back. it was fun for a while but I wanted to actually meet the guy. I had seen one of his rare pictures and it was true he was very handsome but nothing like a god. He didn't have a wreath over his head with one of those @CAPS5 god skirts. Nope, he was just an ordinary kid who dressed like a skater and was just a real inamorata. He had jet black hair (he dyed it), bright green eyes, and a smile that could shock the whole world.  Signs were going off in my head telling me to be careful but I never listened to them, they only made my life worse. So one day a few of my friends and I were in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 with our teacher for a calligraphy convention when @PERSON2 (my friend) starts text messaging someone. I was a little curious so I asked in a friendly way who it was. @CAPS8 said it was @PERSON1 and my heart seemed to jump. ""@CAPS6 you tell him I say hello?"" ""@CAPS7."" @CAPS8 told him I said hello and he asked if I was really there and @PERSON2 said yes. That's when we actually got to talk to each other more than once a day. We talked all the way back to @LOCATION1. A few months went by and we were back to our old way of talking to each other. He was very kind and never did he have a bromidic moment. He told me about his family (which is a little strange, but I don't judge), his life, his future, what he felt and how he wished he could see me so he could give me a big hug (another of @CAPS3's friends said the same thing but @CAPS8 said he wasn't aloud to). I talked to him about all of it and it was like we understood each other a little bit. I told him about my life but there really wasn't much to tell since my life has always been bromidic. I thought we could actually make things work between us, that is until he moved to @LOCATION2. I was a little upset but it really didn't bother me except the fact that talking to each other became almost as rare as seeing a different picture of him.  While at school one morning @PERSON2 came over to me and had a careful gaze. I asked what was wrong and then @CAPS8 asked if anything could ruin my day. I told her that only going home would and we laughed a little about it. I knew something was wrong and that it had to do with @PERSON1 but I just acted oblivious to it hoping it would lessen the blow I knew was about to come. @CAPS8 said he had told her it wasn't going to work out between him and I. I sat there and like the idiot I was I said I knew it wasn't going to anyways, he was him and I was me. @CAPS8 said he was sorry and all these other excuses but I wouldn't listen. Instead I ignored it and went on with my life like I think everyone should. Of course a few months later he asked @PERSON2 out but I let it go just as @CAPS8 did when @CAPS8 said no to him and they stopped talking to each other. So who ever said laughter was the best medicine obviously hadn't experienced the after effects of it all. "	15	19		34				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	4	4

20908	8	" Have you ever had a fear of falling off of a cliff when up in the mountain? I have, I actually had that experience. It was a @DATE1 @TIME2 @PERSON1 we had just gotten off of the bus. I had grabbed all of my gear from the storage from under the bus @PERSON1 headed for the slopes. we strapped in our boots @PERSON1 went to the lift to catch a chair up. I was with my friends @PERSON1, @PERSON1 all three of us joined the snowboard team at school that year. The three of us caught a chair up to the top of the run. The air was so crisp, @PERSON1 the snow was a fresh blanket of powder. We were all so excited to go ride in that perfect of a @TIME1. As we went down the run, it was the same old usual every @DATE1 @TIME1. so I talked to my friends @PERSON1 suggested that it was time we went through some new trails. They agreed, so we went down through @TIME1 new area. It was a good trail with many jumps @PERSON1 a lot of powder. It seemed like a perfect area to board in. We all enjoyed it very much. But we realized that it was coming to the end when the trail was getting a little narrow, then suddenly, there was a drop right in front of us. I shifted my board sideways so I can stop, but it didn't help. It was a patch of ice that i hit, @PERSON1 it was no use. I couldn't stop. I fell off, @PERSON1 braced for impact. I was thinking that I was about to be seriously injured because of the rocks below. But luckily, my board was the first to hit the rock, showering the cool @TIME1 with sparks lighting it up. I slid down the snow a couple more feet, trying to stop myself. As I came to a stop, I looked back wondering how I survived that. I was worried that my friends would do the same, but they had stopped just in time. We all couldn't believe on what just happened. I learned a lesson from @TIME1 of to always scope out the area first before you go through it. I luckily was not hurt, I could have been seriously injured."	18	17		35				4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	4	4	3	4						
20911	8	"            @CAPS10 @CAPS1 @CAPS9 my @CAPS2! Laughter, you need it to survive in this world. Someone should laugh at least ten times a day. Have you ever heard, it takes more muscles to frown than to smile? Well, I believe that it is true. It's more convenent to be happy than being sad. According to me.  In @DATE2, my family was living in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1. My mom and dad had @NUM1 baby girls, before my brother and I were born. It was a beautiful snowy morning on @DATE1... Christmas! My sister, @PERSON1 in a bright yellow dress was @CAPS13 excited to be getting presents and cake! As soon as @CAPS6 opened a big battery powered monster truck, her beautiful clear blue eyes got as big as watermelons!  @PERSON1 walked over steddily, and climbed into the huge truck. There was only one problem, @CAPS6 couldn't reach the pedals. Everyone stood there, silent... then they started busting up laughing because @PERSON1 awkwardly looked like @CAPS6 was dancing in the truck beacuse @CAPS6 was trying to reach the pedals. Then my mom said, ""@CAPS3 someone should go help @PERSON1 get going on the truck."" @CAPS4 that was probably the worst idea ever!  My @CAPS2 is @NUM2 years old, and about @NUM3 pounds, and not in the best shape. @CAPS6 said annoyed, ""@CAPS5 I'll help @PERSON1."" @CAPS6 rolled up off the couch and stood by @PERSON1 and the truck. My dad was giggling in the background. My @CAPS2 said seriously,""I need a stick or something to push on the ""go"" pedal."" @CAPS6 went and found a long stick outside in the snow. They decided that they should try it outside because @PERSON1 wanted to feel the chilling wind on her baby soft face as @CAPS6 was riding in the truck. @CAPS13 my mom bundled up @PERSON1 in @NUM1 jackets, gloves, and a beanie. Somehow they got on top of a @NUM5 foot snowy, and slippery hill we live on. My @CAPS2 pushed down on the ""go"" pedal and it went forward @CAPS4 the front tires got caught on her long dress @CAPS6 was wearing and ran her over! The next thing we know, @CAPS6 is tumbling down the hill screaming on the top of her lungs! That's when her red flowered dress flew up and we could see her tong. My sister said loudly,""That's gross @CAPS2!"" @CAPS9 just some minor bruises and scratches my @CAPS2 was @CAPS5. That was the @CAPS10 @CAPS1 @CAPS9 my @CAPS2 ever! I watched it on the @CAPS11 video.  We @MONTH1 put that video on the ""@CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12."" @CAPS13 if you see it, just remember me chuckling in the back of her head. @CAPS13 remember, you should always laugh or smile more than frown or be mad. Laughter, is the key to a happy life!"	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20923	8	"            The Element of @CAPS1 and Laughter Laughter is an important element that a person could ever have when they are in a joyful or happy mood. Laughing is a good part in a persons life; it shows other people when you appreciate something that they did that put you in a good enough mood to share a laugh. Some people react in different ways when it comes to laughter because of their emotions; other people laugh to hilarious jokes and other types of people laugh at peoples accidents while others don't. Emotions are a big deal in a persons life. Some emotions are joy, sorrow, jealousy, fear or anger. Being happy makes people want to laugh at something. Sometimes when people laugh too much, they will actually start crying from it. People like other people @CAPS4 are in a happy or joyful mood, because then they can receive those good feelings as well; therefore, it makes other people happy to get more people to be in a positive attitude as well.  Another thing that makes people laugh are jokes. Some jokes can be very funny, other jokes can be gross, and some jokes can be really hilarious that you will always remember them. But jokes can get complicated at times; to a little kid you can say, ""@CAPS2, @CAPS2!"" ""@CAPS4's there?"" ""@CAPS5."" ""@CAPS5 @CAPS4?"" ""@CAPS5 @CAPS4?, don't cry about it, it was just a joke,"" and the kid would be laughing. But to someone @CAPS4 is older, you have to think a little more to get them to laugh. People love laughter; they like laughing at peoples jokes and especially at hilarious pranks. Sometimes pranks really aren't that funny. Like you seeing a friend of yours get something that spits out garlic and them knowing that the person that is about to get pranked is alergic to garlic. But most of the time, funny things help people cheer up when they are down. Furthermore, accidents are some things that can be really horrible at some times, but at other times, some of the accidents that occur in life can be very hilarious to some people. Some accidents people can decide whether to take it one way or the other. For example, a person might think that another person that is about to jump off of a diving board, but then slips and hits his back on the board is really funny and another person could disagree with that and take it in the opposite way and think that it was not funny at all. It is like when someone says that they a really funny joke or something hilarious to say, and you end up thinking that it was something that was bothersome or a tragedy or it could also be the other way around. You might think that you have something funny to say, but then to your friend it was something that really bothered them or something that they thought that wasn't funny at all. In other words, laughter is an important element that a person could ever have in their life. It is a part that a person can help another person when someone needs a good laugh to share with another person. Enjoy having good times with friends to share a couple of laughs, don't just be in a grumpy mood all the time, be happy. Laughter is a good thing; people love it so don't always be serious and at least share some laughs with your friends or loved ones."	13	19	34	34				3	2	3	2	2	3	3	4	3	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	4	3
20927	8	"                                        The @CAPS1 of Laughter Laughter seems to be almost the basis of ones relationship with friends, with no laughter, there is no spark of interest of wanting to be someones friend. When I think of laughter, I think of the times when I go to @ORGANIZATION1. Even @CAPS2 I have had the most horrible day, I know that the girls I play with on that team, who are like a second family to me, can always cheer me up by the things they say or do. The underlying relationship between a @ORGANIZATION1 team becomes unknown to the outside; no one really knows how much we laugh together, or how much frustration builds up between us. Frustration @MONTH1 get the best of us sometimes but I can think of a lot more memories where I was laying on the turf field laughing because a dumb decision of a player, turns into on of the funniest things I've ever seen.  I remember the first time I had a @ORGANIZATION1 practice, back in @DATE1 of second grade, I was playing with many girls who had gone to a different school and I had never seen before. All of the girls decided that they wanted to see who was the best at juggling a @ORGANIZATION1 ball on there knees. It came my turn to try, and as i went to bump it with my knee, it hit in the wrong spot so it came back up and hit me in the nose, leaving it bloody. I had no idea how to react, so I started to laugh. At the time, a girl I had never seen before started to laugh with me, and came up and gave me a tissue. Believe it or not the girl who gave me a tissue that first day became my best friend, and has been ever since. The laughter that occurred that day filled the gap of distance between us. Since that day we have never had an awkward silence wondering what we should say or do.   Entering the fall of fourth grade, I had just joined the @ORGANIZATION1 team @ORGANIZATION1, still playing with the same girls, with the exception of a few people. I had no idea what to think of those people or what to say, so i decided on not saying anything. We had been playing monkey in the middle and I was guarding a short blond girl named @CAPS3, who had extremely good talents but was a little clumsy. She had started to run for the ball, and low and behold the clumsy girl tripped on nothing! Thoughts were racing through my mind; should I laugh? Will she hate me @CAPS2 I do? What @CAPS2 she's actually hurt? Though these thoughts @MONTH1 become reality, I went with my instinct and burst with laughter. She rolled over to see who had starting laughing at her accidental trip, and started laughing as well. After the incident, we got up and started talking, realizing we had gone to the same school but never associated with one another. From that day on we became inseparable at school, and became best friends.  The next story has nothing to do with @ORGANIZATION1, but everything to do with laughter. Though there is no certain story that I could tell you in particular that happened between this girl and I, all I can say is she is the one who gave me the first experience of laughing until you cry. I remember her moving to our school, and I was no longer the ""new girl"". At first, I thought she was the weirdest person that I had ever met, but as time progressed I had come to find out that she @MONTH1 be one of the funniest people I have ever met. @CAPS2 I would have made the realization beforehand that this girl had the personality she did, I would have went up to her in a heartbeat and made friends, instead of hiding behind the crowd. Ever since we became friends our friendship has been based upon how much we laugh together, and I wouldn't have it an other way. In the end the person who once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", was absolutely correct. I used these stories above to show no matter how shy, or awkward a person @MONTH1 be, sharing a laugh with a new person is the easiest way to find a best friend. When I was introduced to laughter by these three people, I started to become more social throughout my middle school years, and now onto my high school career as well. @CAPS2 I lived a life without laughter, I would lose the life I have, and it would be filled with dull memories that are not worth sharing, and to me, that is definitely not worth it. Over the past six years, I have gained three best friends due to laughter, this really does go to show that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and is truly a @CAPS1 to have it."	20	16		36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	3						
20933	8	"Laughter is such a marvelous element to have in any relationship. For instance if you can't find any form of humor in a relationship than I'm pretty sure there is no strong connection between the two of you. For example I was in a relationship once where we didn't have that element of humor, and I truthfully did not enjoy that relationship that her and I had. Any type of relationship needs laughter rather its friendships, boyfriend or girlfriends, and even family. All different types of relationships need some form of humor to survive. Sometimes families don't have that humor for each other but they'll still have that special type of a friendship, the reason for that I believe is because your family will always be there for you unlike most friends would. One way I know this because one of my friends really liked a guy, I could have sworn she @MONTH1 have even loved him, when he told her that he started dating some girl, she had cried for weeks, than when she was at her moms house one of her brothers she believed hated her said he wants to hurt the guy that had made his younger sister cry. They @MONTH1 not of had a humorous friendship, or even a friendship at all, but I believe laughter isn't necessarily always needed especially within family. All types of relationships are like plants, the flower is the relationship and laughter is the water that will help the relationship grow big and strong. But without that water the plant wont grow, just like laughter in a relationship. I know that if I knew someone who I did not find to be humorous I know our friendship would not be very strong, unlike someone who I felt was hilarious. Laughter is always a important element in everyday life. For instance if you are going for a job interview you really need to connect with the person interviewing you and make a good impression for yourself. One way of doing that is through laughter, I have heard of many stories about job interviews, a example of one is my mom had a interview not to long ago for a @CAPS1 job and she told me about her interview and she said they had really connected. Their was also some seriousness and some laughter in that interview than three days later they emailed her and told her that she got the job and that they would love to hire her. and I have heard of interviews where they didn't get the job. My sister had a interview once for a pet kennel type of place where they drop their pets off there while they go on vacation, and she said that her and the person interviewing her had no connection which had led to no humor or laughter. So I believe humor is such a marvelous element to have within a relationship because with laughter comes greatness and happiness."	17	15		32				3	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	4	4	3	3						
20936	8	" A few years ago, when I was @NUM1, I decided to do an experiment on laughing and the color of the clothes people wear. I realized that I laughed a lot and I was almost always happy because of @CAPS11, I did really @CAPS1 in school, and I also had a very 'up' attitude. @CAPS6 clothes were all very bright and 'happy' colors. I had a theory that the less someone laughed, and the darker colored clothes they wore, would make their mood and attitude would dip. The experiment would last one week, and in that time I would try @CAPS7 to laugh and gradually start wearing darker and darker clothes until I got to black, to see how I would be affected, if affected at all. To get started, I had to first tell everyone what I was doing and ask them to try @CAPS7 to make me laugh on purpose. Then I had to go to the store and get new clothes that had no bright colors on them. That was the hardest part because I saw a lot of cute clothes, but they were too colorful. After that i only had to wait for the @DATE2 to end and @DATE3 to begin. @DATE3 @TIME1 I woke up and did @CAPS6 usual daily routine, then tried on @CAPS6 new clothes. When I got to school, I noticed the surprised looks from @CAPS6 classmates @CAPS2 they took in @CAPS6 outfit. @CAPS11 was pretty tough @CAPS7 to laugh at some of their expressions but I couldn't, because that would ruin what I was trying to accomplish. Throughout the day, I got comments on @CAPS6 clothing, and some of @CAPS6 teachers were worried because I wasn't laughing @CAPS2 usual but when I told them of @CAPS6 experiment, they understood and said, ""@CAPS1 luck."" @CAPS2 the day came to an end, I was satisfied with @CAPS6 success and quickly fell asleep. The next two days went pretty much the same, and I was wondering if @CAPS6 theory would be proven wrong. But on @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS6 mom pointed out that I seemed different.  ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 okay?"" she asked. ""@CAPS4 don't seem @CAPS2 energetic @TIME1, and your @CAPS7 smiling at all. Your @CAPS7 sick @CAPS3 @CAPS4?"" I told her that I was fine. At school, I was asked the same thing, and after a while @CAPS11 got really annoying. I got mad and yelled at them, which I never do, and they apologized. But I felt bad and told them I was sorry and they forgave me, telling me @CAPS11 was probably just the experiment. I got a little happier at the thought that @CAPS6 theory might just be correct. That day went by slowly, and I was glad when @CAPS11 ended. @DATE4 was the last day of @CAPS6 experiment and for that I was happy. I didn't mind the dark clothes and I liked the way they looked on me, but @CAPS11 was hard @CAPS7 laughing, and @CAPS11 was starting to make me feel depressed. That day I decided to wear some of @CAPS6 bright clothes to see if @CAPS11 would change anything, and when I got to school some of @CAPS6 friends didn't recognize me because they got used to seeing me in @CAPS6 other clothes. I didn't feel any different from when I wore @CAPS6 dark clothes. In @CAPS5 I had to stand in front of the class to give @CAPS6 conclusion. ""@CAPS6 theory has been proven semi-correct,"" I stated. ""@CAPS7 laughing did have an effect on @CAPS6 mood and attitude. I was yelling at @CAPS6 friends and feeling sad when I shouldn't have. But I found that wearing dark clothing didn't change anything."" @CAPS6 teacher then said something so funny that I couldn't help but laugh, and everyone applauded and said, ""@CAPS9 back @CAPS10!"" @CAPS11 feels really @CAPS1 to laugh again."	18	20	44	44				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	4	4	4
20943	8	"Laughter is the best medicine Many people say laughter is the best medicine. I for one, agree. The reason why is that in many points of @CAPS27 life, laughter has helped me, or others, feel a whole lot better. @CAPS27 mother recently got surgery on her shoulder. @CAPS4 had medicine @CAPS2 all @CAPS34 I think the best @CAPS4 took was three nights ago when I was with her in her room...Doing a word-search.  It was @DATE1 @TIME1. Every @DATE1 @CAPS27 step dad's kids come over for dinner. @CAPS27 mom wasn't really feeling well so @CAPS4 went upstairs @CAPS2 started on her big book of word-searches. @CAPS27 step-sister had recently gotten a new car so @CAPS4 @CAPS2 @CAPS27 step-dad were outside looking at it. I went out for @CAPS19 two minutes then came back inside. @CAPS27 step-brother was on @CAPS27 step-dad's iPad. He showed me this game on @CAPS22 @CAPS2 we started playing. A few minutes later @PERSON2, @CAPS27 step dad, said that he was going to @ORGANIZATION1. Katie, @CAPS27 step-sister, @CAPS2 @PERSON1, @CAPS27 step-brother, decided to @CAPS46 with them. @PERSON2 went upstairs to ask @CAPS27 mom if @CAPS4 needed anything. Then they left @CAPS2 I went upstairs to check on her. I saw @CAPS4 was going her word-search @CAPS2 I started to help her.  I don't remember the name of the word-search @CAPS34 we did several. Since @CAPS4 had already started I was looking over the letters, looking for another word. Apparently I wasn't looking close enough because I swore I saw a word that wasn't even in the puzzle. So I said it @CAPS2 @CAPS27 mom said, ""@CAPS1 me?"" @CAPS2 I started laughing. I repeated myself @CAPS2 we were both laughing. After that wore off we finished the word-search @CAPS2 started a new one. This one was called ""@CAPS3."" @CAPS4 took the book @CAPS2 looked over the list @CAPS2 suddenly said ""@CAPS5-winks! Yeah!"" @CAPS2 I looked at her like @CAPS4 was crazy. Which @CAPS4 was. I looked at the list again @CAPS2 I start laughing really hard @CAPS2 ask, ""@CAPS7's @CAPS8?"" I was saying it wrong @CAPS34 when @CAPS24 were laughing that hard, who wouldn't?  ""@CAPS7?"" @CAPS4 asked @CAPS2 I showed it to her. ""@CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13."" @CAPS4 said @CAPS2 we started laughing. ""That sounds like something the @CAPS15 @CAPS16 would say."" I comment @CAPS2 @CAPS27 mom does the little song from the @CAPS15 @CAPS16 song which made me laugh harder. We barely made it through the end of the word-search. @CAPS34 we did. The next one I think was called ""@CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21"" @CAPS22 were several things on @CAPS22 we didn't know. I asked her @CAPS7 one was @CAPS2 @CAPS4's like, ""I don't know."" @CAPS2 then I asked her another. ""@CAPS24're asking me all the things I don't know."" @CAPS4 said. This word search was kind of funny @CAPS34 only because we were saying the rest of the letters after the actual word which made them pretty funny. I accidentally circled the word ""ear"" because I thought it was on the list. It wasn't. @CAPS34 ""earring"" was. We ended up finding ""hair"" at the end of the ""ear"" I'd circled. ""@CAPS26 thanks for that picture."" @CAPS27 mom said. ""@CAPS7? Ear-hair?"" I asked @CAPS2 we laughed again. When we finished that we went onto ""@CAPS29"". That was a funny word-search. We usually read over the list of words before we look for them. One of the words was ""@CAPS30"" @CAPS2 I laughed @CAPS2 said ""@CAPS26 yeah, I can see someone walking around with a @CAPS30 on their head. '@CAPS32, nice @CAPS30.'"" I said in a weird voice. ""'@CAPS26 thanks. I got it from the @CAPS30 store.'"" I guess I was doing a pretty good job because @CAPS27 mom was laughing really really hard.  ""@CAPS34 wouldn't that be uncomfortable? I mean it's a @CAPS30. I'd think the tail would always be slapping the back of @CAPS20 head."" I said before laughing again. Katie @CAPS2 @PERSON1 walked in the room @CAPS2 looked at us like '@CAPS7 the heck?' @CAPS2 I showed her the word-search. ""@CAPS26, it's not a cowboy hat. It's the full cowboy."" @CAPS4 said, laughing as well. @CAPS27 mom shook her head, trying to say something. ""@CAPS39, @CAPS39, it's things that wear hats."" @CAPS4 managed to get out @CAPS2 I'm looking at her. ""@CAPS7 kind of a hat does a @CAPS30 wear?"" I asked, smirking. @CAPS4 shook her head. ""I don't know."" @CAPS4 said like @CAPS4 was giving up. Katie @CAPS2 @PERSON1 then said good-bye @CAPS2 left. ""@CAPS43, @CAPS39 more. I need to take @CAPS27 pills."" I snorted at @CAPS7 @CAPS4 said. ""@CAPS39, @CAPS24 really don't need any pills."" @CAPS4 looks at me like @CAPS4 was going to punch me. @CAPS4 might have if I wasn't standing a few feet away. ""@CAPS46 away."" @CAPS4 said with a smile. ""@CAPS48."" I said before turning @CAPS2 walking back to @CAPS27 room. I've had several things like this happen. All of them were really funny. They were the humor that @CAPS24 kind of had to be @CAPS22 to understand. I still said laughter is the best medicine. Mom says its @CAPS49."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	4	4						
20953	8	" A while back, I had a friend named @PERSON4. We were best friends; like two peas in a pod. We would hang out everyday, all day @DATE1.  One random day we walked up to our other friend @PERSON1's house to see if she could hang out. We all were hanging out all day when @PERSON1 came up with an idea. She wanted both me and @PERSON2 to stay the @TIME1.We stayed out a little past dark and just walked around @CAPS1. We stopped at @LOCATION1's house so she could get her clothes then left to go back to @ORGANIZATION1. On our way there, we stopped, again, at @LOCATION2's house and chilled for a while. We were there for @CAPS9 @NUM1 minutes just laughing @CAPS9 all the crazy stuff that has happened over @DATE1 already! When we were finally giving hugs to go to @CAPS2's, @CAPS3, @LOCATION2's older brother, smacked @PERSON1 on her butt and told her it was nice. We made fun of her for the longest time for that! Not to mention how @CAPS3 kept talking @CAPS9 that until he moved to @ORGANIZATION2.  When we left, @LOCATION3, @PERSON4 and I were singing to @ORGANIZATION2's new @CAPS5 when some random person stopped and asked for directions. Then I directed him to where he was going and he said, ""@CAPS6 you,"" and drove away. When he had gone, @PERSON4 looked at me and screamed, ""That was the hottest guy I have @CAPS7 seen!"" @CAPS8 @CAPS9 the time we reached the @CAPS10 down the road we saw the guy again. @CAPS8 this time he wasn't so hot. He had a scruffy face and long, brown, straggly hair tied in a ponytail and was dressed like a hobo. I, still to this day, give her crap @CAPS9 it. That was the greatest @TIME1 of @DATE1.  We ended up going to the @CAPS11 @CAPS12 to buy some drinks when @PERSON1 started freaking out @CAPS9 losing her @CAPS5. So we all had to retrace our steps all the way back to @LOCATION2's house, hoping we'd find it. Re-retracing our steps, we came across this guy who tried to help us find it. By then it was probably @CAPS9 @NUM1 @CAPS14'clock @LOCATION4. We finally gave up and decided to head back to @ORGANIZATION1. Before We even stepped foot in her front door, her mom comes darting out and starts screaming at @LOCATION3. So her mom took me and @PERSON4 back to my house @CAPS8 by the time I knocked on the door, because it was locked, and everyone was asleep so we had no where to go. So for that @TIME1 @PERSON4 and I were stuck homeless. We walked around all @TIME1. Almost fell asleep in the laundromat when i remembered that my aunt @PERSON3 was looking at a small, white truck for sale in the @CAPS15 parking lot. The truck had a bed in the back, no, i don't know why, and it sounded better than the hard floor of the laundromat so we crawled in.  It was a tight squeeze, @CAPS8 we managed. Plus it wreaked of dirty socks and pee. It was, for sure, the worst thing 've @CAPS7 smelled. @CAPS8 no doubt was it the funnest @TIME1 I've had with that girl."	16	15		31				3	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
20956	8	"Laughter can be used for many things. One of which can be the important part of a relationship. There are many key parts in a relationship. But, the most important one is definitely the part of ""laughter being the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS1 laughter can cure the emotion of being sad. @CAPS1 it doesn't cure it.   If laughter is the shortest distance between two people then if a guy or girl meets someone they like. For instance, I have went up to a girl before and couldn't figure out anything to do or say. So, I just tried my best to make her laugh. It @MONTH1 have taken a few days of trying really hard to do so. But, in the the end, i was more comfortable asking her out and feeling more comfortable around her and her friends. @CAPS3 I can make her laugh I always feel better about myself because it is never a good thing to see her in a bad mood. Now on some occasions I have made people laugh and it not mean anything. But, @CAPS3 I make my girl laugh then it was totally worth it. Because I can cheer her up from being any kind of sad or angry to making her happy and full of laughter. It @CAPS1 helps with being depressed too. Her being depressed is kinda like a train wrecking off its tracks. It never turns out good. But @CAPS3 she is happy, she can be full of joy, all giddy, and @CAPS1 very spontaneous.  I know @CAPS1 being alone and laughing is good. But you can @CAPS1 get called crazy if you are laughing at nothing at all. The best way to know someone is possibly feeling better is laughter. If they laugh then they can't be mad, sad, or any kind of emotion besides happy, or maybe sarcasm. But sarcasm can be blown off like it is nothing. If I ever try sarcasm to make people laugh I always end up offending them. So I always just be myself around everyone I come around.  So if you ever hear that laughter is the shortest distance between two people. You should know that it is true. Because not only do you get to a lot more place and get to know someone more. But, you can also learn valuable things about life through being closer to more people. @CAPS3 you hear that phrase, ask yourself, ""@CAPS2 I capable of making someone laugh? @CAPS2 I able to pull off laughter and actually be close to someone?"" @CAPS3 you do that, you'll know that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people."	18	18		36				4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	4	4						
20959	8	" When a day is qualified as perfect there are a lot of things that go into making it so. Most perfect days in people's teenage years are in the @DATE3 beyond the stress of school. My perfect day wasn't in the @DATE3, nor was it on a crazy @DATE4 break in @LOCATION2. My perfect day was on a @DATE2 in the middle of @MONTH1 in @DATE1. It was on this perfect day that my friendship with @ORGANIZATION1 was founded. A friendship that is now the best one of all. A friendship that is based on fun times, memories, story telling, and laughter. By @DATE1 I had spent multiple weekends with @ORGANIZATION1. However none were as hot as that weekend in late @DATE4. We decided we needed to cool off and with that said, we set off for @CAPS1. Down the road we went with two redneck boys and a mutt in the truck bed. Arriving in @CAPS1 was peculiar because I was so far out of my comfort zone. It was also peculiar because I hadn't met a single soul @ORGANIZATION1 was about to introduce me to. When I first lay my eyes on @PERSON1, @PERSON3, @PERSON4, and @PERSON2 I couldn't fathom how @ORGANIZATION1 had met them. She is athletic, driven, proper, and intelligent. The boys that shook my hand were into things like big trucks, fishing poles, and a loud country band. I didn't think upon first meeting them that opposites could attract or become fond of one another. As the day progressed I found my comfort zone again. As the hours flew by and jokes and laughs were exchanged, I realized just how similar we all really were. I didn't think that all of the childish things we did that @DATE2 in @MONTH1 would matter to me months down the roads, but they do. When we were running by the dirty creek with black lipstick painted on as war paint and laughing so hard we cried, I realized just how perfect the situation was. If that day wouldn't have brought laughs to my lips and my mind to it's comfort zone, it would have been a day long forgotten. If you go back on every happy memory you have, there is always one common ground. A joke, or even a funny face makes you laugh extremely hard. Every time I drive through @CAPS1 I think about the day when the sun was hot and we sat by fishing poles exchanging laughs. I think about @ORGANIZATION1 and I running through the trees laughing and tripping over our own feet. I think about @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 laughing and pointing as we attempted to go swimming.  After all of the crazy running and swimming we were quite wound up. @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and @PERSON2 asked us to take a walk; so we accepted and off we went into the brush. Within five minutes of our departure, we stopped walking. Our walk had put us on the top of a hill of little round pebbles. I'm not sure what events lead up to @LOCATION1 pushing @PERSON1 down the hill. However, I remember @PERSON1 pulling @PERSON2 down with him. I also recall @PERSON4 sliding down to join the battle. Watching three boys wrestle and play on a hill of sliding rocks was something like watching a movie about the fifties. Nobody was texting or messing with a machine. Around us was laughing and serenity which danced like music around us. The day had no stress and it had the perfect amount of sunshine. It was like something you only dream about. Once you are in a moment like that, where your own little world is pulling you closer, you never want to leave it. When your on the laughing high, you disconnect yourself and for a few brief seconds your life is in it's simplest form. You are simply you, no racing thoughts, no rushing emotions. You are just one person. I never thought that something as small as laughs could create or better a friendship. On that @DATE2 I realized that the laughs shared between @ORGANIZATION1 and I would be the first memory for what was to come. Every event and every laugh that we had that day will be something I think about when I'm doubtful of the world. It'll always be a memory that makes me appreciate living. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS4 that @DATE1 I wouldn't have believed it but laughing made me closer with people I would have otherwise avoided. Laughs and smiles bounded my world into @ORGANIZATION1 and into the world of a few @CAPS1 rednecks. And as of a @DATE1 @TIME1, that has made all the difference."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
20963	8	"                 Laughter at its @CAPS1  Laughter is one ability that everyone in the world has. Not only does it help you make more friends, but it can also turn your day all the way around. The capability to laugh is a huge importance in this world. Without laughter, days would be dull, sad, and somewhat depressing. When I see someone laugh, it brightens my day, makes me smile, and causes me to laugh along with them. By laughing we become happier, learn more about others, and make our bad days better. I have experienced, first hand, the joys laughing can bring after I have had a bad moment, and that is why I believe that laughter is extremely important to have and to keep in your life.  Not everyone can have a great day all the time. Bad days occur, and when they do, seeing one funny incident and laughing about it is what can turn the whole day around and make it great. Many people hear the statement, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" or a statement similar to that one and will never agree with it. Often times we will scoff and disagree completely. It turns out that I used to be one of those people myself. Most days were not the @CAPS1 they could be, plus having to go to school all day long ruined it a little more. People kept telling me that if I laughed once in a while then I might feel better more often, and I @MONTH1 actually have fun when I participated throughout the day. I never believed them, and why should I? How could one action as simple as laughing change the way I feel about everyday life? The possibilities were just to unlikely. I didn't think I'd change my views on it either, until a few years ago.  It started off like any usual day would, not so great. My hair was a mess, my sister @PERSON1 and I could not stop fighting, and my brand new phone broke right as we started our shopping trip to @LOCATION1. I had decided that the day was going to be horrible because so far, nothing had worked out well. As the day went on, nothing worse happened, but nothing better did either. @PERSON1 and I kept traveling around, going to stores, and shopping. Finally, at our last stop we saw a situation occur. As we were sitting at a stop light, waiting for traffic to move, I spotted a strange man sitting across the road all by himself. The man looked as though he had an injury on his foot, and our suspicions were confirmed when he began walking like a hurt penguin would, barely shuffling his feet and bobbing up and down as he moved forward. The sight of this man made me smile, and when I pointed him out to @PERSON1 she started laughing uncontrollably. Then I too, began cracking up. The man with his crazy way of walking had made me laugh had proceeded to turn my entire day around. What I thought was impossible turned out to be the exact opposite, possible. Laughing could bring you closer to others and make your day more amazing.  As a result of my trip with my sister that day, my views and beliefs about laughing were changed greatly. Laughter actually was the shortest distance between two people. Even though my little sister and I were arguing before the funny man came, after we were done laughing about him we realized that in the span of a few minutes we had become closer than ever before. It is crazy to think that one incident can change your mind about some of your strong beliefs, but it happened, and that day is now a memory that I am going to keep with me forever. I'm happy it happened because as a result of it I have begun to think differently about laughter and the effect it can have on certain situations in my life. I now think of laughter as one of the greatest pastimes to have and do it quite often."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20976	8	" Laughter is an amazing thing. Laughter is bilingual. It does not need to be translated or looked up in a dictionary. It is the one form of communication that we all know and understand. Laughter has @CAPS9 boundary.  @CAPS5 was the most taciturn girl in the whole school. In the mornings and during lunch, @CAPS5 would hide in the shadows hoping not to be seen by the world. @CAPS4 @CAPS10 asked @CAPS8 what @CAPS5 wanted to be, @CAPS5 would say invisible. People passed @CAPS8 by without even a glance, thinking @CAPS4 I don't see @CAPS8 than @CAPS5 can't be there. My heart was sad for the poor girl because I knew @CAPS5 needed a friend. Someone that @CAPS5 could talk to, or atleast get a smile from. However, how would I approach @CAPS8? Would @CAPS5 think that I was insane? I knew there had to be someway to get @CAPS8 to talk, or atleast smile. As I walked into school the @DATE1, the hallway was filled with the same hullabaloo as always. Paper air-planes flying one direction and mouths going off in another. I was used to being shoved around and dodging things on my way to class. It was just the fun journey of getting to your @DATE1 period. Finally, as me and my gawky self made it to fourth period, I sat down and began to look for a pencil. As I did so, I noticed someone pulling out a chair @DATE1 to me and sitting down. It was the girl! I didn't even know @CAPS5 had this class with me, let alone sit right @DATE1 to me. I began to be overwhelmed with joy, knowing that this could be my chance. Futhermore, I began thinking of ways I could start a conversation with @CAPS8. I noticed a picture on the front of @CAPS8 binder that someone had drawn. At the bottom was @CAPS8 signature. I asked @CAPS8 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 had drawn that picture. ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS5 said in very quiet voice. My heart was pounding, almost breaking free from my chest. I knew I had to say something more. ""@CAPS2,"" I began, ""I believe @CAPS10 are a very good artist. Do @CAPS10 have any other pictures?"" ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS5 said again, ""however, they are all at home."" ""Is there any possible way that I @MONTH1 be able to see these other pictures of your's?"" I said happily. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS10 would like, @CAPS10 are more than welcome to come over to my house after to school today and see them."" @CAPS5 said in a very joyful voice. ""I would be honored,"" I said. As we ended the conversation, the teacher began @CAPS8 lesson. @CAPS5 was really a nice girl, I thought to myself. I couldn't wait until the end of the @DATE1. When the school @DATE1 came to a close, we meant each other in the foyer. I could tell that @CAPS5 was very excited. I was excited as @CAPS2, because I knew that @CAPS5 was fnally feeling confident with herself; like a baby bird flying away from its nest for the first time. We drove over to @CAPS8 house in my mighty mule of a truck. I became very nervous as we walked to the front door. As @CAPS5 opened it, my pounding heart flew from my chest. The house was absolutely beautiful. It smelled of fresh baked cookies with a hint of cinnamon. I could not believe what was before my eyes. My mind couldn't make sense of it all. @CAPS8 mother yelled from the other room, ""is that @CAPS10 sweetie?"" ""@CAPS1 mother,"" @CAPS5 said back, ""I have a friend over."" ""@CAPS7!"" @CAPS8 mother exlaimed. We enjoyed some cookies and milk with @CAPS8 mother and then we went up to @CAPS8 room. @CAPS8 room was filled with so many beautiful drawings that @CAPS5 had done. @CAPS5 told me that there was a story behind each one of them that inspired @CAPS8 to draw it. @CAPS5 asked @CAPS4 I have ever drawn a picture before. ""@CAPS9,"" I said, ""I am what @CAPS10 call challenged in the world of art."" We both began to laugh; however, we both began drawing a picture. In the midst of it all, I looked over at @CAPS8 picture. It was a beautiful drawing of a fairytale world filled with castles and dragons. Then, @CAPS5 looked at my picture. It was a failed attempt of drawing a simple sunset with clouds and birds. We looked at each other and then began to laugh hysterically. ""@CAPS10're clouds look like potatoes,"" @CAPS5 said. Then we laughed even harder and we continued to laugh for what seemed like an hour. Finally, when i left the house and went home for the night. I realized something amazing, something that I had forgotten. It doesn't take much to reach out to someone that needs a friend. I also realized that it can be the most simple thing that can make @CAPS10 laugh; like a bad drawing. This is beacuse laughter is contagious and we all know that we all love to laugh."	20	22		42				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	4	4	4						
20977	8	" ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" @CAPS3 quote can be agreed by everyone on @LOCATION1. Everyone loves to laugh and have a good time. Especially @CAPS1 with a person you care about. @CAPS1 is something you and another person can do together with ease. @CAPS3 brings two people closer together and brightens a person's life. Some people, like me, are always looking for a guy who knows how to make me smile and laugh. I need to know that arguing isn't going to be the main part of @CAPS3 relationship. Having someone who makes you laugh is a key factor in life. At the age of sixteen I had my first boyfriend. I was the girl who kept on rejecting guys and telling them I was trying to wait for that perfect guy. In the @DATE2 I met @ORGANIZATION2. Even though he was older than me and we might be opposites, he always knows how to make me smile. My first impression of him was his cute smile. After getting to know him and talking on the phone a couple of times I realized that I started to have feelings for @CAPS3 boy. Whenever we talked he always had me @CAPS1. I found @CAPS3 very attractive. Having someone who brings some sunshine into my life made me feel like I was on top of the world. On @DATE1 there was a football game, @ORGANIZATION1 (two schools who are rivals). During @CAPS3 time him and I still weren't dating. That day I invited him to come over so we could watch the game together. I had previously told him how I love stuffed animals. That day he showed up with a fluffy stuffed animal. We were walking around the track, @CAPS2 all of a sudden I tripped. My first reaction was to use my nervous laugh. He had his arm around me and whispered in my ear ""I would never let you @DATE3."" I turned cherry red. From that day on he will remember me as the clumpsy girl who trips all the time. Now that i look back at the day I realize how funny that memory was. Looking back at embarrassing moments is always a good thing in a relationship.  @CAPS2 you are looking for someone who you want to spend the rest of your life together you have to make sure you like them for whom they are. You don't want them to change. The goal is to be able to spend time with someone who you can have a good time with and crack some jokes around. I always tell my friends ""@CAPS1 is a great ab workout."" Which is true because whenever I laugh, my abs are always sore the next day. Being able to have a good time with friends, and laugh about random stuff is always something I look forward to. If there is no @CAPS1 going on, then that means I'm not having a good time. But lucky me, I have amazing friends who make jokes about everything. Whenever I'm around them there is never a moment @CAPS2 I'm not @CAPS1. Being able to make others laugh is a great characteristic in a person.  @CAPS2 you meet a new person, would you rather have awkward silence? Or do you prefer someone who will make you laugh? I'm hoping we have the same answer, because I hate awkward silence. I need to know that @CAPS3 person will make me laugh and smile and not make me be thinking ""@CAPS2 will I be able to leave?"" @CAPS3 is one of the worst situations anyone would want to go through, I can say @CAPS3 from personal experience. Even though I'm not the best at saying jokes, I use all my embarrassing moments and thats my way I have people @CAPS1. I don't get mad about it, I'm the total opposite. I laugh along with them. I know I'm clumpsy, I know I have my moments, and if these things can bring a smile to a persons face, then I'm @PERCENT1 fine with it. My goal is to be able to make people smile @CAPS2 they are down. So instead of cracking a joke, I just remind them of an embarrassing thing that has happened to me. Everyone is unique in their own ways. That's what makes everyone special. Different people have different ways of making others laugh. And once a guy gets a girl to laugh, that's the first sign @CAPS3 guy was meant for them. Having someone who can make you smile is a key factor in life. @CAPS1 means that you are having a good time. @CAPS1 brings people together. @CAPS1 can brighten a persons life. So next time you meet someone, maybe a joke here and there will help you break the ice."	20	22		42				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	4	4	4						
20984	8	"                     LaughterLaughter can change a lot in people,it can bring people together. It can also help with relationships to make the other person laugh is always a good thing. @CAPS2 your with your friends laughter can and will always be there, well i know it is with my friends and I. @CAPS2 your in a relationship or a friendship, @CAPS1 able to laugh with that other person is important because it can make you feel more connected to them,@CAPS2 you have a big group of friends that you just met you can all laugh together that's even better because then you know your getting somewhere.  My best friend and I laugh all the time, @CAPS3 can just look at me in a way I only understand and I'll know what @CAPS3 means, and then we both start laughing @CAPS2 we stand in a big group of friends and we start laughing, they all look at us funny. Then normally we tell them what were laughing about, most of the time they don't get it. My best friend and I are always together,besides school, we are always laughing no matter if its something that happened a day ago or a year ago. My best friend and i have a lot of inside jokes,we only have to bring one time of hanging out and if something funny happened we will start laughing about it again. In a relationship as in having a ""boyfriend"" or ""girlfriend"" one of the plus sides of things are to make them happy, and laugh, and love to be around you. My boyfriend does it to me, no matter if I'm not in a good mood he always tries to put a smile on my face, most of the time it works. @CAPS2 you have a boyfriend or girlfriend you always wanna try and make them happy. That means girls don't get over the stupid little things. Boys don't get mad @CAPS2 they want to hang out with there friends.  The best way to have a relationship with your boyfriend and your best friend is to make sure they don't hate one another, and if they do work it out in a way that you could hang out with your boyfriend one day and your best friend the other. My relationship works out amazing, because my best friend is dating my boyfriends best friend, so we can all hang out if we really wanted to and not fight it's nice to have all of us friends, that way we can go to the coast together and we can go out to dinner as a group. At this time we are thinking about planning a trip to the coast, and going there for a day were not totally sure though.  I think the best way to have a good relationship full of laughter is to make it your all. Just don't give your whole life to your boyfriend or girlfriend cause if you ever break up you won't have any friends, cause they won't want to hang out with you anymore because you left them for your boyfriend at the time. So i always try and tell my boyfriend that with out making it sound the wrong way. Normally the guys understand that you have a life too and it doesn't revolve around them. My friend did that once and @CAPS3 was not happy as all in the relationship,@CAPS3 told me they never laughed together or anything,@CAPS3 was afraid to break up with him though cause @CAPS3 would not have any friends,cause @CAPS3 made him her life.  Laughter can always make you feel better, it'd kinda like a healing process it will always be there, its just a matter if someone can make you laugh. Theirs people that can make you laugh and @CAPS4 and videos and family. @CAPS2 your with someone that makes you happy it is like you full of joy and enjoyment to be around them and you care for them and you feel comfortable around them. If you have struggles and get through them and they still make you laugh and happy you will know that they are the one your happy and can laugh around. Family always makes you laugh weather you don't want to or not, i love my dad he always knows how to make me laugh. "	16	15		31				3	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	3						
21006	8	" People can share many things. DNA, clothes, feelings, beliefs, religion, and laughter. For my sister @PERSON3 and I, laughter is what made our relationship stronger than it ever would. When I was younger it was the typical older sister @LOCATION1 younger sister vibe, frankly we did not like each other at all. Through maturing, entering high school, and being part of the same cheer leading organization we have spent almost too much time together and now it's almost as if we are the best of friends. In the @DATE3 we were together constantly. We would watchJerry @PERSON1, laugh and/or make fun of the people who volunteered to be on the show. We would watch clips of the showSaturday @TIME1 @CAPS1, that's where I introduced her to the character ""@CAPS2"". @PERSON3 and I would talk to each other in the voice that we adapted from ""@CAPS2"" and laugh constantly about @NUM1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 is also where we adapted the ""demonic voice"". We would talk to each other, and our friends in these voices. Both of us still talk like that @DATE1. As we entered high school we had to start driving together everyday to and from school. We would listen to music, make up random dance moves and sometimes I would have to steer if her favorite song came on(she was a very energetic dancer). It was all in good fun though. When we would enter into the school everything would change though and I understood that after about a week. I was the annoying younger sister who couldn't say hi to her in the hall or wave at her when she was around her friends. She wanted to be left alone so she wouldn't look weird. She was a junior then, they always think their the coolest around. Once she was a senior she would say hi to me, she would smile when she saw me, I even talked to her and her friends sometime. We also grew closer once I entered the student leadership class that she was also apart of, we had the same class every other day it was hard not to talk to each other.  The single thing that I believe has made our relationship closer because of laughter was the three weeks she stayed in my room. She decided to ""move in"" when she would wake up in the morning with bug bites on her arms and legs and she would have no idea what they were from. We suspected that she just didn't remember getting them when she was out the @TIME1 before, but then when she wouldn't go out she still got them. We figured out what it was when her friend @PERSON2 came over; she had bed bugs. That @TIME1 I separated the two mattresses I sleep on and made her a bed thinking she would only be there for two three nights tops so my parents had time to disinfect her room. That turned into two three weeks. We spend almost every hour of every day together those three weeks, the only peace I got was in the shower. We would stay up late talking about our day, who we didn't like, who's outfit we really liked that day, what we wanted to do in cheer practice and who could have done better at cheering. If you knew @PERSON3 you would know how scared she gets over a movie so half the time when we were up late I was next to her trying to scare her. It's quite funny to see her reaction. Finally she ""moved out"" and I got my room back though I don't think, even now it feels the same as it did. They say many things about laughter; ""Laughter is the best medicine"" ""Laughter is the shortest distance between people"" ""@CAPS5 two people in a room, they'll be laughing in @NUM2 minutes""; All of these talking about how relationships grow with laughter. I have the funniest, silliest, greatest sister in the world because we can laugh at the same things. We have the same mind people say, we do a lot of the same things, we think a lot alike, and we wear a lot of the same things as well. I am positive laughter has strengthened my sister and I's relationship. I bet if you really look at the relationship between you and someone you're close to, the first memory you think of is a happy moment of you laughing."	20	18	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3
21010	8	" One day I decided to go over to my friend @PERSON1's house. When I went over there we cleaned the pool and i ran from her dad because he was chasing me around with a booger on his finger. This was one of the days that me and @PERSON1 laughed more then ever!  We started the day just laying in her bad and watching a movie on her tiny @CAPS1. I can't really remember what movie is was but it doesn't really matter since we were too busy talking about totally random things.  After the movie was over we went out into the living room to watch @CAPS2 bob because @PERSON1 doesn't have cable in her room. At the time, I had a knee injury so it took me a minute to get comfortable. I got myself situated on the couch and @PERSON1 sat next to me. Her dad came in about @NUM1 minutes later with a booger on his index finger. He threatened to give me booger lip, which is where he puts the booger on your lip, and I got up and tried to run away. I knew if I didn't get away he would really put in on my lip because he had done it before. it hurt really bad putting that much pressure on my knee so I hoped as fast as I could on one leg. I hid in @PERSON1's closet and all I could hear in the background was @PERSON1's laughter and her dads footsteps. I waited in her closet for like @NUM2 minutes and the got out because I could tell the coast was clear. I went back out in the living room and @PERSON1 and I laughed about the whole thing.  After we stopped laughing we decided to go outside and clean the pool. we were in the mood for swimming and the pool had been out all winter so it was really nasty in there. there were tat poles, dirt, some slimy green stuff, parasites and who knows what else. I wouldn't be surprised if there were fish in there. We got in and started scooping all of the water out with buckets. We didn't notice the tad poles until then. We didn't want to throw them out in the yard with all of the rest of the water because we knew that there would dry up and die. So every time we scooped a bucket full of water, we would go through it and get all of them out and put them in a little can that we had saved the tad poles and scooping all of the water out took about @NUM3 and a half hours. after that we went in the house and looked for some pool cleaner and soap. We couldn't find and so we went and got the shampoo. We poured the shampoo all over the bottom of the pool and started scrubbing. That was taking too long and it wasn't very fun so we got the brilliant idea to put shampoo all over our clothes and slide around. I slipped about a dozen times and so did she. It was hard to stay on our feet. We laughed so hard I almost peed myself but I couldn't go inside because I was soaked and I had soap all over my body. After the pool was all spick and span we had to scoop all out the soap and water out again. All of this took about @NUM4 hours but it was really and we laughed a lot. @PERSON1's mom came home from work and was so happy that we cleaned it because it meant she doesn't have to do it.  After my grandpa came to get me, me and @PERSON1 said our goodbyes. I went home and thought about how that was one of the funnest days of my life. Over all, I think on this day I laughed more then ever before."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21021	8	" My @CAPS1 year of high school started off less favorable than most. During the end of my eighth grade year I found that my friends were not as loyal as I believed they were at the beginning of our friendship, and in turn started high school without any. It wasn't all bad because I was able to see things for myself for one of the first times in my life. Of course I sulked but looking back on it now I am appreciative of this time that helped me get to know myself better. However one can't go through life without any friends so I quickly tried to conform to what was considered 'normal'. I had luck from the start, but I was still scorned from being deserted by all the people who I once considered friends and in turn took these recipients as little more than acquaintances. Like most acquaintances we only spoke in class and kept the conversation casual about nothing more than trivial facts. I wanted to have 'real' friends, but I wasn't sure what a real friend was. I suppose that these so called acquaintance considered me a friend though I can never be sure whether or not this is true. So I continued through my days with a person to talk to in each class but no one to sit with at lunch. This circumstance however was made more desirable because my sister still attended the high school at this point.  Her presence made my life slightly easier because I could confide in her and even eat lunch with her. People who have always had friends @MONTH1 not understand, but when you have no where to sit at lunch it can be kind of lonely. Fortunately my sister was always there for me, though she did skip a lot of school. And whenever she wasn't there I could rely on her friends to keep me company. I found that even if I couldn't find my own friends I could always share my sisters. This nomad existence continued until the second trimester of my @CAPS1 year. I had all knew classes and felt as if it was a new beginning and anything could happen, and truly anything I could imagine did.  It started out the same as the trimester before had. I went to my first couple classes and gained more acquaintances like usual and felt as if thing might not change after all. However after five minutes of sitting alone in my apparel construction class two girls walked in and sat at my table. Their conversation caught my attention and held it. I knew that it was wrong to listen to others conversations, but I figured that if they didn't want me to hear they would have spoke quietly. Though I can't recall the actual subject of the conversation now, I remember it was a hilarious topic. Even though I took no part in the discussion, I couldn't help but be overcome with laughter as the two spoke. They then began to laugh so hard which resulted in tears filling their eyes. In turn my eyes also began to fill with tears from the extreme amounts of laughter. One of the two girls looked over at me and told her friend out loud to ""look at her, shes laughing so hard at you shes crying!"" I could hardly stop laughing long enough to introduce myself. Before i knew it we became close friends and it was all due to the amazing powers of laughter that can bring to strangers together into best friends."	20	20		40				4	4	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4

21032	8	"The @CAPS1 is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 great grandmother once told me that laughing adds and extra five years onto your life, she's currently @NUM1 years old. Laughing can bring a new element to relationships; they embark on a journey, whether it be between two friends, family members, or something more. More or less, laughter is an essential piece. Sometimes you feel closer to people because it breaks down that barrier between what defines acquaintance and friends, but that's actually how I met one of @CAPS3 good friends.  The incoming @CAPS11 were participating a traditional ritual (name game) that the high school puts the incoming @CAPS11 through at orientation. They were placing us in long lines that faced each other. For this particular game you had to shake hands and share your first and last name with your partner along with one interesting fact about yourself. Unsurprisingly, everyone found this task ridiculous and embarrassing, but we were able to laugh if off. A whole new feeling overcame the room. That overwhelming and uneasy feeling simply floated away and all because of laughter. It broke that barrier and allowed us to open up. I guess it really is true that ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS4 back some of @CAPS3 best friendships were brought up through laughter. When I joined the cross country team for instance, the whole team unlike most other sports teams was like one big family. We share socks, @CAPS5-@CAPS6, tee shirts, shorts, water, sometimes even our watches, but we've also shared a great amount of laughs. Even while we run we talk to our friends and joke around, but trust that laughing while running is not easy! I think @CAPS3 best memory of it all was when we had our ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9"". The entire team of eighteen @CAPS7 or so met up at @LOCATION1's house about a week before districts. The @CAPS10 had to bring snack foods, @CAPS11 had to bring drinks, and @CAPS12 brought the candy, and the @CAPS13 all chipped in for the ""main ingredient"". That first bit of the @CAPS8 was alright, but all were in anticipation for that hour hand to strike twelve. When it did, we were @CAPS9. The ""main ingredient"" to that @CAPS8 was the toilet paper. We were going @CAPS9 on a tee-pee raid!  The first event was forking the coaches lawn; but not with just any old forks, these forks were special. For some reason the coach had this odd obsession with @CAPS14, so in spite of that a few of the @CAPS7 photo shopped his head onto the bodies of lawn @CAPS14. I was in pure amazement and not laughing was impossible. I don't think I ever could have @CAPS16 up with something so clever.  After that little stop we were onto the main event, the tee-peeing. We tried to tee-pee one of the brother's from the team, but there dad had already been waiting up. The other pair of brother's were next. All the cars slowly approached the culdesac, we lowered the the radios and shut off all the headlights. Just to be safe, everybody made sure to park at least four houses away and left all the doors open for a quick escape. Almost synchronized, everybody threw there first roll towards the the big tree on the side of the house. We kept missing and the rolls were would fall back down and unravel into the street, one could have called us the worst tee-peers ever. Then all of a sudden three figures came bolting @CAPS9 on skateboards with their own rolls of toilet paper yelling, ""@CAPS15! Get back here you forgot something!"". We were being ambushed! Sprinting back, we just barely made it to the cars. Still, something just didn't feel right. There was just this eerie feeling, like being in a horror movie. Then; suddenly, as we began to drive away, something big hit the car. In panic, @ORGANIZATION1 stopped the car and had to get @CAPS9 to make sure nobody had been hit. ""@CAPS16 get your toilet paper!"", a deep voice yelled. All the @CAPS7 started screaming in terror. What was going to happen now? What was even going on? Were we going to be killed? No,and fortunately we weren't killed that @CAPS8! In relief we discovered that it was only @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @LOCATION2, but I might as well have had a heart attack. Instantaneously, the whole group burst @CAPS9 in laughter and I had been laughing so hard that I began to cry. I've ever laughed so much or so hard in @CAPS3 life and I'll ever forget it.  Laughter @MONTH1 not have brought just two people together, but nearly twenty. When districts came and passed, I know everyone was sad to see the season @CAPS16 to a close. It was the @CAPS13 last season and nobody wanted to see them leave; but all the great times we had will never be lost, and bonds are @CAPS2. "	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	4	4						
21033	8	"                            Whats Laughter!How many friends do you really have? What relationships do you have with others? Well, I'm in high school and I usually don't have that many friends. But I have a few and one of my friends @CAPS4 friends with someone that I truly love. (@CAPS1 didn't know that) @CAPS2 year I was a freshmen and i went to the church with some of my friends and their was an @NUM1 grader that fell in the pond/water and I wasn't sure @CAPS20 @CAPS1 was @CAPS3 or not so I end up coming up to him and asked.Me; @CAPS4 you @CAPS3?, do you need some help?@CAPS1 said; @CAPS6, its @CAPS3 I just sprained my ankle.Me; @CAPS3, see you later then.Him. Later thanks for asking though.me; @CAPS9 sure, @CAPS6 problem! The next year when I'm a sophomore I didn't realized that @CAPS1 was going to be their as a freshmen! his name is @CAPS11 I was starting to hang out with him more because @CAPS1 was really funny and sweet.  We went to the @CAPS12 ball together and our other friends were their but i was worried about of some stuffs but @CAPS1 made it butter because at that time i was afraid that my ex was their. @CAPS11 was their to help me and I also didn't know how to dance and their was a song that was on and I didn't realized that i was dancing until @CAPS1 told me that I was so after was dancing with him I end up asking him @CAPS20 I can dance with one of our friends and @CAPS1 said a was able too so me and @PERSON1 ends up dancing and @CAPS1 was their when I needed him. We end up heading outside and I called @CAPS13 @CAPS14 to be picked up. So, in the mean time, we were outside waiting for her. We were laughing at some jokes that we @CAPS15 said to each other. Like one was that @CAPS1 @CAPS15 some thing in his @CAPS15 and acted like that it was a wand of some sort to the school building and @CAPS15 asked like that it was changed to a gingerbread house. Just about a week ago I end up sneaking up behind him and scared him so bad that I end up laughing and @CAPS1 was too. Because @CAPS1 usually doesn't get freaked out like that, and @CAPS1 told me that @CAPS1 is going to get me back and I'm starting to freak out from me not knowing what it @MONTH1 be. @CAPS11 is a great help when i need him!  The thing about laughter in life is that you would need eat ether way your upset or not in the mood.The main thing that was funny from my family is that we prank each other; like my sister would step out of the room and her soda is in the room that I'm in she still @CAPS15 about half of soda in the can their was mustard on the table and she hates mustard form the taste of it but my dad was thinking the same thing that I was wanting to do and that was to put a little bit of mustard in her soda. When she came back to the room I was smiling and my dad was looking at me also my @CAPS17. My sister ends up having some of the soda and she was looking at my @CAPS14 and was like;@CAPS16, who put mustard in my soda? My @CAPS17, @CAPS18, @CAPS14 and myself was laughing and she hates mustard!, @CAPS20 it was something that I didn't like and that was put in my soda I would've done this too. So, mostly I'm trying to say is that their is some laughter that is funny. not all laughter is not funny. Its butter @CAPS20 you don't prank people that is close to your heart because they @MONTH1 get mad at you. Like my sister, @PERSON2 was mad at me when it wasn't me it was my dad's idea."	12	15		27				3	3	4	3	2	2	3	3	3	4	3	3						
21044	8	" I believe laughter brings many different people together. In my friendships with friends we are always laughing about random, silly, things that happen to us each day. Laughter is an important part of any friendship or relationship. One time when laughter help me out the most was the during fourth grade. Fourth grade had brought so many ups and downs with it which none of us knew it would. My friends and I had the biggest fight over the littlest reason. This fight included my best friend @PERSON2, also my neighbor, @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. We all were very close until this fight which was over my favorite sport, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Everyone had their sides, @PERSON4 sided with @PERSON2 and I was all alone. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 didn't side with anyone they just wanted us to get along. It was the hardest for @DATE2 and I because we were best friends and did everything together. All the students in our class knew that and could not believe we had a huge fight. @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 would try as hard as possible to hang out with both of us but somehow it didn't seem like that to @LOCATION1 and I. We both thought that @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 were never hanging out with us.  Soon enough our teacher and student teacher had called our parents to tell them about this fight. I remember every other day someone would go home crying. Our parents had a meeting with our teachers and principal to discuss how they can help us. They concluded with the fact that @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I would being going to see a councilor. @PERSON3 on the other hand got out of seeing the councilor. We found this out when our teacher announced it to the whole class. As @PERSON1 remembers it ""That was the first time, in a long time, you and @PERSON2 actually talked!"" @CAPS3 @PERSON2 or I remember talking but I guess change had start to come. When we went to the councler she was very nice and talked to us in a way we all felt comfortable. She asked us what we missed most about our friendship and all three of us answered laughing. We said that we laughed every day and now we go home crying. She asked us if we liked to play games during the times we used to spend together, we answered yes. She let us play games, such as monopoly, which was really fun. At the end of the day the three of us went back to class smiling and laughing. When we entered the classroom everyone was surprised that we were actually getting along. After school I went home and my mom asked me how the councling session had gone. I smiled and said we all had a blast! The next day the three of us went back to the councler and played more games. This session also we would be writing a paper about how the fight had changed us. When we were done writing, all of us read the paper to one another. All having the same message: I wish this had never happened, I miss the laughing, and I will laugh about this fight in the future.  To most extent this message was very true. @DATE1, @PERSON1, @PERSON2 and I are still best friends. Yes, we tell this story to everyone and laugh every time. Most of our friends reactions are shocking because they cant believe we had a fight or they just laugh at how stupid the fight was. Most of our friends ask what the moral of the story was and we simply say ""don't let any little thing get in the way of your friendship and remember to laugh about the good times."" In most ways laughing about this silly fight has brought all of us closer and kept us together. Now we have more and more things we can laugh about.  Every friendship has its ups and downs and along with those comes laughter or crying. In the end the only way that you and your friends can be closer is to laugh. Never miss a moment or second guess a change with your friends. They are always going to be with you along the journey of life and laughter is the key."	20	18	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3
21045	8	"Benefits of laughter Laughter has always been a big part of my life. when you laugh you are having fun. Having fun puts you in a good mood. When my friends and I get into arguments, or disagreements laughter can be our mediator. Laughter can make a bad situation slightly bearable. Laughter even has great health benefits like working out your core, and lungs. One of my best friend's mom recently passed away right before @CAPS1. Her name was @CAPS2. She was like a second mother to me for several reasons. I had known her for @NUM1 years, and for a small amount of time i even lived at her house. She was basically a mother figure to me, because i don't live with my birth mother. I use to see her almost everyday, because of my friend @PERSON1. He is @NUM2 and we hang out just about every day. I remember the morning he called me and told me his mom was dead on the floor in her bedroom. I ran over there as fast as i could when i saw the ambulance lights. My other friend @PERSON2 spent the @TIME1 at @PERSON1 house the @TIME1 his mom died. When i made it to @PERSON1's house he instantly started to cry on my shoulder. It was wise not to try and make @PERSON1 happy with laughter, because nothing is really funny when a loved one passes away. As time went on @PERSON2 and I started to think of ways to cheer up @LOCATION1. We wanted to get his mind off of his mother. Wouldn't you know it the best way to do so was laughter. I'm the jokester in my group of friends. So some how i have the ability to make people laugh without thinking. I'm more of a doer not a thinker. Id rather see my friends in a good mood than in a bad mood. If people are in a bad mood there is this bad aura or vibe you can just feel it. Its a very undesirable feeling. Laughter cheers up my friends when they are feeling down. Laughter helped make a bad situation like my friends mom dying into a slightly more comfortable situation. Laughter along with trust, and respect are @CAPS3 bring my friends and I together."	18	19		37				4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4						
21051	8	" One of the most oddest things in life is how people can have different ways of doing things for just about anything. @CAPS1 what I see most is laughing. There is that laugh you do when you don't really understand your bosses joke and then there is that laugh that you do when it really isn't the ""right time."" @CAPS1 one of my favorite is laughing at your best friend when your crying. Sitting on the train a few weeks ago, I saw a lady with her friend sobbing about how her boyfriend just recently broke up with her. Quietly turning over my shoulder I try to hear more of the story. Her friend nodded and comfort her. @CAPS1 then said something about how gross it was when he ate. Sort of like a cow eating grass. As soon her friend said this the girls face blushed and she giggled with laughter. @CAPS1 still her eyes were red as she sniffled a little. @CAPS1 a slow smile washed over her face. The woman had more of giggle then a laugh. @CAPS1 you could tell the girl was going to be okay because she had someone to make her laugh and remember life is more then just a guy. I thought for a second how this happens more then you think with my best friend. I feel like now even that seven years have gone by it never gets old when we bust out laughing. Most of the time it's something stupid and we are just strangely thinking the same thing. @CAPS1 then there's other times where it will be like the lady's behind me. One of us is upset and we know the perfect thing to say to each other. Friendship is like that. And laughter is the medicine to any problem.  After watching the two woman I turn in front of me seeing now a teenage boy and girl. The girl looks slightly nervous as she keeps smoothing her skirt out. Then the boy who keeps shaking his knee up an down. And you can tell he's trying to think of something to say while he keeps taking quick sips from his water bottle. The girl finally pointed out the window and said something about when she was a girl she would play soccer there. He looked where she was pointing and said he thought he maybe played baseball there one time. She nodded her head and they got silent again. The train came to it's next stop jerking a little making the boy spill some of his water on his pants. The girl quickly pulled some tissues out of her purse giving them to the boy. His cheeks flushed with red as he started to chuckle and explaining how nervous he was and this wasn't going to help. The girl stared at him and quickly started to smile. Then they both began to look at each other and started to laugh. The boys laugh was deep and echoed across the train the girls was contagious @CAPS1 sweet. Now the ice had been broken because of one awkward moment and had them both talking and laughing. This was the start of could maybe be even young love. I smiled and rested my head on the window. Watching the trees blur by. I knew how our world is always talked about being so melancholy @CAPS1 I think people forget moments like this. It's those brief seconds with another human relating to you. Making you laugh and caring enough to try to make you feel better that keeps our world from completely going insane.  The train slams and starts to slow down as it comes to a stop. I slouch my bag on to my shoulder and get off the train. As I step outside I feel the cool air kiss my cheeks. I looked around see people hurry by me looking for their next bus or person to pick them up. I sit down on the bench and watched the teenage couple holding hands as they walk by me. As they smile and talk everything suddenly goes dark. I throw my hands up to my eyes connecting with another big cold hands. I snap around to see the person who had blinded me. It was my dad smiling ear to ear. I stood up on the bench and hugged him as I started to laugh. My laugh was high pitched @CAPS1 muffled in my dads coat. This was the best type of laugh to me. No action was funny or a friend saying something @CAPS1 because your so happy sometimes you just have to let out a little bit of joy. You just laugh, not for any reason @CAPS1 because your happy. And then in that second everything bad or what you stressed about goes away. Maybe just for a little awhile @CAPS1 it's still something that could make your whole day better."	27	18	42	42				6	5	6	6	6	5	5	3	5	4	4	3	6	5	6	5	4	3
21054	8	"Laughter is the @CAPS1 @CAPS2't @CAPS6 frustrating when you can't manage to get someone to laugh? Is @CAPS6 really possible to be so upset that you can't even crack a little smile? There's something to laugh at in every situation, sometimes @CAPS6 just takes some thinking and imagination to figure out what @CAPS6 is. I personally had an experience where laughter was all I could look to in order for me to feel like everything was okay. Last @DATE1, I was babysitting, @CAPS6 was a nice and sunny day and we were all craving chocolate frostys from @ORGANIZATION1. At the time I could not legally drive anybody outside of my family, so we decided to call my sister, @LOCATION1. She had the day off work, so @CAPS6 seemed to be a perfect day for frostys. We waited for what seemed like forever for @PERSON2 to get to the house and finally, after about an hour, she pulled in the driveway. The kids were so excited. The four of us loaded into the back of @CAPS4 car and off we went to @ORGANIZATION1. When we got there, we started getting out of the car and that's when I noticed something was wrong. @PERSON2 had just locked the keys in the car, with the keys still in the ignition and the car running! I was still getting the kids out of the car so you'd think that I would just reach in and grab them, but no, that was not the case here. I asked @PERSON2 ""@CAPS3 did you leave your car running? Aren't you going to get your keys?"" @CAPS4 response was, ""@CAPS5, no! I locked @CAPS6 too! Don't close your door!"" @CAPS6 was too late. I instinctively closed the door after i was done. I hadn't really thought about the fact that I could have saved all of this from happening, especially considering that I was the one that noticed @CAPS6 first. Apparently I don't listen to people's responses after I ask them a question because the kids were all practically rolling on the ground because they were laughing so hard and I couldn't figure out what was so funny. Then @CAPS6 hit me, I felt like an idiot. We were stuck in the @LOCATION2's parking lot with three kids, locked outside of a car that was running and we didn't really know what to do from there. Our first solution to the problem was to call my mom and have @CAPS4 bring the spare @CAPS1, but we weren't really sure where the spare @CAPS1 was at the time. My mom said that she didn't have @CAPS6 so we would have to call my dad and ask him where @CAPS6 was. We called him and first he laughed at us for being so stupid, but then said the @CAPS1 was in his truck and somebody would have to come get @CAPS6 from him because he was about to go into a meeting. Obviously we couldn't go get @CAPS6 from him, so we called my mom back and she agreed to go get @CAPS6, though at this point she wasn't very happy about having to leave work to fix our stupidity. She told us to not worry about the car, nothing was going to happen to @CAPS6 with @CAPS6 locked, and just go inside @PERSON1's and get our frostys. Through all of this @PERSON2 and I were just trying to keep the kids entertained, but they didn't really need us for that. They were too busy role playing me closing the door while @PERSON2 said not to. They thought @CAPS6 was hilarious. @PERSON2 and I were not so humored by @CAPS6, although we did think @CAPS6 was pretty funny to watch them exaggerate the whole thing over and over again. Instead of us making the kids laugh, they were making us laugh. We sat at @LOCATION2's for almost two hours before my mom showed up with the @CAPS1. @CAPS6 turned out that the @CAPS1 was not in my dad's truck like we thought, @CAPS6 was at our house, hanging on the board with all of the other spare keys. That didn't matter though, all that mattered was that we get the kids back home before their mom showed up with us not there. The car sitting there using up the gas with nobody in the car was not the funny part of the day, neither was @PERSON2 blaming me for everything and making me fill @CAPS4 tank with all the money I had earned that day from babysitting. The funny part was the kids. Still today, they laugh about our little @PERSON1's adventure. @CAPS6 just makes me realize that @CAPS6's all kids that bring laughter to the world and encourage happiness in everyone. I believe everybody needs a little laughter in their day, even if they think @CAPS6's the worst day ever. Laughter really is the @CAPS1."	20	23		43				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	4						
21061	8	" It was my thirteenth birthday. I woke up on a sunny day which was odd for @ORGANIZATION1 because it was late @DATE1. I got up with excitement. I ran to the kitchen where my parents were. My dad asked me if I wanted to go to work with him and i said yes. My dad is a roofer so i couldn't go on top of the houses because i was to young. I had to stay on the bottom and pick up trash that they would throw. I was doing that for a while, then i got my soccer ball out of my dads truck and i started running around kicking the ball. As i was running i noticed this slippery spot. I had in mind not to go there but i forgot and i stepped on the slippery spot. i fell but while i was falling some how i kicked the soccer ball and it hit the wall and it came back to hit me in the face. My dad and uncles were laughing their lungs out while i was turning red and embarrassed. They were telling me how funny it would be if it was slow motion.i was so embarrassed i put the ball back in my dads truck and i went back to work. The sun was coming down, and we were heading home. we arrived at my house and i walk towards the house door and i opened it and i hear ""@CAPS1!"" @CAPS2, i looked around and my friends and family were there. the reason my dad took me to work was because my mom was going to throw me a @CAPS1 party.i go and say hi to my family and friends. Then i went to go take a shower, iwas in the shower putting soap when all of a sudden the lights go out. I got scared and screamedas loud as i could. I ran out of the bathroom. Went to the the living room and the lights turn back on. My family and friends looked at me and started to laugh. In my head im thinking why are they laughing at me? I looked down and im naked. Everybody was laughing and enjoying the moment, while i was turning pitch red and about to cry. I ran to my room, i put some clothes on. I went back to the living room and i enjoyed my party."	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	3						
21064	8	"@PERSON1 of laughter     Once upon a time there once lived a girl named @PERSON1. The year was two thousand and fourty eight and there were only a few people that were alive after @DATE1, thats @CAPS7 the world ended. @PERSON1's friend @PERSON2 was a huge @CAPS1 freak. She would, by herself, make funny vidoes and put them on @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. One day she was so bored that she went and sat in front of her computer camera and made an "I'm a @ORGANIZATION1" video. It was the funniest thing @PERSON1 had ever seen. She was wearing a a @ORGANIZATION1 hat that was part of the @CAPS1 uniform, and was wearing a @CAPS1 shirt with some of the known characters. @PERSON2 was singing, "I'm a @ORGANIZATION1. I'm a little @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. I'm slitherin' slitherin' in the garden, snatching me up a mouse, a mousey mouse. I'm going to move my tongue to taste you." @CAPS7 she was finished she posted it on the web site. @PERSON1 showed all her friends what an epic faliure that video was, @PERSON2 of course loved it and so did @PERSON1.      Once the video wasnt that cool or funny anymore, which that took about two point five days, no one really watched it and no one really laughed about it, which it was made for that purpose. But @CAPS7 someone would watch it for the first time they would go to school, laugh their butts off and feel like an idiot because everybody had already watched it, and they didnt think it was funny anymore. So from then on people called this kid all sorts of names, but the one that really stuck was @ORGANIZATION1. Eeveryone in @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2's friend group all laughed and @CAPS7 @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 didnt laugh, their friends would call them losers because they weren't laughing at the kid who was getting teased. Laughing @CAPS7 someone is being teased isn't funny. The reason why people laugh and put down others is because they are insecure about themselves and it's not a laughing matter.       @CAPS7 people watch the video of @PERSON2 saying she was a @ORGANIZATION1, that was made to make people laugh and to think was funny, @CAPS8 didn't make the rude words people say to be used to put others down.      Laughing is a key thing to a conversation but also it's healthy for people to laugh. @CAPS7 others see that people are getting made fun of, it's not a time to laugh at them, it @MONTH1 be funny in some case but, put yourself in that persons shoes, feel what they are feeling @CAPS7 people say rude and hurtful things, people could stop the people who are throwing out put downs and stand for the ones who are getting their feelings hurt. Laughing was made for things that are actually funny. Say you walk down the street, on a sidewalk, and you walk by these punk kids who think they are the bown diggity, and they are poking sticks and throwing bottles and trash on at a homeless man with his dog, while the man is on the ground in pain from thses kids kicking him to where he cant move, are you just going to walk by and laugh because you think it's funny? No @CAPS2 not, @CAPS2 going to walk, or run, over to the poor man and see if he is oaky, then you maight call the police and see if they can find the kids who did this to this poor old man. See laughing at people who are down because of words or getting beat up isn't right and peeple need to stop, this is a world that if you are the last few people on the planet, and they have known about you laughing at others pain, do you really think that they are going to help you, or just walk by and laugh like you have? People are cruel in this world and we all need someone that is going to help us if we are hurt or down because of hurtful words.      One way you benefit from laughter, you feel good and you have people that will help you in the time of need, if you laugh about the right things. Tell @CAPS2 friends that if they laugh at peoples pain and anger, that one of these days no one is going to be there to stand up for them. You could be the change we have in schools, in work envirnment, in life in genral, be the change for @CAPS2 kids and grandkids, for @CAPS2 future friends, for the future world."	20	18		38				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4						
21065	8	" When we look back on the past, everything seems to have had a deeper meaning. When we grow older, however, we see the world with new eyes. We see the truth, harsh, stripped of the glossy film that hid it. Laughter helps us see the joy once again, to remember it is there. When is the last time you got lost in laughter? Studies have shown that laughter releases feel-good chemicals in the body. It can add years to a life because, believe it or not, our bodies like to be happy. Laughter is a highly addictive and contagious drug and the best part is that it is free, legal and healthy! Laughter makes us feel better in times of need and brings us closer together. Through whatever is happening in our lives, laughter is one of the only things that can distract us from the pain and stress. As life gets more and more complicated as we grow older, we find that laughter is harder to come by, but no less needed. I remember a time when I was excited every day to go to school. I loved to arrive at the familiar classroom and see everyone who made my days brighter. We would tell jokes and reminisce of fond memories and in the process would make brand new ones for the future. Life was simpler, the worst of our worries surrounded the desperation to be older, to shed our youth and step out of the powerless shells we were imprisoned in. Of only we knew what that really meant. Smiles were not hard to come by and we all enjoyed the simplicity that our lives had to offer. Through all the memories and laughter, I began to realize that love existed aside from movies and family, the love that you find for a friend that you treasure. Laughter was the key variable, revealed in understanding my relationships. When you learn how to fall deeply in love as a kid, that patience and trust can get you through ever day of the rest of your life. All we need to do is to is remember not to forget. The simplicity of childhood is what makes it so precious. Unfortunately as we all grown older, the future looms over our heads, casting a shadow over the things we cherish. There is a predetermined way we are supposed to live our lives that for some reason, erases the plausibility of our true aspirations. Laughter gives way to sighs and tears while dimples are forgotten and replaced with furrowed brows. Everything in adulthood orbits around the office and is held to a nine to five obligation. Businessmen walk past looking like identical mindless penguins. Where did all the fun go? It seems that the pleasure is evaporated with every passing day. We no longer get to know our colleagues around a circle of carpet squares. Instead we are confined to our felt paddock and swivel chair. All the stress makes us forget to laugh, but we simply can't forget. Laughter is the amnesia that makes the cubicle into a fort and the chair into a rocket ship that will take us from our fort to follow our dreams.  So when is the last time you got lost in laughter? Make it now. Take the pen and turn it into a quill. Step out of your cubicle and find the world that you enjoy. Laugh every day because life is too short to forget."	25	22		47				5	5	5	5	5	5	5	4	4	5	5	4						
21068	8	"  Sence I was a little girl I' ve lived without my bio mom, @CAPS1 gave me up for adaption when @CAPS1 was only @NUM1, @CAPS1 wasn't ready @CAPS8 be a mom. @CAPS1 has always been a risk taker an never thought about her concequences. My adoptive parents have always been truthful @CAPS4 me about her an why @CAPS1 gave me up. I accept how my life has turned out an im very grateful, @CAPS2 i wasn't adopted i wouldnt have gotton @CAPS8 know my @PERSON1, The most loving, adventurous, funny, wise women you would ever meet. As soon as i could walk @PERSON1 would have me out camping and hiking @CAPS4 her. @CAPS2 @CAPS6 was a nice sunny day no one would have any doubt were we would be. @CAPS2 we were at @PERSON1's house in the @DATE1 or @DATE2 we would always be out in her garden boy how @PERSON1 @CAPS3 her gardens and flowers. No wait thats a lie @PERSON1 @CAPS3 nature period.  @CAPS1 has taught me how @CAPS8 appreciate everything around me exspecially nature, @CAPS4 me an her we are closer then anything you could think of, @CAPS2 shes the sky im her stars, @CAPS2 i' m a bird @CAPS1's my wings. @CAPS6's that simply. @CAPS6 hasn't always been easy for her an me, but the way we know how @CAPS8 cope is @CAPS8 laugh at everything an everyone, not in a bully or make fun of kind a way, but a good way. Laughin for me an my @PERSON1 comes like a second nature @CAPS8 us, @CAPS6's what keeps us going an know that everything will be okay. A few months ago my favorite cousin @CAPS7 had passed away, @PERSON1 and I had barley seen each other in a while or had talked, but then everything happend so fast @CAPS4 @PERSON2. That when we saw each other @CAPS6 was at his funeral. My sizemore family was all there, even tho @PERSON2 was gone he had a presence that was still there. That night after the funeral everyone went @CAPS8 my aunties house an just spent time together. Finally @PERSON1 and I got the chance @CAPS8 talk yes we were both teary eyed but we were laughing @CAPS8.We were laughin at all the funny times we had @CAPS4 @PERSON2 an all the crazy things he did. One time he had went @CAPS8 go get my uncle from the airport an he was waiting there in his elvis costum holding a sizemore sign..Boy was @PERSON2 a goof.  @PERSON1 was just telling me all these things, and @CAPS6 was then that i relized @PERSON1 had tought me something else @CAPS8 appreciate. @PERSON1 had taught me how @CAPS8 appreciate laughter at a time @CAPS4 sorrow. @CAPS8 rejoice in a time of dealth, @CAPS8 have hope when you felt like you had none left. I learned that even tho people might not think so, laughter is the key medicine @CAPS8 everyones pain. People don't think of laughter as a cure they think of @CAPS6 as something you do after you hear a joke. Laughter is so much more then people give @CAPS6 credit for. My @PERSON1 taught me all those things, plus the real meaning of laughter, and that will always be @CAPS4 me."	20	18	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3
21069	8	"Laughing is one of the things we do best. @PERSON1 and I talk almost everyday and never get tired of laughing. We talk about everything and even if it is the saddest thing in the world we will be able to make it funny in a way, it's just one of those things we do. As best friends it's our job to make each other feel better, and if one calls the other crying it's their job to make the them laugh and if it is funny for both @CAPS2 know it was a job well done. In @DATE3, my uncle died, I called her crying my eyes out, she said, everything was going to be okay and to just think of all the good memories I had of him. One of the only ones I could think of was the funniest story of my life and even though I was still crying, through those tears there was laughter and I knew my uncle would want me to laugh and he was right there laughing with me.  @PERSON1 and I met @DATE1, at @ORGANIZATION1, where we spent a week out of our @DATE1 to get to know new people and getting closer to @CAPS1. That week was one of the funniest weeks out of my whole @DATE1, though me and @PERSON1 didn't ""click"" at @ORGANIZATION1 that week, we later found out we were more alike then we thought. Some people say when two people are to much alike the friendship doesn't work. Well, this is true yet false. When @CAPS2 are alike @CAPS2 can talk to each other about everything, yet when @CAPS2 hit those differences, and the other disagrees it starts a fight, but fights just bring people closer together.  Even though me and @PERSON1 don't see each other much, doesn't mean we can't be best friends. What if your best friend lived in a different state, does that mean they aren't your best friend anymore? No, it just means @CAPS2 don't see them as much as @CAPS2 would like to. Even though we live close to each other we don't always have time to see one another, but, when we do finally get to see each other there isn't a dull moment. About a month after @PERSON1 had gotten in a bad car accident, we went to skate world, @PERSON1 was on crutches so she couldn't skate, but that didn't stop her from having fun and making the @TIME1 full of laughter. She was up dancing to the music, on top of seats yelling, ""@CAPS2 wont ever see these people again in your life, why not just have a little fun? "". By the @DATE2 @TIME1 she got almost everyone in our group dancing up on the stools and I don't regret one thing that happened that @TIME1, it was the most I had laughed in about a year. We were dancing and screaming for about three hours, before one the parents got their and after that we all went home. That is a @TIME1 I will never forget. A girl that was recovering from a horrible car accident made the best out of what she had!  When things don't work out the way we wanted, we just go on with life wishing that it had happen differently, but when we look back a couple years down the road we will see that it was just fine, and it @MONTH1 just make @CAPS2 laugh. somethings are hard to laugh about, but a good thing to do when @CAPS2 get to that point is think of something happy, or funny and try to laugh. Laughing has always made me feel better, and knowing that I can make someone with a difficult life laugh until they are about to pee makes me feel good. It makes me feel like I have done something good with my life that I was willing to help @PERSON1 with her struggles. To me that makes this life, a life worth living. Though @CAPS2 cant help everyone through every single one of their struggles, just being there sometimes helps them more then @CAPS2 @MONTH1 know.  @PERSON1 and I have planed out many lives we would like to live and looking back now on them all I can do is laugh, because in my heart I know they will never happen. Even if we try our best to make them happen I doubt they will. But, it was worth the laughter and a good time to make them up, and Believe they were going to happen for awhile and I know looking back in a few years we will both laugh. Laughing is a good way to get rid of fear, anger, and stress. It makes @CAPS2 think of all the good times @CAPS2 have had in your life, and lets @CAPS2 know that @CAPS2 had fun in your life. Though we fight, in the @DATE2, I don't think anyone will be able to tear @PERSON1 and I apart, with all the laughter that is done. We are true friends."	19	24	42	42				4	4	4	4	3	4	5	4	6	5	5	5	5	4	5	4	4	4
21075	8	" Side by side with my best friend @PERSON1 we begin to walk to the park. The rained on @DATE1 @TIME1 wasn't very pretty or warm but the pleasures of watching lost and the hopeless at this particular park in @LOCATION1 was enough for us. Approaching the grass to the benches, mud was dominating my shoes when I was starting to think other wise of such fun. Sitting on the damp leaf filled benches we notice a man and his child walking toward us. Although this man was quite odd looking we quickly grew excited for what he had to say to us was more than likely going to match his appearance.  The fellow looked to be in his late thirty's with tight pants covered in what appeared as sharpie written all over him. A knitted scarf and with a small hat to match he had this flaming homely look about him. Beside him, a stroller with two small children, one at hand while the other lounging in a storage pocket below. The father we later find out, pretends his @NUM1 year old daughter is whispering in his ear, shouting things like ""@CAPS1 WAS THAT""?! suggesting he hadn't heard her although we knew she hadn't said anything at all. ""@CAPS2 want me to ask the girls if they want any raisins, is that what @CAPS2 want""? odd enough we look the raisins bushing them between the cracks of the benches on the few times he looked away. @PERSON1 an I then look at each other when he starts ranting how beautiful and striking her eyes were. The laughter was watering out of our eyes and being under such pressure to redeem, it was wanting to burst out of us both. The man then take out his phone with a video of a country singer compare their faces toward one another.  Minutes into the video I look away since the phone was now in @LOCATION2's hands. I feel her nudging me from leaving her even just with my eyes and hadn't continued suffering with the ridiculous video. Looking up I see the father staring at her as if waiting for some kind of reaction. Back to @PERSON1 I notice how uncomfortable we all were including his kids and he hadn't even a clue. throughout this whole interaction I hadn't said more than @NUM1 words in between the silent laughter and looking always that I couldn't control. My persistent friend who also hates being impolite then hands over the phone with a smile on her face and cheeks of red. ""@CAPS2 really look just like her @CAPS2 know""? All these questions he had for us and no answers but laughter prancing inside us. The boiling silence was rising between us and very little we could handle next. Pulling out a script the man then asks to see our acting skills and would like to direct us sometime. Once he spilled those beans on us we jolted directly toward her house while pouring out our enormous amount of laughs being held in and effecting our ability to talk. breathe by breath running I could finally speak causing me to blurt how i could hardly fathom the reality of his request. Just another day in @LOCATION1 we thought, but for us everyday was just something to laugh about."	20	15		35				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21087	8	" One day is was almost @CAPS1 and my sister, my mom, and I were all in the kitchen making desserts and a bunch of food for @CAPS1 eve dinner. My mom had to leave and go to the store to get more ingredients. Once my mom left my sister and I were still busy working away in the kitchen. I was working on one thing and she was working on another. Finally she was done with making the cookies and decided to help me with the lemon blossoms ( little lemon glazed cakes). The directions called for a fourth of a cup of lemon juice. @CAPS4 i told my sister to get the lemon juice out of the lemons. At this point in time I am making the little cakes, my sister yells at me and asks "" do I just squeeze @CAPS3?"" and I thinking she cut @CAPS3 says yes. Well I was wrong my sister yells at me again and says "" @CAPS3 isn't working."" @CAPS4 i turn around to find her squeezing an un-cut lemon trying to get the lemon juice out of @CAPS3 I just looked at her told her she needed to cut @CAPS3 and started laughing. I don't think I have ever laughed that hard. As I am on the floor crying because I am laughing @CAPS4 hard my mom comes into the kitchen with a bag full of grocery's and the first words out of her mouth were "" @CAPS5 did @CAPS6 do."" @CAPS7 if you can believe @CAPS3 i started laughing even harder. Also my sister to this day is still called lemons. This is because my family and I thought @CAPS3 was @CAPS4 funny that all of our family and friends should know about this little experience my sister had with lemons. From this experience i have learned that laughing is important in @CAPS4 many ways, @CAPS3 can bring friends and family closer together, @CAPS3 can make any relationship stronger. This experience in the end made my sister and I a lot closer in many ways and now we always laugh together and I would rather laugh than fight with her. My sister and I since this incident have become @CAPS4 much closer to the point now that we can tell each other anything and everything. I think everyone should laugh because you might not know that laughing over the stupidest thing could make any relationship better and make the two people closer. @CAPS4 live life to the fullest and laugh as much as you can because you never know when a good laugh could help you become friends with someone or bring you and someone closer than ever."	17	17		34				4	4	4	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	3						
21093	8	" Many people think that @ORGANIZATION1 is just like any other. These people are very wrong. @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 is very different than most. For you see, it is filled with humorous people. These people make up a lot of the bright side of @ORGANIZATION1. Where these people are you might ask? Why, they are every where. The best place to look is in the hallways, especially @DATE1 @ORGANIZATION1, during lunch, @CAPS2 after @ORGANIZATION1. Most of the people I will tell you about are friends of mine. There are also a lot of people I don't even know the names of. There is even a teacher I'll mention something about. Well enough chit chat, lets get to it shall we? I will first start with the teacher. I forget her name but she likes to talk with a @CAPS1 accent. She is also very enthusiastic, @CAPS2 I do mean enthusiastic. She often says, ""@CAPS3 we go!"". It's very funny. I have never seen her without enthusiasm. Many of the students are really disturbed by it. It can be annoying at times but at least she's not all gloomy or other. In fact we might even need more like her at this @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 many others. There is also a student who is also very enthusiastic, not all the time but quite often is he. His name is @CAPS4. @CAPS4 is quite a jolly kid. He loves to sing. I do mean he loves to sing. Even if he doesn't know the words to the song he is singing, he will sing. People always joke about him around him. The jokes are usually mean jokes, but he puts up with them @CAPS2 laughs along. I really do have to give him that much credit. It would be hard for just about anyone to put up with such rude words, let alone laugh with them. But enough of that. He is very jolly @CAPS2 really makes you laugh, which is really great. Don't stop being funny @CAPS4. There is a funny pair of boys who can knock your shoes @CAPS3, perhaps even literally with what they do. These two boys, named @PERSON3 @CAPS2 @PERSON1, are very humorous, as well as dangerously humorous. Ever heard of a @CAPS6? It is a brand of a toy that is very fun for little kids, as well as big kids. This toy is shaped like a bowl. You turn it inside out, aim the rim at the ground, @CAPS2 drop it. When it hits the ground, it pops up into the air. Well, @PERSON3 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 love playing with the @CAPS6, so much to the point that they found a new way to play with it. Instead of hitting the ground with it, they hit each other with it! They love to hurt each other. Eventually, though, the @CAPS6 got very worn out @CAPS2 tore. It needed to retire from its rough job, but @PERSON3 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 wouldn't let it. They just couldn't stop playing with it. @PERSON2, @CAPS9, @CAPS2 I haven't seen them playing with it lately. We think it might have broke. Ha ha! Never go wondering throught the hallways with @PERSON2, even if you have a destination. Trust me on this, you don't want to! @PERSON2 gets destracted very easily in the hallways. If she sees someone that she's wants to talk to, she doesn't tell you. She just twirls around @CAPS2 rushes over to them. For this, always have her take the lead if you do go with her; at least you'd know when she wonders @CAPS3 the trail. Never the less, @PERSON2 is still very humorous. She makes lots of random sounds. You get completely @CAPS3 guard @CAPS2 just can't help to laugh at how weird sounding those sounds are. @CAPS9 on the other hand, not only does sounds but also does hilarious facial expressions. She always tries to mimic the funny things her goats @CAPS2 pets do when she tells us about them. Together, @CAPS9 @CAPS2 I are very funny. In the @DATE1 finals started, we were drawing such goofy pictures of each other @CAPS2 random things. I drew her as a stick figure going to the moon, but the moon was very far away. We cracked up! She once redrew a little comic her brother thought of more than a year or two again. In the comic, it was a very ugly man who was telling his friends that they were going to a night club, but the ugly man turned out to be a woman. During finals, there was also a guy pulling is friend through the hallways by the arm. The friend said that it was very comfy. Then, they told a teacher about it! Ha ha ha! So you see, @LOCATION1 is much more than an ordinary @ORGANIZATION1. You could probably call it a clown @ORGANIZATION1 if you wanted to. Ha ha ha ha! You would never truly know just how many ha ha's I say a day until you visit, so come on over. We will let you join the fun!"	20	20	42	42				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	6	5	4	3	5	4	5	4	4	4
21106	8	"Water @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 we think that laughter is just an emotion, but in all actuality it's practically a way of life. We use laughter to cheer people up, or get out of trouble. People do stupid things just to make others laugh. I personally think laughter is a reason to live, and that every one needs more of it in their daily lives. I have always been the type to make every one laugh and feel better, and I would always put myself in pain just to cheer someone else up. When I was a child my friend would always be picked on at school, for no reason really. And I wasn't the type to take action, or try and get back at someone. But that all changed when my friend came home covered with food crying before school was even let out. She told me that these girls threw their lunches at her and were calling her names. So the next day I went to school with her in the morning and I took @CAPS1 filled with chocolate milk, smoothie, egg yolks and soured milk. When she pointed the girls out to me I grabbed the balloon with chocolate milk and threw it right at one of them and it hit her in the chest. She started screaming that her clothes were designer, like someone would actually care. I looked at my friends face, she was awe shock, but I could tell she was trying to hold back her joy because she knew I was not yet finished. I then threw one with egg yolks in it and got in a girls hair, her scream was earsplitting. The smoothie filled one got two of the girls who were hugging to try and keep each other safe (or trying to use each other as a shield) but it wouldn't work with my throws. They started to freak out and run to the others, which was a bad idea because they were all hudled together trying to figure out who it was. By the time they figured it out it was too late, I was already throwing the biggest balloon filled with soured milk at them and they couldn't get out of there fast enough. It landed in between all of them and exploded when they had turned to see what it was that was thrown. It covered all of them and they started screaming so loud that the school officials started coming out of the building to see what all the screaming was about.  I could see everyone of the kids who saw the whole show coming over to me, they started to tell me how amazing it was and how funny the girl's reactions were. Some kids were still on the ground laughing so hard they couldn't breathe. Some thanked me and told me that these girls had been picking on them for a while. I looked at my friend who was on the verge of tears. She ran over and hugged me so tightly I thought the air was going to be squeezed out of me. It's been ten years since then and I still talk to my friend, she even occasionally calls me if she's having trouble with someone at school. As for the girls? I haven't heard anything about them since they all got transferred to different schools. I guess laughter is the source of all joy in our lives, and helps people become closer then ever before. My friend still says that it was the best day of her life. Some of the other kids who witnessed the event go to high school with her now, and all ask how I am and want to see me do something like it again. Unfortunately I had to turn them down and tell them they have to learn how to deal with their own bullies themselves. I imagine that some of them have come up with very creative ways to get back at people by going off of what I did."	22	18		40				5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	4	3						
21110	8	" Laughter is a part of life that doesn't need to be taught. We're all born with the ability to laugh. Laughter and being able to laugh has been with us since the beginning so we don't really think about how important laughing can be. It gives us a sense of relief, a feeling of joy, and it also brings people together despite barriers like background or language. I think one of the most important things laughter does for people is bring them together. When you meet with someone you haven't seen in a long time or you have to be in a group of people you don't know, a little laughter can break the ice and bring you closer. I want to tell of a time when I visited my family in @LOCATION2 who I hadn't seen since I was two years old.   My brother and I were the only ones visiting from our family. So we didn't get to have our mom there to make us feel comfortable, or introduce people. I was quite worried about being able to communicate with my family in @LOCATION2 because although I can understand and speak in @CAPS1, I'm not fluent. Being able to bond with the part of my family I never knew was very important to me and I was afraid that language would prevent that. I was also concerned for my brother because he can't speak @CAPS1 very well at all. While on the plane I contemplated how I should introduce myself, topics to talk about, and prepare answers for certain questions. I didn't want the language barrier to cause an awkward atmosphere.   Finally it was time to arrive in @LOCATION2. We landed in @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2 where a lot of my relatives live. My brother and I collected our baggage and went to go look for our uncles and aunts. We saw them waiting for us and @CAPS3 waved enthusiastically. Then naturally we responded with the same enthusiastic feeling. As we met them for the first time we exchanged hugs and phrases like ""I'm happy to meet you."" @CAPS3 were very kind to us and welcoming, but it still didn't feel like I was meeting my family. Things were very different and new for us. It was a lot to take in for two people experiencing jet lag.   The first night, we stayed at our oldest uncle and aunt's house. We had dinner together and talked about how our family is doing back in @LOCATION1. It was pretty awkward. Communicating with elder relatives who can't speak @CAPS4 was a lot harder then I had thought. The first night passed as I slept in the uncomfortable humidity. The next morning our uncle and aunt had planned for us to have dinner with our cousins and other uncle and aunt. I was excited to meet more of my family so soon, but until then we had to pass the time exploring our new surroundings. My brother and I checked out the house and walked up and down the streets. Immediately we could see the differences from what we were used to. We had a lot of fun embracing the fact that we were in a different country we have been familiar with, but never really known.   At last it was time to meet up for dinner with our other relatives. We drove into the downtown area of @ORGANIZATION1 and met up in a restaurant that overlooked the ocean, as @ORGANIZATION1 is right on the coast. I related to my cousins more because @CAPS3 were younger, in @CAPS3're mid twenty, and generally I can get along easier with young people. We gathered in the noisy restaurant and were seated in an area sectioned off for more privacy. As we were ordering our food and admiring the scenery from the window, I felt more at ease. Our food came and we started to eat. While we were eating, my cousin started cracking jokes which made everyone laugh. My brother and I were laughing so hard we teared up. During the whole dinner there was laughter and smiles. At that time I really began to feel like @CAPS3 were my family. I was really thankful for my cousin who started the laughter, because with out all the laughing I don't think we would have bonded so quickly.That was the time I felt that laughter is very important and brought me closer with the people I love."	23	22		45				4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	4	4	4						
21111	8	" Everyone knows that when it comes to coach @PERSON2 sr. theres always going to be a bunch of laughs, giggles, jokes, and pranks. If you dont experience any of the above, then you are absolutely lame. It all started when my lovely sister @PERSON3 decided to make it to @CAPS1 in @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, of course she wasn't going to want to go alone. That is why she brought @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and me. We promised to eachother that we were going to make the best of memories. Nothing in the world is better than sharing emotions with those who care for eachother. We had arrived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 on a lovely morning, we were all a little tired, but for the most part we were all hungry for sure, that is why coach took us to @ORGANIZATION1 so that we could buy some snacks. He, of course, ran straight to the @CAPS2.Pepper That old man always had to have one of those with him no matter what. Being a cross country coach and all, he wasn't a very good influence over his athletes. Anyway, if you are a @LOCATION3 fan you either know, or should know that he never liked when people touched his stuff, especially his @CAPS2.Pepper! oh man, god forbid you touch his pop. So seeing @PERSON2 all jittery and bouncy walking down the aisle gave us girls a wonderful idea, we were going to take his @CAPS2. Pepper, and drink it! ok maybe not drink it, but we were for sure going to take the pop from the old man. It's like stealing candy from a baby. We arrived at the hotel and coach told us to upack our stuffso that we could tour the place a bit. So while coach was getting our room keys, we decided that we were going to do a little unpacking for him as well. @PERSON1 and I took all of his @CAPS2.Peppers and stuffed them in our bag and acted like nothing ever happened. We got our keys and he told us that he would stay down and unpack the rest of the things, we didnt want him to do that because he would then realize that we had took his pop, so we immedietly ran to the rooms and threw everything on the floor so that we could come back and make him forget about unpacking and we would go straight to exoeriencing another one of those @LOCATION3 tours. It wasn't 'till the night time that we arrived back to the hotel and @PERSON2 hadn't said a single word about his @CAPS2.Peppers. We thought we were the coolest people ever! it was already late so we had no other choice but to head up to our rooms and stay there. We all thought that was kind of lame because none of us girls we tired, not even @PERSON3, and she raced in the morning. She was the rebel one out of all of us by the way. Tme passed and we were all still awake, we were absolutely bored and had nothing to do, so we decided that we would unpack @PERSON2's pop. We starred them down as if they were some prized possesion or something. We thought about drinking them, but that would have been bad. We couldn't leave our room or start a rave, therefore, we just decided to hit the sheets and get some shut eye because the morning was going to be big for us girls and coach. It was the morning that the second biggest race of @PERSON3's life was going to take place, and ... we were still in bed! of course @PERSON2 got up before everyone. We were awakened by a loud knock, we figured it would be @PERSON2 because who else would it be. We opened the door and big old bald man was standing there and said "" i'm only going to say this once"". I need my @CAPS2.Pepper. It was so funny we acted like we didn't know what he was talking about. We found it hilarious because old bald man was turning beet red, apparently he didn't find it funny. We kind of sorta in a way found that out when he pulled the @PERSON3 not racing card, we were terrified for our lives!, especially @PERSON3, since she was the one that was going to be racing. We played the dumb people for about five minutes until he actually was being serious, then we decided to play the nice guys. Yes, we gave him back his @CAPS2.Pepper. We learned a very valuable lesson that day, ""messing with @PERSON2 is like messing with a pig, you're both going to get messy, but the pig likes it"""	18	18		36				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3

I yelled to my @CAPS1 as i walked out of my room."I think it is on @CAPS8 book shelve but why do @CAPS2 need it?" my father replied.It's for @PERSON1's birthday present, I don't @CAPS4 any money for him and i promised him something amazing this year so i am going to take him to @PERSON2 @PERSON2 and we are going to ride are canoe down the giant sand dune.why cant @CAPS2 just get money from us or something and then buy him a card at the dollar tree? my @CAPS1 responded to me with a look on his face as if he were saying @CAPS8 the stupidest kid i know.@CAPS2 know i don't take handouts @CAPS1 i would @CAPS4 to work for that money and i don't @CAPS4 enough time to work for it and hangout with @PERSON1 all day, I mean it is his birthday after all and besides this is more fun I said with a mischievous grin on my face.Well alright the canoe is already hooked up to the truck, my @CAPS1 replied.That's fine with me pops, but can @CAPS2 give us a ride out there and back? I asked him trying that puppy dog face my sister always makes to get what she wants.Only if @CAPS2 stop making that weird face at me, do @CAPS2 want to drive? He asked me as we walked out the door to go pick up @PERSON1.Yes please, I said as he flipped me the keys.Pulling into @PERSON1's drive way i shut off the truck and stuffing the keys into my left front pocket i walked into @PERSON1's house. Walking into it i knocked on the wall and two heads turned to look up at me. One my best friend @PERSON3 a sandy short hair boy with a white face and the other was the birthday boy @PERSON1 who much like @PERSON3 had the same hair color but had pink rose cheeks. I thought i would fine @CAPS2 here i said . What's this adventure @CAPS8 taking me on today he asked? @CAPS2 will see soon enough i replied now throw on some shorts and get a crappy pair of shows I will be out in @CAPS8 living room watching the @ORGANIZATION1 win there game when @CAPS8 done. So leaving @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 to change I waited outside @PERSON1's room. Alright, said @PERSON3 we're ready now tell us. Not yet I replied with a mischievous grin on my face. @PERSON1 yelled goodbye to his mom as he closed the door behind us and we headed for the truck were my @CAPS1 was still waiting. So @PERSON1 said to my @CAPS1 as he got into the back seat do @CAPS2 know what @CAPS8 son is going to make us do today? Yes but @CAPS2 will probably want this one to be a surprise. Well why is there a canoe on top of the truck, are @CAPS2 going fishing @PERSON1? @PERSON3 asked as he climbed in next to @PERSON1. HA I wished laughed my pa as I started up his truck. Pulling out of @PERSON1's driveway I headed off towards the bridge and out of town, going straight towards @PERSON2. Turning into @PERSON2 I found a parking spot on the other side of an old car and shut off the truck, I tossed the keys to my @CAPS1 saying I don't think @CAPS2 will want me to @CAPS4 these in my pockets I said to my pa. There was only one other person there a drunk man waving a beer bottle around and sitting on a log. Putting the canoe into the water i tossed each person a paddle and said row to the other bank. As we reached the other bank we all jumped out and i pulled the canoe up onto the sand at the bottom of a massive sand duneWe are going to push this up the dune then wax the bottom and ride down the hill in it i said smiling madly at them bothYour stupid the commented together but were down they sad starting to push the canoe up the hill. As we reached the top we flipped the canoe over and started hurriedly waxed the bottom, then pushed it to a likely spot to slide down and all jumped in we slide forward a little but stoped. Without another word me and @PERSON3 jumped out and pushed with while running then jumping in we flew on down the sand dune and hit the water with a thud snapping the canoe in two as it flipped me out to a log ten yards away as i saw @PERSON3 fly out and hit the water with a cannon ball as @PERSON1 just fell out the side into the shallows. When i emerged i heard the drunk man yell from the other side of the bank."@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 THE @CAPS5 @CAPS6 IN THE @CAPS7 OF @CAPS8 @CAPS9' "	20	16	36	36				5	5	5	5	4	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3
21115	8	" There are many reasons why laughter is an important part of any relationship. In my opinion you can no be serious about everything. Laughing is a way of lettting yourself go and relieve stress. Laughter also helps lighten the mood and make people more comfortable around each other. Laughter can help in many more ways then that.  Being serious about everything is not always a good thing. You need to have fun in your life to keep you happy. Being around people that make you laugh is always a good way to put yourself into a good mood. Laughing is a good way to take the pressure off and not be ebarressed. Being able to have a realtionship with people where you can laugh at things when they are funny is always needed. For me i know that being around people who cant laugh things off i always feel like i need to watch what i say. Laughing is one of the best way to just relax. Laughter also helps lighten the mood and make people more comfortable around each other. If i do not feel like i can joke around and laugh with the people that i am with i usually do not feel like i can be myself. Altough if you are not comfortable with the people that you are with to start with then it might be harder for you to joke around with them. Eventually if you let yourself go and laugh you will feel closer to them. Being happy and laughing with people makes a really strong connection between people. Making things into a joke is a way alot of people keep their selfs from getting embarssed. Usually if you do something that other people think is funny and you dont, then if people laugh you might feel uncomfotable. But if you start to laugh with them it takes the pressure off you and they are not longer laughing at you but now with you.  In conclusion there are many things that laughing can do for you. It makes it so you dont have to be serious about everything, it takes the pressure off and relieves stress. Laughing is one of the best things that people can do together to make a connection. No matter what laughing can always put someone in a better mood."	17	15		32				4	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21123	8	" When we were little it was watching @CAPS1. In junior high, it was seeing a kid squirt milk out through his nose. But now as we approach our high school years, we stifle giggles, suppress outbursts, and laugh until we cry, for our own reasons; and we can't hold back the inevitable urge to laugh. Some say laughing is the best medicine, unfortunately for my sister an I, this was not the case; laughing just got us in more trouble. No matter how many times we were lectured, someone always found their way back into the other one's room purely because we were nosy. I remember back a few summers ago, I'd seen @PERSON1, my sister, putting a bag of chocolate under her mattress. There was a possibility it was gone, but I had no doubt in my mind that it was still there. But as the mattress was lifted up and as I was beginning to reach for it, the bed was shoved back down, very nearly smashing my fingers. there stood @PERSON1 with a vindictive look in her eyes and two hands placed on her hips. What could I say? What could I do? A shill scream escaped my lips and I bolted for door before she could unleash her wrath upon me. Up the stairs, around the couch, through the kitchen I ran; but not fast enough. Before I could lock myself in the bathroom, she caught my ponytail and yanked, hard. I was in for a nine year old, hair pulling, all-@CAPS2 beating. But lucky me, no more harm could be done because my @CAPS4 had heard my scream and had come to investigate. Fighting was taboo in our house, but that never stopped us. @CAPS4's punishments were minuscule, we could hug and make up, or stand in the corner. The anger in @LOCATION1's eyes was already gone, and a certain, significant smile played across her lips. @CAPS4 was still trying to play the strict parent, but to us, the passed four minutes were just a joke now.  ""@CAPS3,""she had said, one word, one meaning, that's all it took. We exploded in a roar of giggles and laughter. Although there was no way @CAPS4 could have known this, we meant no disrespect, but be couldn't keep silent. Boisterous laughs rang through the hallway, so loud, @CAPS4's words were inaudible. Grabbing our hands and pulling us towards the living room we were half dragged because we were shaking to hard. Ten feet apart we stood, eyes focused on the ninety degree angle in front of our noses. But one look at each other and sent another tremor of giggles through our little bodies. We could have been inebriated if you didn't now any better, but really we were just two rambunctious kids playing around. We all have our reasons to laugh. Maybe your reason is as simple as reading an e-mail that made laugh so hard you cried. Maybe it is because my amateur writing style is a joke to you, or maybe you too have just witnessed a child's nose spew chocolate milk. We all have things in our life that make us want to roll on the floor, or slap our knees; but from my experience it's excruciatingly hard to hold back, so let it out."	20	23		43				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	4						
21131	8	" Laughter is huge part of life. Or so that is what I believe and grew up with. ""A day without laughing is a waste of a day."" @CAPS1 quote has greatly influenced my life. As well as the people in my life.  My mother is quite the entertainer. People have told her that she should become a comedian. Apparently our family stories are very amusing. Mostly because they involve my brother in some way or another. He's adventurous, spontaneous, and is not afraid of anything. Sometimes his decisions are not the smartest. A majority of the stories my mom talks about are from when my brother was little. She loves to talk about one in particular.   When my brother was younger he liked to take part in adrenaline based activities. Like extreme rollerblading, biking, and skateboarding. He would try to do every trick in the book and then some. @CAPS1 story, however, does not include him getting hurt or someone else getting hurt. Which is surprising because it seemed like every day he would injure himself or his best friend @CAPS2.  When I was about eight or nine, putting my brother at age eleven or twelve, we were at one of my soccer games. My brother had to use the bathroom and when he came back, my mom was not pleased. He went to use the port-o-potty and he had just gotten two new shirts; a white t-shirt to go under a new button-up. It was a hot afternoon, so he took off his new white t-shirt but kept on the button-up. Unfortunately, he dropped the white shirt. He dropped it into the rancid, disgusting excrement. If @CAPS4 ask him, it was all an accident and my mom was not happy about it.  My mom is the person in the family who thoroughly enjoys laughter. I think about her words of wisdom all the time, ""@CAPS3 when it seems like nothing can get better, think of the positives in your life and laugh. Because really, that's all @CAPS4 can do. If @CAPS4 embarrass yourself in front of a lot of people @CAPS4 need to laugh it off. If @CAPS4 can laugh about it, it won't matter if anyone else does."" @CAPS4 need to get through life somehow. Might as well make it the best, and laughter is truly the best. It makes my mood better, and makes me feel welcome and at home.    There are many stories about what my brother did, or how blond I am. But ultimately, all that matters is that we can laugh about something every day. It brings us closer. ""A day without laughing is a waste of a day.""  "	20	15		35				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21135	8	" I have always tried to be a happy person, and over time I have learned that laughter is a key component to my happiness. I have succeeded in being a happy girl most of my life. Even as a baby, I hardly ever cried; I was always laughing and giggling. As I have grown up, I have tried to keep up my happy-go-lucky spirits. Sometimes this was not the case, but that is simply reality. There have been many times in my life where laughter was all that surrounded me. I rely on laughter to keep me close with my friends, and so far, this trust has always came through, and it has worked for me. I often find myself remembering that laughter and happiness is really what life is all about. When I was first born, I didn't cry. I never cried very much as a baby. My mom reminds me of this whenever I ask her about my baby years. As a young kid, I wanted to be a part of everything that surrounded me! I was always looking for laughter and exciting events; I didn't want to miss a beat! My mom would have to take drives just so I could take a nap, and even then, I would hardly ever fell asleep. For if I did, @CAPS1 forbid, I might miss a moment of laughter! If someone else was laughing, I was laughing with them. Sometimes, I had no idea what was going on, or I wondered why what they had said was so funny, but I loved the feeling laughing with other people. I am always reminded of my happy toddler years whenever I look at my baby pictures. I don't have one of those pictures where I am bawling my eyes out, like you might find in most kid's baby pictures. In every baby picture of me, I'm laughing. If I'm not laughing, then there is a wide smile spread from ear to ear! Laughter is what kept me a happy baby! As a preteen, I was still the girl who you would always see laughing and smiling. I sometimes wondered what it felt like to cry because I had never felt that type of feeling before. I was always so caught up in laughter that I never had time to think about the negative. Now, I unfortunately know the feeling of sadness and being upset, and I try incredibly hard to go back to when I didn't know these feelings. Whenever I'm feeling down, I attempt to find laughter in each thing I do. When I attempt this, I can always find laughter, and my spirits are brought back up. My friends are always a place I can go to for a pick me up. Especially @PERSON1, who is my best friend. Every time I am with her, I find myself laughing for one reason or another. @PERSON1 and I have not had the steadiest friendship, but what always brings us close again is laughter. Our fights always end when we find common ground in something funny. Usually, she is the one who finds this, and she makes me laugh. Laughter is what has kept @LOCATION1 and I so close for the past few years. If laughter didn't exist, I can assure you that we would be anything but friends right now! Not long ago, I was in the car with three of my closest friends: @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, and @PERSON2. We were all laughing and singing as loud as we could to one of our favorite songs. I looked over to my friends and saw all of their smiling faces, and I found myself smiling too. I realized then, that laughter is truly what life is all about. Laughter is what has kept me close to all of my peers throughout my life. When I was little, I was gravitated towards those who I had the most fun with, and who I laughed with the most. As I've grown older, that same thinking is still there; I want to be with the people that make me laugh. The older I have gotten, the more I've learned about what I need in a friend. My main criteria is someone who can make me laugh. If I'm with someone with a dry sense of humor, and who doesn't talk at all, then I am going to go find someone who is laughable and hilarious!  Laughter is something that I am extremely thankful for. It has been the key to making me happy for all fifteen years of my life! From when I was a baby, up until now, laughter is what always has been, and what always will be, what my life is all about!"	17	23	40	40				3	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4
21137	8	" My best friend @PERSON2 turned thirteen on a beautiful @DATE1 day. Her family had a boat and, since it the weather was not quite uncomfortably hot but not so cold that it was chilly outside, @PERSON2 decided to have a sleepover birthday party on the deck with some of her closest freinds. I was nervous about meeting her school-going friends since I'd always been a homeschooler and wasn't going to know any of the other people there. When I arrived at the boat, @PERSON2 introduced me to her friends @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. I greeted them all and @PERSON2 suggested we go @CAPS2. I was ready to walk down to the beach but @PERSON4 said she wanted to go @CAPS2 right on the docks. @CAPS2 by the boats wasn't allowed and I was certain @PERSON2 would say @CAPS1 immidiately but instead she walked over to the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sign, tore it down, and tossed it in the harbor. Her friends laughed and I laughed too. I'd never seen people act this way. But their disregard for rules and customs was contagious. As the day went by I watched the was they talked and behaved. The girls used bad language and spoke harshly. Everything they said was loud and shocking and everything they did was to be wild and challange authority. They acted so free but there was something about their interactions with each other that seemed forced. I wondered if they were truly this way or if they were just pretending. But I understood that to be part of them I had to act like them. It was my first expirience with peer pressure and I didn't know quite what to do. But the girls' attutudes were simple, so I adapted and started to behave like them. But it became clear to me that in order for there to be a group there has to be someone who wasn't in the group. That was @PERSON3. @PERSON2' parents had made her invite @PERSON3 and @PERSON4 and @PERSON1 knew it. They would sit close together so she didn't quite have room, they would look with disintrest at her without laughing when she tried to make a joke. I became aware that if I hadn't adapeted so quickly to the attitude of the girls, I might have been the one they left out. I also knew that they could still turn on me if I did something wrong. We were sitting on the deck of the boat talking about movies and @PERSON3 was trying to tell the group about one that she'd just seen and was now her favorite. @PERSON1 stared blankly at her, refusing to smile. @PERSON4 looked off into space. @PERSON2 rolled her eyes to me. Sudenly, @PERSON1 cut @PERSON3 off and started talking about a scary movie she'd just seen. @PERSON3's eyes widened, then she looked down at the ground. Without thinking, I laughed and reached out to her arm, telling her I wanted to hear more about the movie. I'll never forget the way she lit up at that simple kindness. She smiled and began to gush about how amazing it was with renewed enthusuasm. @PERSON1 condinuted her story while watching @PERSON3 and me. @TIME1, when we went to the movie theater and the girls chose to sit in a row that only had room for four, I moved to sit with @PERSON3 in the next row down. We talked about the absurdity of straws for drinks and how we would never, ever wear skinny jeans. It was easy to talk to her. I didn't have to run everything I said through my head to make sure it wouldn't make anyone dislike me. Even @TIME1 when we were back at the boat, I tried to behave in the same way. I'd never had to focus on being myself before but I knew if I could do it, @PERSON3 would have someone to talk to. To my surprise, everyone became more natural. Soon we were all joking about what ridiculous things @PERSON2 should wish for with her birthday wish. I suggested a lifetime supply of marshmellows. @PERSON4 suggested the original @CAPS3 of @CAPS4. @PERSON3 suggested to wish that everyone in america would speak with a @CAPS5 accent on @PERSON2' birthday from now on. Everyone laughed. I saw that day that kindness if more powerful than crulty. Making someone an enemy or an outsider doesn't make a friendship stronger. Neither does having to worry about saying or doing something that might make your friends reject you. But integrity and kindness can bring people closer."	19	20		39				5	4	5	4	4	3	4	4	5	4	4	4

They didnt think that they would still be together if they ddnt have any laughter in their relationship. Laughter is the shortest distance between each other because if you dont see this person, but you can sill laugh with this personand have a great relationship with that other person.  Laughter between these two people laughed all the time and they got closer then ever, even though they didnt see eachother all the time, everyday I knew that there relationship wouldnt be alive anymore if they didnt have there laughter, it means that you are happy with that person.  Laughing with somone that you care about also means that you can trust that person and you are being yourself around that person and you dont have to act how you would normally with someone else that you dont trust! I had a boyfriend that i could laugh with all day everyday and thats what kept our relationship together. We laughed instead of talking because that says how we feel towards each other, and we could just tell that we were happy with each other just by laughing. Sittin on the couch staring at each other in the eyes, then we just started to laugh because we thought of something that we had said that made us bust up and just to laugh like crazy even with out saying any words.  Even though we had our fights we would still laugh at eachother and things that made us laugh that one other said. I would be really upset and sad and he would would just know what to say to make me laugh, then i am happy because i know trhat he ares about me and cares if im happy or sad I am. A real relationship is very hard to find with a guy that can make you laugh when your really upset or mad by just smiling or saying somethings that is goofy. Even though he was mad at me he would still try to make me laugh or smile because thats what i relationship is about. If you cant smile or be happy with that person that you ""love"" then you shouldnt be with that person because you know that you wont be happy and you will always be depressed or just plan old mad at that person. Laughter is a key thing and its something that can bring your relationship closer in many ways. If you laugh with that person and you can be yourself that means that if you break up after if it didnt work then that is probably a good sign that you guys will be great friends after. I believe that laughter is something that makes two people closer and then it also is the shortest distance between two people, if you dont wanna talk like me and my boyfriend do we just sit or stand there and laugh because we knew that we could just laugh at eachother and im sure people that we were weird or something, but we didnt even care so we would just laugh and laugh all day everyday all night long. I think that if you arent even in a relationship and you guys or gals are just great friends like me and my friend @CAPS1 are then you can just laugh at everything that you think is funny and just have a great time, you dont have to be in a relationship with someone to laugh with someone. Laughing is great fort the soal."	16	19		35				4	3	4	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4						
21157	8	"                               Sound @CAPS1  @CAPS2 someone hears something funny, said person begins to laugh. @CAPS2 the funny thing being heard was someone else laughing, the whole room begins to engage in laughter. This has happened to myself many times, but the one time I remember most, was @CAPS2 I began making strange noises. I normally make sound @CAPS1 and such @CAPS2 I'm bored and want to start a conversation, but I had never laughed and made sounds like that before. That moment changed the way I laugh today. The date was @DATE1, it was my birthday, so I decided to have my party at @ORGANIZATION1. I invited my two best friends, @PERSON4 and @PERSON3, to tag along. We love to laugh and just have fun. So, inviting them was a no-brainer.  Immediately, we decided that our favorite water slide in the park was the grand and slightly over sized @ORGANIZATION2' @CAPS3. It was a large funnel with flashing red and @CAPS15 lights inside. We went on it over, and over, and over again. The adrenaline was pumping through our veins as the ride would end and we'd leaped from the inter tube and rush to the stairs where the waiting line was held. We talked, chatted, sang, yelled, and most likely annoyed every other person in line. Then, @CAPS2 we finally got to the top of the stairs, we became in awe of the lifeguard. But, not because he was gorgeous. He looked as if he was a wee little leprechaun! We stifled a small laugh and got on the ride. @PERSON4 asked him to turn the inter tube around so that she could go down the ride backwards. He then began to talk, and we couldn't help but smirk. He began flirting with us by saying in his manly voice, ""@CAPS4 want me to ride down with @CAPS4 ladies?"" @CAPS2 he said that, @PERSON3 was the first to break. Then me. Then @PERSON4. We couldn't hold it in anymore. He then awkwardly cackled and pushed the inter tube down the slide. We were laughing so hard that we weren't even paying attention to the ride. Then it hit me.  ""That dude looks like @PERSON1 @PERSON1!!"" I screamed to @PERSON3. @CAPS2 the ride ended, we thought for a second. Then undoubtedly went again. Truth be told, he @CAPS8 look like @PERSON1. We began laughing again throughout the ride, up until I made a strangely abnormal sound. I made a noise that sounded as if a pig had just had it's tail yanked. It was almost a shriek, but more of a squeal. @CAPS6 just happened? @CAPS8 I seriously just...just...@CAPS9?! Note: A best friend will always be there for @CAPS4, especially @CAPS2 @CAPS4 @CAPS8 something embarrassing. It's their job to poke fun at one's strangeness.   So of course, @PERSON4 was the first to say, ""@CAPS6 the heck was that?""  @CAPS7 followed by @PERSON3's expression of, ""@CAPS8 @CAPS4 just @CAPS9?"" That's @CAPS2 we began to laugh and then I started making even more unusual noises. I started squealing, snorting, and hiccuping. We were still laughing at my crazy squel @CAPS2 we got off the inter tube.  Later after we had our fill of the @ORGANIZATION2' @CAPS3, @PERSON4 decided we should go in the wave pool. Of course, @PERSON3 and I agreed. The speaker system in the area started blaring the song ""@CAPS11"" by @PERSON2. @PERSON3 is my go-to-gal @CAPS2 it comes to breaking out in song. She began singing, then we all joined in. But @CAPS2 it got to the chorus, ""I throw my hands up in the air sometimes..."" we all said, ""I throw my banana in the air sometimes...""  ""@CAPS12 my @CAPS13, we should totally make a song of our own."" @PERSON4 said.  We began thinking of different lyrics we could say in our song. At first, we knew exactly @CAPS6 to say to fill in the chorus, then we decided that the song needed more lyrics. That was harder to think up. But, then we decided that we should make the song about food and the way we eat it. We had so much fun. Eventually, we came up with the entire song and people were staring at us as we screamed it to the world. Then, the terible noise arrived again. @PERSON4 began to laugh, then @PERSON3 and I joined in harmony, then a rude interruption by my @CAPS9. @PERSON4 and @PERSON3 continued to laugh at my sound @CAPS1. I joined in with them, laughing at myself.  That night we went to bed, humming the tune of our new song, ""@CAPS14 @CAPS15"" out loud. Now, whenever we hang out, we begin to sing our song, and sometimes, even dance! People still look at us strange, but then we just start laughing, and I start making sound @CAPS1."	20	20		40				4	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21158	8	"                                  How @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 only took one @DATE3 to change the whole purose of my @CAPS1. Two things that made my @CAPS1 more than I ever thought @CAPS3 could be; @CAPS4 and one girl. I realized over just one @DATE3 that there is more to @CAPS1 than what we see or hear. Emotions that you can't describe. Something that you have to live out for yourself. Looking back on three months of @CAPS1 changing events, I laugh at how fast my @CAPS1 turned and started heading the right way. Also how one girl can bring me to church and how @CAPS4 can keep a relationship moving strongly. We're part of a movement that will last forever. Her and I moving on the perfect path to eternity with eachother. Have you ever had a person in your @CAPS1 that made you so overwelmingly happy that @CAPS3 caused you to change your @CAPS1 plan forever? I have found some things on this earth that explain my whole purpose on earth. The first time I ever saw this girl. @CAPS3 was like a instant shock through my body. @CAPS3 felt like I needed her, like something was whispering in my ear,""go get her."" One day talking to my friend about this girl I couldn't get out of my head. I told him how I was going to talk to her @DATE4 and there was nothing that was going to stop me.  @CAPS6 said,""I have a class with her.""  @CAPS6 thought about her and I together; like in a relationship. In a intense thought @CAPS6 looked up at me and said,""actually I think you guys would be perfect together."" @CAPS7 that @CAPS6 said that I said, ""sweet."" I talked to her that day. She was better than I expected. I needed back up though. I had a different friend come with me to talk to her and her friends. I saw her in the hall. So we started to walk over. We got to them and my friend just kept walking. Thinking in my head, ""what a great friend."" @CAPS3 was me alone with seven other girls. Trying to look the best I could look. What @CAPS7 me is I actually pulled @CAPS3 off. She actually thought i was attractive. Was @CAPS3 love at first sight? I don't know you tell me. Getting close to @DATE3. I got my license. Looking forward to what my @DATE3 was going to look like. All was looking really good. Until i found a job at a ice cream factory. Waking up at four in the @TIME1 wasn't the best way to start out my @DATE3. I still wanted to impress her and be with her all @DATE3. I met a guy named @PERSON1. @CAPS6 asked if I wanted to study the bible with him. I knew that @PERSON2 went to the same church. So i wanted to do @CAPS3.  About two months @DATE2 they went to a church thing over in @LOCATION1. @PERSON2 was baptized there. Then @DATE2; after they got back. I was baptized. We both had @CAPS4 with us. Love was building up between us. What better to do than date? We started dating on @DATE1. Wonderful moments that I will never forget. That look she gave me like fire burning in her eye's with love. Going to the beach, driving around, fair rides, picking her up and never letting go.  Still with love burning inside of us. I went to her house. Lost track of time and noticed I was going to be late getting home. @CAPS3 was a rainy night. Saying good bye to her parents and giving her a big hug. I ran out the door, got in my truck, and took off. Couldn't see well. A corner popped out of no where. Started slidding across the road. A tree was moving toward me. I hit the tree. In mid flight. Time slowed way down. I thought is this @CAPS3. One picture popped into my head. @CAPS3 was her face. I landed with a big screaming sound. I got out as fast as possible. I came out with cuts and bruises but that was @CAPS3.  I thank @CAPS4 that I survied my crash. I am so lucky I didn't die. main oint is. I think I was put on this earth to be with her and thats what I'm sticking to. @CAPS3's times like these that make you realize how amazing @CAPS1 is. Laughing at @CAPS3 now. How laughter can change your @CAPS1 around. I finally said I love you girl. We are together to this day."	15	20		35				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21171	8	" In the @DATE1 on the month of @DATE2, I experienced laughter on a grand scale. If I recall the memories correctly, the event began on the day of @CAPS1, when my family gathered for a celebration. The day began normally as any @CAPS1, when all were busy attempting to prepare for a feast, and I lobbying around, careless and oblivious to the world around me. Even so, I am able to work with my parents and complete the preparations for that day. It was a sudden burst of joy that finally did me in. A burst of laughter and joy came to me without reason or sanity, I just enjoyed. People, my family, looked upon me with confused eyes, bewildered by my actions and expressions, kept distance from me. Though I continued I still felt a sense of worry, for if I had lost my mind they too would lose faith in my social prowess. For that very day, I noticed a different side to me, a side that I wish would vanish from my being. Never again will I look into a mirror and unto myself, see the sane person I use to acknowledge. The day after the bizarre and unkind gesture I had made among my peers, I attempted to apologize for my actions. Although the first attempt seemed to startle them, seemingly due to the nature of my conversations and excuses made during the short interviews. So onward I continued in my life, again oblivious to my surroundings, yet it differed in my earlier life. I felt a kind and gentle side of myself be released, a relentless stress was lifted from my shoulders and allowed me to continue in my daily life. This is when I noticed another person burrowed into my soul, my alter-ego coming to light and possessing my body. This other being, this alter-ego, I gave the name @PERSON1, and with these new emotions that came with I accomplished great feats. Even today he sometimes comes out in times when I have accomplished feats of knowledge or endurance. He gives strength to me, by providing a promise of laughter to me and all peers surrounding me. I view him, as not another person so to say, however as another part of my being. Never before that day did this other side of me come into light so clearly and with such promise. I do believe that we all have this person, this personality within us, empowering us to drive forth and never look back.End."	20	15		35				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21175	8	" Day after day, people laugh. For many different reasons, only those who are laughing @MONTH1 know.There have been times in everyone's lives, where they just need to laugh. Maybe because we are upset, or to make a situation more comfortable, to get to know someone better, even to just get a conversation started. I was @NUM1 years old, I was finally hired for a job. I am now an employee for @ORGANIZATION1. Being the youngest guy @CAPS1 the crew, I had to make an impression. I didn't know @CAPS11 to do. My first few days were awkward and silent.I was so nervous, i kept thinking to myself "" @CAPS11 am I doing, I don't belong here. I don't know anyone, don't knowwhat i am doing."" @CAPS1 one of the hottest days of the year, we had finished our work for the day and everyone @CAPS1 the crewwas going to the river. I wasn't planning @CAPS1 going, until @CAPS2, one of the guys that i will also be going to school with came up to me and said "" hey @CAPS3 @CAPS21 need a ride to the river?"" and @CAPS6 laughed. "" @CAPS4 could @CAPS21 give me a ride to my house to grab a pair of shorts?"" I replied.  "" @CAPS5 I'll lend @CAPS21 a pair."" @CAPS6 said. "" I don't think @CAPS21'll have a pair that will fit my fat ass."" I replied. "" @CAPS7 @CAPS7 @CAPS17 i do lets go."" @CAPS6 said @CAPS2, and I walked over to his truck and went to his house. I noticed something as soon as I got into his truck, a bottle with @CAPS11 I thought was coffee in it. I asked him. "" @CAPS10 do @CAPS21 need coffee in the morning?"" I said "" @CAPS11 are @CAPS21 talking about?"" @CAPS6 replied "" The bottle."" I said "" @CAPS7 @CAPS7 @CAPS21 dumb ass, that's not coffee that chew spit."" @CAPS6 repliedI just left it at that. We got to his house, walked in through the garage, and there was the cutest dog i had ever seen,her name was @ORGANIZATION3. She followed us though the house, and @CAPS6 gave me the tour. Then handed me a pair of shorts and we went @CAPS1 our way. We all met back up at work, and went from there. This being my first time going to the river with them, I saw so much of the property that i had never seen before. We went past our hay barn and down a gravel road. to this gate, which led to the river. I had never seen the gate, I'm riding in the bed of @CAPS2's truck, bouncing around. The road has so many ruts. Once we reach the river,everyone starts changing. My bosses daughter is there and our crew leader's girlfriend. And I glance over at them once there dressedand my crew leader, @PERSON1, looks at me and says ""@CAPS16"". and so I turn around and @CAPS6's tossing the cooler at me. I try and @CAPS16 the cooler but it throws me to my butt. Everyone starts laughing even I do, @CAPS6 comes over and helps me up and says, "" that's for looking at my cousin and girlfriend."""" @CAPS17 I looked, hell i aint got no chance of hooking up with them anyway"" I replied. Everyone laughed, and that's how we started out day at the river. In a great mood. We sit around and listen to music talking and having fun.Then @CAPS2 and @PERSON1, start floating down the river. So we all go, all of us trying to @CAPS16 up. We finally do all of us are sore from the rocks @CAPS1 our rears. There is this log I see, sitting in the river. I climb to the top, and try a back flip. Only to show off of course. some how @CAPS19 perfectly in the river. All of us start jumping off and having a good old time.   It starts to get dark, and we get to the bank, start walking back. everyone going a different way because we all know the best way back.we all finally make it back. And go up to @CAPS6 house, once we reach the house, they decide we're going out to eat. Once we get to @ORGANIZATION2 all order, @PERSON1 says to me "" @CAPS20 o, @CAPS21 know we were all kinda worried about @CAPS21, @CAPS21 never spoke."" "" I had nothing to say"" I replied."" @CAPS21 know, your gonna get yourself in trouble checking out a guys family and girl"". @CAPS6 said."" I know, but i cant help it"". I replied. I looked over at his cousin and winked."" @CAPS21 have some balls, but I'm glad @CAPS21 @CAPS1 the crew"". @CAPS6 said. That's when I knew, I was finally welcomed. That night I stayed at @CAPS2's, and we just sat up watching @CAPS24 and joking back and forth.Now after looking back, I see that a good sense of humor can go a long ways. creates a good relationship. Now to me @CAPS2 is an olderto me."	18	20		38				3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21189	8	" Building the @CAPS1 with Laughter @CAPS2 a very early age my uncle would bring the funniest cards to mine and my brothers birthdays, just to see our reaction. Then when my uncle moved to the west coast, near us, we would piss each other off just see each others reaction. We have always known when each other is having a bad day and when to lift them up when they are down.  When my family and I would go back to @CAPS3 at an early age, we would always celebrate each others birthdays with our uncle. He would bring the funniest cards to give us and we would sit there and laugh about them for hours. Then when he moved to @LOCATION1 my older brother, @PERSON1, and I started to get him funny cards to see who had the best one. We got each other cards that had sexual humor to gross humor. We would come to each others birthdays with a grin, @CAPS2 one ear to the other, waiting for the person to open up the card. One year, for his birthday, I got him a card that had some older ladies on it and had some sexual humor towards it. Lets just say nobody has beaten that card. My uncle and I work in the same building but doing way different jobs. He is the sales manager and I put the items together for him to sell. When I walk into work, I always pass by him to see how he is doing. For the most part, he is either laughing or pissed off about something in his day. On days that he is upset and walks outside to make a label for @ORGANIZATION1, I start to make fun of him right away. Sometimes he gets even more angry. But when he does, he always seems to laugh after the fact, or come back at me with a rude remark. Everyday this happens and it always seems to brighten up our days.  We bought two season passes to @CAPS4.Hood this year. At first I wasn't very good at skiing, and would always fall. When I would fall, he would board down to me while laughing and I would get very upset. We would laugh on the way home talking about how I would always fall. But as time went on, I slowly got better than him and would be waiting for him at the bottom of the run. One time, when we went up, he just couldn't seem to stay on his board and would fall non-stop. This was the time when I could finally get him back for all the times when he laughed at me for not being able to stay on my skis. I never laughed so hard in my life on that ride home. Coming down and making remarks at him about not being able to stay on his board was one of the most warming things I have ever felt. It wasn't warming for me to make rude remarks. It was warming to me, to see that he couldn't say anything back, because his time finally came to be made fun of.  My uncle and I have the relationship we do today, because of his impact on me at an early age. Him being able to make me laugh at his jokes and knowing when to brighten up my day has been one of the best things that has happened to me to date. Changing my life for the best and changing my personality for the best. These laughing experiences have turned our ""uncle-nephew"" relationship into a friend relationship. My life is full of laughter and will be full of laughter for my life because of one person."	19	18		37				3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3						
21195	8	" There will always be moments in your life when your emotions will take control and motivate you. whether your happy, sad, angry or frustrated. At times like this I use my gift, the gift of laughter. My best friend, @PERSON1 looked at me with her big blue eyes, they were swelled up with tears. We had just finished packing the rest of her clothes and we knew it was time to say goodbye. It hurt me deeply to see her go after five years of friendship but, we had postponed this moment long enough. There the boxes sat waiting, each with their own label, they had all of our memories inside. We were never very serious, we liked to joke a lot and she always knew how to make me smile, today that would be hard though. After we put @PERSON1's stuff in the moving van I noticed her dog, @PERSON2 wasn't outside like he normally is. When I went inside I found out he hadn't been hiding in there either. This was strange because @PERSON2 was the type of dog that liked to have a lot of attention so he was always near you. When I told @PERSON1 that @PERSON2 was missing, we went to look for him.    It was @DATE1 time, my favorite time of year and the sun felt warm against my skin. I remember this moment very clearly, it was a memory I was sure I would want to savor. As we walked along @PERSON1 and I talked about all sorts of things, this made me almost forget she was going to have to leave in a few hours. Just then I noticed a shinny silver object laying in the ground, from where I was standing I couldn't quite read what the engrave stated but I could see the one letter that said it all, the letter @CAPS1. It was @PERSON2's red and blue collar, I reached down and picked it up I figured he must be somewhere near. Fate must have been with us that day because as soon as we glanced up the road we saw @PERSON2 riding in the back of someones old @ORGANIZATION1 truck. We started running after that truck as fast as we could and we were screaming, ""@CAPS2! Finally the truck stopped in front of our local store, the guy stepped out and he seemed aggravated with us.""That's my dog."" @PERSON1 stated, and I just shook my head in agreement. The strange man looked at us in wonderment and then looked at @LOCATION1. His face turned red in embarrassment as he too realized the dog in the back did not belong to him. This whole situation was funny and all we could do was laugh. With @PERSON2 beside us we started walking home, taking our time, dreading what would take place when we arrived back at @LOCATION2's house. That night I stayed up thinking about @PERSON1 and @LOCATION1, I was great full to that dog for running off so we could spend more time together. Also I was thinking that maybe he had a reason for leaving, maybe he knew that we weren't ready to say goodbye and we had to have one last adventure, one last laugh. When we laughed together for the last time that day, I knew that we would truly be friends forever no matter if she lived near or far."	20	18	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3
21200	8	" @CAPS4 whole life, I've been a child of laughter, one who did all @CAPS5 could to find the joy in existence. As I've grown, @CAPS4 hunger for delight hasn't ceased, and when I fell through a metal roof a few years back, @CAPS4 joyous obsession remained. The woman who gave me life is an only child. @CAPS5 has a few step-siblings, but it's a crew we never see. When I think of @CAPS4 relatives, those people never cross @CAPS4 mind. I actually can't even remember them. That fact makes @CAPS4 childhood seem void or vacant (considering that @CAPS4 father died when I was a tiny toddler), but there's no need to feel sympathetic towards me. I mean, sure, growing up in a low-income household, with a single mother and two young children was a hard thing to handle, but I made it through.   Have you ever had a best friend that you considered to be family in some way? That's all that @CAPS4 mother had. Unlike myself, her only savior in life was her closest confidant, @PERSON1. @CAPS5 and @CAPS4 mother had been best friends since before high school - before I was even thought of. @PERSON1's always been there for us. @CAPS5 even stood by @CAPS4 mother's side when I was born. I'm sure as teenagers, having babies was something outlandish, but a mere two years after @CAPS4 arrival, @PERSON1 found herself giving birth to her own beautiful daughter, @PERSON2. They've been @CAPS4 family ever since; @CAPS4 aunt and cousin. For all of @CAPS4 childhood, I grew up in one house. Throughout the years that I resided there, @PERSON1 and her daughter had taken multiple occasions to go on and join us. I used to share a room with @PERSON2, and we fought like rivals, but loved like sisters. @CAPS4 brother was born five years after I and three years after @PERSON2. @CAPS6 was always too small for us to play with, so having other girls in the house was convenient. The both of them served as the family I never had... but it wasn't always such a dandy thing. @PERSON2 and I did a lot of cruel fighting in our time, but I never once thought that maybe our fights would cause them to leave us. One @DATE1 @TIME1, on a warm and bare day, I awoke to find those people of @CAPS4 life missing. They had left. A year or so passed by, and we didn't see them around. @PERSON1 didn't drop by. @CAPS5 didn't send a letter. It was as if they fell off the face of the @LOCATION1. @CAPS4 heart was hurt, but it soon became healed. Our land-line phone began buzzing off the hook one evening, and to our surprise, @PERSON1 was on the other line, ""We just moved in. You have to come see our new place."" @CAPS1, it was as if nothing between the two adults ever went wrong. When we arrived to visit them in their new adobe, @PERSON2 took me to one of her friend's houses to climb their shed. I didn't object, I wanted to be friends again... though if I had known what was in store for me, I wouldn't have gone. As we walked from the crime scene and along the mile road, the most you could hear from our direction was @CAPS4 sobbing. A young boy who didn't seem much older than I turned the corner facing us. When @CAPS6 saw what a mess I was, @CAPS6 laughed. ""@CAPS2 isn't funny!"" I cried. His expression became serious, ""@CAPS3, I... what happened?"" @CAPS4 face was too buried in @CAPS4 hands for me to speak, so @PERSON2 took over, ""@CAPS5 fell through a metal roof!"" The both of us were thinking it, but neither of us said a thing: ""jerk!"" @CAPS6 turned sympathetic and offered a helping hand, but I turned him away. The further @PERSON2 and I paced down the stretch of cement, the more tolerable the wounds on @CAPS4 body became. ""@CAPS7,"" glancing over at @PERSON2, I smiled, ""@CAPS6 was really cute,"" I cradled @CAPS4 face out of embarrassment. @PERSON2 blushed, agreeing with @CAPS4 opinion. ""and it sucks because I'm crying, and dirty, and limping, and a huge bloody mess... and the world just always works @CAPS2 way! Of course I'd run into a cute guy looking like @CAPS2!"" @CAPS4 cousin laughed; @CAPS5 full on cracked up, amused by me. I didn't quite understand it at the time, but something that stirred up in the situation tickled against @CAPS4 inner stomach, and I laughed as @CAPS3. The two of us spent the rest of the distance laughing about the incident and sharing stories similar to our problem. Looking back on all of @CAPS2, I'd like to think that being a young, unintelligent, and naive adolescent brought @CAPS4 cousin and I back to common grounds, but then I'd be lying. In all honesty, it was our laughter. Even in the most scary and tense situations of the world, laughing for any reason makes a person feel better. Laughing heals feelings, arises thoughts, and brings people together."	15	22	40	40				3	3	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	5	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4
21204	8	" It was the first day of sophomore year. I had just moved to @LOCATION1 during the @DATE1 so I was nervous about the new school just like any kid would be. I walked into the school and checked out @CAPS4 surroundings. Everything seemed normal enough until I saw it. Near the middle of the sea of tables in the cafeteria was about four tables with around @NUM1 people at each one, but it wasn'@CAPS5 the fact that they were there that caught @CAPS4 attention it was what they were doing. They were dueling with @CAPS1-@CAPS2-@CAPS3 cards right there in the middle of the cafeteria where all could see! I was baffled, I mean I used to duel when I was younger in elementary school when the game was newer, but I had to quit cause everyone in @CAPS4 school stopped dueling, and here I am looking at at least @NUM2 highschoolers just dueling away. What surprised me most of all was that they were right there in the open where everyone could see, and worst of all judge. I moved to a table nearby them and began to watch a kid named @PERSON1 (who later has become one of @CAPS4 best friends.) mop the floor with his opponent. I quickly caught back on to most of the rules, and went home that day thinking ""I'm gonna get back into that game!"". So I bought a deck, and continued @CAPS4 recon of the tables, @CAPS4 deck sitting in front of me waiting for someone to challenge it's master. A few days went by as I continued @CAPS4 silent observation of the duelists. Finally a duelist named @CAPS5.J (another one of @CAPS4 now good friends) challenged me. I accepted and began. He then proceeded to thoroughly kick @CAPS4 butt in the space of what seemed like five rounds into the game. @PERSON1 then taught me he how to play better and we became best friends. He is a really funny guy, and to this day I cant hang around him without laughing. Through him I have met tons of great friends. Even now I wonder what @CAPS4 high school life would be like if they didn'@CAPS5 attend @CAPS4 new school."	16	15		31				3	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	4	4	3	3						
21209	8	"Fishing trip gone wrong @CAPS1 me introduce you to what I will be talking about today, fishing. Fishing has been a big part of @CAPS7 life ever since I was born. When I was little I used to go out with @CAPS7 dad and brother to go fishing. @CAPS7 dad loved to take us to go lake fishing. Ive fished every lake around these parts. When I was five years old I got a brand new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole it was so shiny and had a great ball bearing spinning reel. It even had some chrome going up the handle so when the sun hit it just right it would shoot a beams of bright light @CAPS18 the ground. Well as I grew older so did @CAPS7 fishing pole. The reel didn't turn as well and the chrome didn't shine like it used to.  When I turned @MONEY1 @CAPS7 pole was a broken down and just wouldn't work for @CAPS7 fishing needs anymore. So @CAPS18 the day of @CAPS7 tenth birthday @CAPS7 family and friends gave me a some money. I told them that I wanted to buy a new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole. So after @CAPS7 birthday I had acquired one hundred and @MONEY1. I thought I was the richest man in the whole wide world. Latter that night @CAPS7 dad came up to me and told me that @CAPS7 cousins wedding was this @DATE1 and that we might have time after to @CAPS15 a little bit of fishing. I went into the garage and packed @CAPS7 tackle box with pliers, hooks, spinners and all the fishing gear I would need.  After the @CAPS7 cousins wedding @CAPS7 dad said ""@CAPS6 go fishing."" @CAPS7 dad and I changed into our fishing clothes and were off but I had remembered that I needed a fishing pole so I asked ""@CAPS8 dad we need to stop at @ORGANIZATION1 quickly"". It turned out that there was a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS18 the way. We pulled into the @ORGANIZATION1 parking lot and I went in. I ran over to there sporting goods and found the last @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole siting @CAPS18 the shelf so I got it down and looked it over. This was the pole for me, the only downside was the price that happened to be seventy @MONEY1. I bought it anyways. I walked out of the store with @CAPS7 new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole feeling like I was a million bucks.  As we arrived at our fishing spot I noticed that we were not at a lake but a large river. @CAPS7 dad explained that I needed to be safe around the river cause you can get swept away if you fall in. I got out of our car and the wind was harsh. It was chilling to the bone. I took out @CAPS7 new pole and tackle box and started to setup @CAPS7 pole for river fishing. I put @CAPS18 one large weight and big hook. I was ready for anything or at least I thought. I then reached down into @CAPS7 big red tackle box and pulled out a large worm. ""I think the fish will love this."" I say aloud to @CAPS7 dad. Staring out at the fast flowing water and toss @CAPS7 baited fishing line off shore. A big splash of water then ripples, @CAPS7 dad and I smile with satisfaction. Right next to me was a branch buried within the embankment. Setting @CAPS7 pole down rather softly I look upon @CAPS7 dad as he pulls in a fish.  Well @CAPS18 our walk down to river there was this @CAPS13 @CAPS14 outhouse. Me needing to use the restroom, I turned to @CAPS7 right and said to @CAPS7 dad ""@CAPS15 not lose @CAPS7 fishing pole, I don't want it to going flying into the river if I get a big fish @CAPS18."" @CAPS7 dad reply's ""@CAPS17, @CAPS17 just go to the bathroom already."" @CAPS18 @CAPS7 walk to the bathroom I didn't see the big @CAPS19 that had landed near @CAPS7 fishing line. @CAPS7 dad saw them getting closer and closer to @CAPS7 line so he thought it would be a good idea to scare them away. As soon as I walk out of the bathroom @CAPS7 dad goes running and waving his arms at the @CAPS19. They all take off into the air, but something was trailing behind one of them weighing it down. What was it you @MONTH1 ask? It was @CAPS7 brand new fishing pole! It was at least @NUM1 maybe @NUM2 feet in the air. As soon as @CAPS7 pole took off flying it started falling. It didn't land @CAPS18 shore but it landed in the middle of this big wide river. @CAPS7 dad looks at me and says with a smile ""That's the first fishing pole that I've ever seen fly."" I start laughing uncontrollably then @CAPS7 dad starts cracking up. After the laughter was done @CAPS7 dad looked @CAPS18 shore for something to pull @CAPS7 pole in with but to @CAPS7 surprise he found it @CAPS18 shore down river.Will @CAPS20"	20	22		42				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	4	4	4						
21213	8	" Its my sophomore year and some of my friends were going to try out softball. After thinking about it I joined and I fell in love with this sport. I am not that good but like they say practice makes perfect. We all laugh and have a good time and everyone likes everyone and its fun to be apart of a team that is always laughing and having a great time together. This is about a time when my friends and I started laughing so hard we almost started cried and now its one of our little joke between all of us girls. Once my friends and I were out catching pop fly's and it was my turn to go catch the ball. I went out there skipping and just being my normal weird self. They hit the ball and it started to come toward me and I went running for it and slipped and fell right on my butt. Everyone including me started laugh because I fell in the mud and got all dirty. About ten minutes later we all were standing there and talking about how funny it was when I fell and how it made everyone's day. Then I saw some mud on the ground and I wanted to roll in it but didn't want to just lay down and start rolling in mud. So I asked my friend @PERSON1 to push me into the mud so I could fall in and roll in it. After she pushed me into the mud I got up and started laughing my head off. My knees were covered in mud and so was my butt and legs. They all started to say who shied on you because we are not aloud to curse, so we made something else to replace it. Now when I walk in the hall ways and see someone from the softball team we both just start laughing and say who shied on you in the middle of what ever we are doing right then.  This is the first year I have ever played a sport in high school and I am glad I did it because I am having so much fun. When it ends in a few months I am going to be really upset. All these girls and I have became so close in the last @NUM1 weeks that they are like family to me now. Most of us use to just know each other and not really were friends and never talked at all but now we all do. We love to do silly things like sing in the locker room randomly or make the most dumbest jokes ever. But we all have fun and we don't care. We have had lots of laughs and many more to come this season. Like when we have games on the buses or just even at practice. We have an amazing couch that makes us laugh and makes jokes everyday. This season should be interesting with all of us because we all like to laugh and make joke and sing and just have a great time with each other and that's all that matters to make a good softball team and a great season."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21218	8	" Every fiber of my being was urging me to talk to her, but my gut churned with anxiety every time I gathered up the courage to do @CAPS6. Then she glanced at me. Just for a second, but enough to gather information about me. Enough to tell that I wasn't just looking around the room vacantly, but I was focusing on her dark brown eyes, and hers only. I sheepishly flickered my eyes away, quickly counseling myself, why did you keep looking at her? You knew that she was going to notice! But somehow I knew I wanted her to. I wanted her to look back at me. I didn't feeling her gaze upon me anymore, even though it was only a second before that we made eye contact. I darted my eyes in her direction again. This time she was looking at me first and I fell into her sight. I didn't know what to do about this, I haven't been in this situation before. @CAPS5 girl has ever beaten me to first glance. She smiled, a cute little smile, I've noticed you noticing me, I don't see why you need to hide it. I have my eye on you. All I could do was focus on not looking like a moron. I willed myself to smile, but only slightly, enough to let her know i saw her smile, and it was at me! There was @PERSON1, smiling at me, giving me a chance to show her what makes me a guy for her. Then @DATE1 came. The ice rink in @LOCATION1 was about @NUM1 minutes away, which seemed short because of the @NUM2 friends that were howling and talking crap about each other in the back. We drove up and parked next to the rink. As we stepped out of my mom's minivan we could all hear the hustle and bustle of kids strapping on their rental skates and awkwardly walking towards the thick glass doors that lead to the oval arena of dry frigid air accompanied by a thick bed of cut up ice.Our group of friends all traded in our money and received our own pair of worn, probably never cleaned, ice skates. Absently we slide on the uncomfortable bladed shoes and waddled for the glass doors. One-by-one each of us stepped cautiously on to the ice, making sure we didn't look silly by sliding forward and performing the splits in front of everyone around us. When we finally conquered that challenge we proceeded to slide our way along with the current of skaters flowing in the counterclockwise loop around the rink. Every once in a while we'd race each other for a lap around the rink, but besides that we just talked about @CAPS1 of @CAPS2: @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and the various other games that held our interest.  But as usual that conversation turned into a debate about ""over powered classes"". One side complaining that they can never win against that class, the other saying that it's very easy to ""destroy"" them with a simple trick. I proceeded to daze off out of the fight, looking around the rink, watching people stumble along their path or glide gracefully through the awkwardly skating participants. Then I saw her again. Her hair was the first thing that caught my eye, it acting as a blanket would being hung on a clothes line out in a @DATE2's breeze. Then as she looping around the end of the rink her face started to be revealed, just as beautiful as before.  She wasn't having the hardest time skating, but every once in a while she would slide a skate too far to one side, lose her balance, but was able to regain her composure within a second or two. I smiled as she looked around, checking if anyone had seen her little mishap. ""@CAPS5 the sniper is @CAPS6 @LOCATION2, you don't know what you're talking about!""my friends sneered at one another. I had @CAPS5 interest in being pulled into this argument. As I sped up away from my friends, and weaved my way through the crowd, I eased my way towards @PERSON2. As i approached her I was running one-liners through my head to use as an icebreaker with her.  I noticed her feet slide outwards on both sides of her, and I smiled at what I could do to be able to engage her. As she began to stumble, I had to time my entry perfectly as to seem like a random bystander just there to help her back up, rather than an anxious boy trying to find a way to talk to her. Right when she was about to fall over I sped up and placed my hand on her back and gave her a little push upwards. But she was too far gone. She tumbled on top of me as we fell to the hard ice. As the commotion seized, she quickly jumped off and apologized for her clumsiness. But all she noticed was my hysterical laughing. All she could do was laugh along."	22	20		42				5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21233	8	"                            Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4  @CAPS1 your little, your exactly that, little. You look up at everyone with not a faint clue of @CAPS6 to do anything. Now, this is usually @CAPS1 your parents step in. They feed, and love and take care of you, but @CAPS4 importantly, they teach you what you need to know. Growing up I've learned that you need to help others, not just yourself. One way I find easy for me to help others is with laughter. Laughter isn't something that just effects the people around you, @CAPS2 also effects you. You can ask anyone if once in they're life anyone has ever made a difference by making them laugh. Or could have made a difference my making them laugh. @CAPS4 will be able to think of a time this has happened, some @MONTH1 not. Though I know for a fact, someone has made a difference in my life just by making me giggle. For instance, I remember a day @CAPS1 I had felt so alone and forgotten. I felt used, betrayed even. Growing up I knew my friends as a second family. They were always there for me. Though like @CAPS4 kids we fought, but by the end of the day everything was backed to normal. People say, ""@CAPS6 come I never noticed @CAPS6 easy I had @CAPS2 @CAPS1 I was little? I thought I had @CAPS2 bad then?"" @CAPS7 @CAPS2 doesn't matter @CAPS6 the problems change its all the same. @CAPS2 still hurts to fight with friends. You still have days you feel horribly alone, but your not quite sure why. One of those days where the littlest thing seem to cut the deepest. This day was one of those kind of days. Now see, I was young then; I was only in the third grade, and my best friend had been a girl named @PERSON1. I don't remember exactly what we had fought over, but I do remember @CAPS6 if felt.   I remember walking in the classroom, near tears by then. I'd dealt with @PERSON1 being so cruel before, but whatever she had said that day had really hurt me. I was always the first in the classroom, I'm not sure exactly @CAPS6 I was, but I always was. In my seat I sat down and didn't move. My brain had taken me to my own little world of sorrow. That's @CAPS1 she asked me what was wrong. Even as a child I hated @CAPS2 @CAPS1 people I didn't really know asked me if I was okay. @CAPS2 embarrassed me, for @CAPS2 was just another reminder that I was showing weakness to people who probably didn't care. Though this time @CAPS2 was different, and in a weird way @CAPS2 helped. I explained to my teacher what had happened in a rush of tears and details. What really made a difference is that after everything, my teacher tried to comfort me and make me feel better, she made me laugh. Whatever exactly I had told her, her response didn't just make me feel better, but made me realize @CAPS2 wasn't that big of a deal. I giggled for a while to myself, and by the time everyone was in the class I was happy. At the end of the day me and @PERSON1 were back to being best friends. My teacher honestly did me a favor. As a kid your vulnerable. You don't look at the world as a harsh, unforgivable place. That's why people turn out like they do. Its all about the environment they grew up around. I believe I was changed by that small effort. That one little joke made me realize everything's going to get better in the long run. Laughter's been important to me ever since. I helped me realize the effect you have on people. Even at a small age you still can make a difference. Since then I've used what my teacher had taught me. I learned that sometimes, even if you couldn't make them laugh, smile or just be happy; the fact that you tried really made the difference. Laughing is important. @CAPS2 changes people, no matter what the age."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21236	8	"  Every @DATE1 my family, friends, and I pack up for an exciting trip to @ORGANIZATION1. we always take our @CAPS3 runner, and boat along with us. We rent a large cabin that is right on the water side. We stay for about one week and it is always around one hundred degree's, so we normally spend the majority of the day swimming in the water. It is located over the pass about an hour from @CAPS1. Their are many fun activities to do at @ORGANIZATION1 like @CAPS2, kayaking, aqua cycling, bike riding, boating, and lots more.   This was the first year that my brother had his boating permit and I was very excited because it is way more exciting to have him take us out tubing rather then my parents who go very slow, and they don't make it that much fun. He would always put one of us on the @CAPS3 runner to @CAPS3 the flag when one of us fell off, and one of us would be on the tube. One time he took me and my friend @PERSON1 out. It was in the latter afternoon, and that's when the water gets rough, and choppy. First @PERSON1 was on the tube and I was flagging on the back of the @CAPS3 runner with my brother. He would have us going around in circles at about @NUM1 mph. She ended up flying off right away.   Once @PERSON1 got up on the @CAPS3 runner I hopped on the the tube and i told my brother I was ready. We would do thumbs up to go faster, thumbs down to slow down, and @CAPS3 your arms around like your crazy to stop. He started going and I had my thumb up for a while waiting for him to get going. He started going really fast and I was flying every which way going in circles. Every time I would hit a @CAPS3 I would get whip flash. I put my thumb down to go slower and he didn't slow down he kept going faster, and faster. Then I waved my arms around to make him stop. @PERSON1 was the one watching me, and she thought it would be funny if she told my brother that I wanted to keep going faster. Finally I did about two back flips into the water. I hit the water so fast that it felt like my skin was going to fall off, it hurt so bad.  It took about a minute for me to finally get to the top of the water when I took a huge gasp of air. I was sitting in the water waiting for my brother to drive over and pick me up. Something didn't feel right, I didn't have my bikini bottoms on any more. I started panicking and told my brother not to come over. I looked all around in the water for them but they were no were to be seen. I told my brother and he called my dad. My dad and mom were on there way to bring me a pair of shorts because their was no way I was getting out of the water with no shorts on.   I had a blast at @ORGANIZATION1 and I have a great story that I will be telling for the rest of my life. I cant wait to go back next year and i know that I will be bringing an super tight shorts to go tubing in."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21253	8	" Laughter is the best way to bring people closer together. It creates a bond that makes you feel a little more comfortable and secure. Life would be sad and depressing if there was no such thing as laughter. Everyone has a different type of laugh some peoples are loud, quiet,weird, or funny.But our laughter is what makes us who we are.  There are so many effects in the process of laughing.Your laugh can have such a strong effect on your body that it can cause your eyes to become a little teary. Sometime when u laugh its also harder to breath and your stomach might start to hurt. When somethings really funny I usually have a hard time to get another gasp of air because i cant stop laughing.That's one of the effects that happens to me while I'm laughing. Everyone knows that when someone thinks somethings funny they laugh. We can laugh at a movie, a joke,or even a simple mistake.My family always makes me laugh.When we have party's were always laughing and cracking up jokes.One of the jokes that my cousins said is that my aunts baby was so white that it look like a came out of la lechera. Lechera is a @CAPS1 word.  Another thing that also made me laugh is when i went to my cousins house. We were watching a movie and i had to go use the restroom so i went and when i came out she jump out from around the corner and scared me. I screamed so loud that my other cousin yelled from up stairs to be quiet. I couldn't stop laughing i was scared but it was funny because she scared me out of nowhere and i never expected her to do that. I think of laughing as a gift. It is something that can always brighten our day.I love to laugh and there's so many unforgettable moments were i almost laughed till i peed my pants.I think the people with the best personality are the people who can make someone else laugh."	19	20	40	40				3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4

We all know that every relationship needs a heaping dosage of medicine every once and a while.  @CAPS3 younger brother, @PERSON1, and I, we have a pretty good relationship. Sometimes we argue, other times we can get along like we are the best of friends. When we were going to the same school together, I would go out of @CAPS3 way to say hi to @CAPS3 brother. Almost every time I would get shut down and ignored, by @CAPS3 own brother. @PERSON1 is going to be a freshman next year and I will be a junior, so we will be attending high school together. One night, at the dinner table, @CAPS3 family was discussing what the change would be like with both children in high school. I brought up the fact that @PERSON1 never says hi to me or even waves at me and how I didn't really appreciate it.  Some how we got to talking about how he would be known as @LOCATION1's brother because I am so awesome. The next thing I know @PERSON1 blurted out, ""yeah, @LOCATION1, I'm going to embarrass you because I am so butt-ugly."" @CAPS3 parents and I looked at each other and instantly started laughing and couldn't stop! When we had semi regained our composure, we asked @PERSON1 why he would say something like that about himself. @PERSON1 said he didn't really know why he said that, he thought it would be funny. Yes, @PERSON1, it was!! It was @CAPS3 turn to pray for dinner that night. As much and as hard as I tried to compose myself long enough to pray, I couldn't do it. Every time I thought I had pulled myself together again, I would start busting up yet again. After a while, @CAPS3 parents asked me what was wrong. I replied, ""I was going to ask @CAPS4 to make @PERSON1 more beautiful so he wouldn't embarrass me."" I started laughing so hard that I was crying. I couldn't see anything because the tears had blurred @CAPS3 vision. Now, after what I said, it took me twice as long to control @CAPS3 laughter. @CAPS3 parents calmed down before I did, so @CAPS3 mom had to pray because I couldn't contain myself. The whole time @CAPS3 mom was praying, I had to clamp @CAPS3 hand over @CAPS3 mouth to keep from laughing. @CAPS3 grip was so hard that it made @CAPS3 teeth hurt. That night I think @CAPS3 whole family got a few spoonfuls of medicine. Probably enough to last us another week or so. I can't wait until I get 'sick' again and need another serving of medicine!

21285	8	" High school years are tough for many teenagers if you don't have a friend that is always willing to put a smile on your face during the worst times. I had a great friend named @PERSON1. She had that special power of making me laugh no matter what. We stopped being each others friends around the end of our sophmore year. It was both our faults for letting our friendship come to a closer. It wasn't like we made enemys with each other. But we didn't end our friendship so nice and peacefully.  The @DATE1 going into my junior year i had forgotten why we weren't friends anymore. If I didn't remember why we weren't friends anymore, then obviously it was a stupid thing to fight about. But things were said to one another. So it would be a lot harder to make-up. I really didn't want to be the one to apologise first. I did the worst thing to our friendship and just let it stay like that. It was the first day of my junior year. I hadn't seen one sign of @PERSON1 anywhere. It worried me because I thought she might of moved away and I didn't get the chance to say good-bye to her. Lunch had past and that is when I mostly saw everyone. And there was still no sign of her anywhere. As I walked to my last class of the day, I was seated in the front row. Once I was settled there walked in @LOCATION1. I had a little smirk on my face knowing she was still she hadn't moved away. She turned to look at me with a serious look. For that one sceond I had forgotten we weren't friends. My face bacame serious as well. It was great knowing she was still living here, but horrible knowing we still hadn't made peace with each other. But I didn't want to be the one to apoligise first, beacause I knew she would think I was the one to blame. So leaving it like that was all I could think of. The semester went by really fast. Seeing her everyday during class made it harder for me to even be in there. I lost a really good friend from something I don't even remember. I've noticed she's made new friends and has moved on with our friendship. She still once in a while hung out with my group of friends. When we both joined cheerleading we saw each other more after school. But we still didn't talk. It really felt like she was acting as if I never was a part of her life. At first I hated her for treating me that way. But I also had to take responsiblitie for what I had done to her.  One night I felt so out of it. I really needed a friend that could just let me forget about my problems and bring a smile to my face. The only person that came to mind was @PERSON1. I felt very alone at that time. So I decided to write her an e-mail. It would have been better to have aid it to her face but I know I would have chickened out if I did it face to face. So an e-mail was better than nothing. I told her I was wrong about a lot of the things that came out of my mouth. I told her how much I missed her friendship and how much I missed her presents around me. I woke up the next morning feeling very sick to my stomach. I didn't want to go to school but I did anyways.  During lunch time I sat at my usual place in the hall. @PERSON1 came out of no where and sat next to me. She smiled and said ""remember when you tripped in the @NUM1 grade?"" I could not stop laughing when she said that. Tears came down face face for how hard I was laughing. It felt like its been forever since I laughed that hard. We talked a lot about our summers and about what news have been happening in our lives. We laughed more than we talked. I really had my funny best friends back. And the laughs can go on again."	17	20		37				4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21290	8	" Laughter is a Element of @CAPS1  Laughter is a huge element of @CAPS1, without laughter @CAPS1 wouldn't be what it is today. Laughing is actually a element of why I am in my relationship with my boyfriend as of right now. I also believe ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" Someone once said. Laughter also breaks the ice with people either when their mad, sad, or just meeting the person. Also laughter can bring two people very close together. Here is a true story about how laughter is a element of @CAPS1. One day while I was with my best friend @PERSON1, we met up with her cousin @CAPS2 friend's @PERSON2 and @PERSON3. @PERSON2 and I started talking and hanging out a lot that night. I'm a very shy person but he kept making me laugh. This is no love story but he making me laugh broke the wall I had put up because I was shy and very uncomfortable. The more we laughed together the more closer i felt to him and comfortable I was around him. Eventually we started dating. Too this day we are still together and we have a very strong relationship because of laughter, if it wasn't for the laughter @PERSON2 and I would not be as close as we are now. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I believe that because laughter gives you that feeling of security, like the sense that it is okay to be your self around strangers. Laughing makes you feel warm and invited to have fun. Makes you feel like at this moment your bonding with this person. It doesn't make you feel uncomfortable when using laughter for the right reason, for example breaking the ice with someone or just meeting someone that can bring them closer. Breaking the ice with laughter. Meeting someone for the first time can be very uncomfortable for some people making conversation and laughing could do that trick to make them feel not so shy and set back to talking. When I first meet people I am very shy until someone makes me laugh then I am very comfortable. Sometimes making people laugh when they are sad or mad could also bring you very close with someone. But laughter could always push you away from someone. When I was upset about me and my ex fiance breaking up for the first time after year and a half no one for a day or two could make me happy. My best friend @PERSON1 brought me out to the state fair, being on the rides and laughing with her, brought her and I closer also I was not mad anymore. She broke that anger and hurt inside of me just by laughing. A huge element of @CAPS1 is laughter, there is no doubt about that. Depending on the persons perspective laughing @MONTH1 not be a element of @CAPS1 to them but to me it is. With out the feeling of security when laughing with @PERSON2 we wouldn't be as close as we are now. With out laughter @PERSON1 and I wouldn't feel as warm and comfortable as we are together. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Someone once said. @CAPS1 would be a whole lot different without this element of laughter. "	17	20		37				4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21295	8	" It has been said that ""Laughter is the spark of the soul."" I agree with this statement wholeheartedly. Laughter can do wonders for the soul; it truly does ignite a spark. And once that spark has been ignited watch out, it will burn like a wild fire. As the fire burns it will go on a rampage throughout the the body. First its that uncontrollably smile that brings an ache to your cheeks, then the butterflies that marvelously flutters through your stomach, next comes the tingling sensation deep within your toes, and last but not least the tears of joy come streaming from your eyes. Had these feelings before? That'@CAPS5 the rampage I'm talking about; let the fire burn.  Laughter is an extraordinary thing--it can turn an awkward or embarrassing situation into a much more relaxed one. Unfortunately, in my story about laughter I wasn't the one laughing...About three weeks ago while my sister was at gymnastics, my mom, my best friend @CAPS1, and I went to visit my grandparents and to see how the work on our new barn was progressing. After spending sometime at their house it was time to pick up my sister, @CAPS2. My grandpa ever so kindly offered to go pick her up but then I mentioned that @CAPS1 and I could go do it. As we were driving to town in my grandpas @LOCATION1, everything seemed fine; just another ordinary day. After we had arrived at the gymnastics center we headed inside and waited for @PERSON1 to finish. However, as we were walking out my sister said she was hungry and asked me to stop at @ORGANIZATION1. I pulled up to the order board and ordered her food. The lady then asked me to drive around to the first window to pay. After doing as she asked, I received my change, put the truck in drive, and began pulling forward--when all of the sudden I heard a loud crunch! My heart dropped as I looked in my side mirror. I hadn't pulled out far enough and had hit the side of the building.  Now before I go on I just want you to know that I have been driving since I was about seven and am usually a very good driver. But hey, that first crash happens to all of us, right? Well back to my story, as I was driving back to my grandparents house it took everything I had not to cry. After we arrived back at their house @CAPS1 and I ran into the house and got a cup of hot water, soap, toothbrushes, and a @CAPS5.O.@CAPS5. pad. We scrubbed and scrubbed until all the red paint from the side of the the building was gone. The dent didn't look so bad once the paint was gone and the truck was back to white. I was absolutely terrified to tell my grandparents about the truck! After waiting about an hour I finally got up the courage to tell them what had happened. My grandpa put on his shoes and we went out to look at the damage. As I started crying because I felt so bad, my grandpa just started laughing and reminding me that it was just a truck and it can be fixed.The fact that he just laughed really made the situation a lot less stressful. Laughter brings people together and creates bonds that will last a lifetime. So no matter if you're laughing about something that makes you happy or a situation that maybe isn't so good, let the fire burn."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
21297	8	"  It all started at the play ground @CAPS9 me my friend @PERSON3 and @PERSON2 were just sitting around and we saw these two girls walk up and it was these girls from school @PERSON1 and @CAPS1. We didn't know who it was at first so we sat back all cool like tell i noticed it was them @CAPS9 they got closer. They ran up and said ""hey guys want to go on a adventure to the woods"" ""sure why not"" we all said ""we ain't got nothing better to do so we walked which seemed like @NUM1 miles @CAPS9 it was only @NUM2 feet from the play ground it felt like a long way either way i was lazy at the time.  @CAPS9 we got into the @CAPS2 it had a lot of bushes and trees that we thought we could make a fort out of bushes and chill and eat donuts from @ORGANIZATION1 there but what we didn't know was there was something living in that @CAPS2 that we were not aware of. Turns out we went into the wrong @CAPS2 and there was a lot of animals in the place we went into. So as i was sitting on the long by the creek i saw a brownish figure walk by deep into to the woods them closet person to me was @PERSON1 and i jumped up and grabbed her and from there i knew were going on adventure to go find whatever was living out there. @CAPS9 we started walking all i could see was trees and bushes tell i heard @PERSON1 say ""there is something over there by the big tree with vines so we approached the tree with caution not knowing what was going to happen. We stood behind a little fallen over log that was there for awhile.As we watched the big tree and the huge hollow hole that was in the side of it we heard a loud growling nose from inside the tree i got up from behind the tree and went over to check it out but before i could take a step @PERSON1 grabbed my jacket and told it look to dangerous ""alright"" i said with disappointment cause i really want to go see what was in that tree. We started walking back to get the others turns out they have been looking for us for over @NUM3 minutes ""sorry"" we both said"" but you guys have to check this out @CAPS7 so narly"" i said with animosity. ""@CAPS5 what is it"" @PERSON3 said ""don't know but it sounds big and scary and mean"" said @PERSON1 "" ""oh daaanngg"" @PERSON2 said ""i think were gonna die if we got back over there"" @CAPS1 complained. ""@CAPS7 gonna be just fine"" i said so we all looked at each other alright everyone said in a scared voice. ""@CAPS8 is gonna be alright trust me i know a spot were we can watch the tree without getting close to the animal or whatever is in there""I said   @CAPS9 we were walking down there to go see the animal @CAPS1 didn't want to go see the animal anymore so we argued for a little bit then we all came to a agreement that @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 stay up the hill a little ways and we will run back if anything is wrong. We got behind the tree and watched the tree me @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 didnt know what to see or wait for @CAPS9 something would come out of that tree.  I could not wait any longer it was begining to take forever then i got up and said ""lets go see what is in that tree"" ""im with you so lets @NUM4 said. We walking around the tree keeping our distance @CAPS9 we heard that growling noise again we backed off a little bit but kept going we got a little bit closer @CAPS9 i saw something some out of the tree. It was a huge mountain loin we ran as fast as we could up the hill. I was looking back trying to follow the sound of screaming from @LOCATION1 but @CAPS9 i looked up it was really @PERSON3 i could not help laughing @CAPS9 we got @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 i kept laughing all the way to @ORGANIZATION1. As soon as we got into @ORGANIZATION1 we were all out of breath especially me cause i could not stop laughing about @PERSON3 and how i thought he was @PERSON1 cause he was screaming like a girl. ""@CAPS13 up"" he said ""that wasn't me it was @PERSON1"" even though @PERSON1 was running beside me the hole time. We walked into a little more into @ORGANIZATION1 and there was a big box of donuts sitting right by the deli and we ran over there and got two box's which had a total of @NUM5 donuts in them then we got a big gallon of soda and chilled in @ORGANIZATION1 and ate the hole thing in @NUM6 minutes. I will always remember that day as one of the craziest days of my life. "	15	17		32				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3						
21298	8	"  One stormy winter night my girlfriend and I wanted to go to dinner, so we did. When we got there the restaurant was almost full so we got a table fast. While waiting for food we started talking about our friends and having a good time. I then said something really mean about someone she knew and did not know it. She got really upset and stormed out of the place leaving me alone. I finally got up and went home after paying to bill for the food I did not eat.  The next mourning I got up and started cleaning up the house, mowing the yard and doing all my chores. She came over to my house and apologized for what she did, so I apologized for saying something mean about one of her friends. I told her that I will call her after my chores where done and go out for lunch. Finally I finished the chores, took a shower, and got dressed. I then called her and told her to meet me at the restaurant of her choice.   About an hour later she shows up finds me waiting for at the table farthest from the door. She then sat down and asked if I was going to be mean again. I said that I will be nice and considerate today and not be mean. I then proceeded to tell her about a funny memory. She laughed and tell told me one. This went on until we left. Up until she broke up with me for my friend, laughter was to one thing that held us together."	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21299	8	" Laughter is said that it is the medicine for happiness. Those who laugh frequently end up having an overall better life. They are in better moods throughout the @DATE1 and affect people around them with their upbeat mood. Many solid friendships involve laughing frequently. I am lucky to have friends that never cease to make me or each other laugh. Their was one time when we all laughed intently at my house late at @TIME1.  My freshmen in high school was my second year total in public school because I was previously home schooled by my parents. I just established friendships with four other people earlier that year. They were my friends @PERSON4, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3. None of us ever been to eachother's houses yet, so I suggested to be the first one to all have them over on a @DATE1. We did not know yet exactly what we wanted to do at my house, but we knew with our creativity we could find anything to entertain us. As they came over one by one we watched football on the @CAPS1 until the entire gang was at the house. Once the last person, @PERSON2, came to my house we all went outside to find something to do. All of us are football players so we decided to play some backyard football. Unfortunately all of us were linemen except for @PERSON4. The problem was that we had what is called ""linemen hands"" which means that we could not catch a football due to having hard hands. This created quite a spectacle of a bunch of linemen trying to be wide receivers. We ended up not finishing the game because it was way to funny.  Later that @TIME1 we all decide to grab the immense amount of junk around my property ,and like most boys our age, started to fight with them. This battle continued for most the @TIME1 and people got hit in the funniest of ways. After we were all tired from the running around we decided to make scary movie with my mom's video camera. This is when the most laughter of the whole @TIME1 came. We all sat down to make out a plot for our movie and kept distorting it in different ways to come to some agreement on what to base it off of. We decided to make the movie seem like it was off of ""@CAPS2-field"", a movie about aliens invading earth, but we replaced the aliens with a psychopath chasing us. As we began the movie all seemed like it was following the script perfectly. Unfortunately we found out that we could not act at all when the first serious scene came up. @PERSON4 was supposed to be on the ground with a gash down his side when we found him, but when we filmed that scene @PERSON4, who was supposed to be unconscious, could not keep a straight face when we found him. Since he had a goofy smile when we picked him up and with the awkwardly said line from @PERSON3 ""The window is open, @PERSON2 is gone"" we all started to burst out laughing. After we calmed down we went to film the next scene where we wake @PERSON4 up and try to find out what happened. @PERSON4 said ""I'm hurt really bad! I think I need an ambulance"" and then @PERSON1 responded ""@CAPS3 that's not gonna happen!"". That line that @PERSON1 said was not in the script and was just way to funny to keep it in and in a result we all started bursting out laughing once again. We tried to redo the scene, but when I said ""@CAPS4 are you laughing"" we all burst right back into uncontrollable laughing. Later in the movie the last guys alive were @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and me. We were casing the psychopath outside in the pitch-black dark. Randomly @PERSON4 and @PERSON2 run in front of the camera when they were not supposed to. This caused us to laugh yet again because of the way the short fat one ran. After all the scenes were done and we finished the movie, we all went back into my living room, spooked from being outside in the dark for so long making a scary movie. My sister randomly comes home without us noticing. She stares through the locked front door with out making a sound in a very creepy way until we all notice her. We all jumped about ten feet in the air due to being extremely scared. After we settled down we all joined in the laughing once again as we looked back and saw how stupid we were.  In conclusion, the laughing that went on throughout @TIME1 made us closer as friends. Every time we get together at my house we look at that tape and remember the good times and laugh until we cry. The benefit of laughter in my life was being able to create a strong bond with now my best friends. My life is truly blessed that way. END "	20	21		41				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	5	4	4	4						
21300	8	" Bright blue waves of morning light streamed over the hill tops as the waking sun began to rise to its daily position. The crisp, chill air arose the slumbering birds. Soon, the dusk setting transformed into a vibrant morning where the birds chattered with their mellifluous tone of song. Gentle breezes swept through the trees causing the leaves to dance. The green grass appeared to flow like an ocean while the cracked gravestones remained stationary; just as anchored ships at sea. Any spectator @MONTH1 agree that this particular graveyard scene presents a prodigious feeling; however, when one is to catch a glimpse of the stoical man who stands before the silent tombstone, the spectator's heart fills with empathy and despair. Motionless, young @PERSON1 stood before the tombstone. The gentle, but quick breeze began to accelerate into a harsh wind. @PERSON1's teary eyes and wet face began to dry. Although the windy weather was not uncommon for @PERSON2, @LOCATION1, a long lost memory interrupted @PERSON1's thought for an unknown reason. For a split moment, his mind drifted back to sixteen years ago when @CAPS5 was still alive. His eyes closed as the wind began to calm. He could nearly hear her voice.  ""@CAPS1, I would like you to meet someone,"" @CAPS5 yelled from upstairs. It was @DATE1, and six-year-old @PERSON1 came zealously running up the stairs. Breathing rapidly, he arrived at the top of the creaky stair case and skipped to his parent's room. ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3?"" he asked as he began to turn the cold, brass door knob. He opened the door just a crack and peered into the room. His blue eyes sparkled with curiosity. He observed how the mid-wife gracefully glided to his mother's bedside to prop her head up with another pillow. His attention then altered to his father who was sitting on the edge of the bed cradling a small bundle of pink blankets. ""@CAPS4 hello to your new baby sister,""said @PERSON1's mother. Still clutching the brass knob, @PERSON1 pushed open the door with the palm of his left hand. The door moaned as @PERSON1 began to place the tip of his @CAPS7 light-up sneaker onto the roan colored carpet in his parent's bedroom. Carefully and cautiously, he advanced to the foot of his parent's bed where his father sat. He stood in front of his father with wide eyes. ""@CAPS5 was born less that an hour ago,"" said his father. @PERSON1 then looked to the heap of pink blankets. He nervously reached out his clammy hand and gently pinched the top layer of blankets to uncover the face of his little sister. All was silent except for the wind outside. Inch-by-inch, he slowly began to peal back the top blanket; but, before @PERSON1 could even finish this task, the new-born baby let out a startling exhale. @PERSON1 lurched back and slammed against the bedroom door. His father jumped because of @PERSON1's reaction, but was careful no to wake the baby. @PERSON1 felt as if his heart was about to jump out of his chest. Wide-eyed and out of breath, he looked to his mother. To @PERSON1's surprise, he found his mother quite amused. The corners of her moth began to curl up and a slight giggle leaked out. Soon enough, both his parents were immersed in a hypnotic laughter; their bodies shaking rhythmically. @PERSON1 began to relax and smiled at this mother. ""@CAPS6 @CAPS5 scare you a little?"" @CAPS5 asked. His father chimed in, I would think so!"" The three of them laughed for the next five minutes while the mid-wife simply smiled and the baby lay sound asleep in the strong arms of her father.  @PERSON1 could feel the overwhelming essence of reality rushing back to him; just as the wind flowed through his brown hair. He missed her. He cried for her. He wished @CAPS5 could of won the ferocious battle fought between the human body and cancer; but, @CAPS5 didn't. Now @CAPS5 was gone. He would never see his mother on @LOCATION2 again. Although this memory succeeded in bringing him sadness, it failed to push @PERSON1 into depression. Instead, he suddenly recalled an ancient saying: ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS7 then, @PERSON1 suddenly realized how unbelievably close he was to his precious mother. He possessed eight years of memories made with his mother and many of these memories involved laughter. @PERSON1 tilted his head to the sun as tears of joy rushed down his face. Now he understood the fact that love is never dependent on time. Granted, he only knew his mother for a small chapter of his life; however, the memories made and laughter shared still continues to engulf @PERSON1 with his mother's love.   In my mind, @PERSON1 is classified as a superior individual. As I am his only full sister, he never fails to educate me of his past memories with our mother. I love her and miss her, but know I will see her again someday; and when I do, we will be bound together with joy and laughter. "	23	21		44				5	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	5	5	5	4						
21307	8	"                             laughter      why do people have so much trouble trying to laugh?Is laughter a healthy thing you should have in your health chart?This are some questions you might    ask yourself.But when you do have you thought of yourself, and maby have you thought of how much you and your family laugh all together at the dinner table or maby the family room anywere as long as you hear laughter coming out of your mouth.It doesn't matter an what you laugh about, it can be one of your family members telling a joke or even a funny show or a funny commercial. it doesnt matter as long as you laugh.in my opinion laughter is an important part in your life.if you dont laugh then you must be a very seriouse person or you might even think that the world is a very boring place to be in.some how i cant really imagine a person never laughing in their life. Some examples of people that dont really laugh anymore is probably a person that lost someone close to them or that just doesnt have anybody to tell jokes with in my opinion you have to have someone to share stuff with or that will tell you jokes when your in a really bad mood.I always used to remember my mom telling my little brother an i to quiet sown whaen we would talk in the family table during dinner one day. One day i went to school and i went into health class it was weird because the teacher was talking about how we should share stuff in the dinner table and have some laughing moments. So when i got home a told my mother all about what the teacher had taught us during health class. She said ok and we tried it .It really was a good experience we were all laughing telling jokes all the time and since then we tell jokes in the family table. It really does give you some energy sometimes but at the same time if you laugh way too much your stomach will eventually start hurting.Like i told you in the first paragraph theres many different ways you can laugh for example if you watch a comody show i very good idea would be @PERSON1 that show always mekes me crack up sometimes my mom thinks im crazy. Or ever family @CAPS1 thats such a great show to watch wene your really in a bad mood. Another way to make someone laugh is telling jokes theres the knock knock shows and then theres the guess what i am jokes . but one way your really going to make somebody really laugh is tikling that always works theres no way you cant ever make someone laugh. Eather have someone always do it for you because i know that you cant do it to yourself that would be really weird or have a @CAPS2 see who laughs first contest.It wont always help you with your problems all the way but it will make you feel good for a little bit it will really make you forget about the bad things for a while. I heard tha t if you laugh alot suposlly you live longer so i think it does help you with your problems."	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21309	8	" Some people say that laughter is the best medicine. I strongly agree with these people, because I believe that any funny situation in which there is laughter can put anyone into a better mood. Just taking the time to laugh at something or yourself is something that every person should do. Having agood time with friends and family and laughing with them is truly something to be greatful for. I have had several situations filled with laughter. @CAPS2 I am greatful for. My two best friends, @PERSON2@NUM1, and I, well lets just say there is hardly a time when we are together that there is not laughter involved. So many times we've laughed at ourselves and each other I've lost count. It's so amazing to have these two great friends to laugh along with. There are so many times that we have laughed at eachother I don't even know where to begin. One time we were all at @ORGANIZATION1's house and we were playing hide and seek in her back yard. It was my turn to be the seeker. I came out of the house after counting to @NUM2. As I searched the yard I found everyoneeventually, except @PERSON2. As I wondered the yard looking for her the others started helping me look for her.We could hear her laughter coming from somewhere, but we couldn't tell where. She started talking to us saying things like ""@CAPS1 here!"" or ""@CAPS2 way!"". After getting frustrated and giving up, she finally revealed herself...on the roof of her house! We all laughed so hard, not even knowing how she got up there in the firstplace.  Another time we had gone to pizza for my @NUM3 birthday party. We went into the arcade room with the moneywe had ready to play some games. We told ourselves to avoid the claw machine, because we knew we would not want to stop and waste all of our money. But of course @ORGANIZATION2 had to try it just once. Next thing we, knewwe were using all of our money trying to win at @CAPS2 game. We each eventually won something, screaming, cheering, and laughing hysterically like kindergartners. We had also played @CAPS2 race car game at least ten timesand we were running out of games to play. So to relieve our boredom we started playing the race car game driving with our feet instead of our hands. It was a very fun time.  I couldn't possibly tell all of these stories. That would take hours, days, maybe even weeks. But I can tell youthat laughter is definitely a huge part of our day to day lives. I consider myself a very lucky person to have suchgreat friends that laughter is such a common thing for us. Not a lot of people are fortunate enough to have thisopportunity. A little laughter can go a long way. So the next time you see someone who looks like they need a friend or like they could just use a good laugh, talk to them, attempt to be their friend, make them laugh. The resultwill be its own reward. Trust me."	20	18		38				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	4						
21322	8	" Folded In @DATE1 it was right around @DATE2, two of my friends and I were out riding quads laughing and having a great old time. They were teaching me how to do a wheelie on a quad. Soon after they started teaching me i figured out that what I had to do was hit all of my weight on the back end of the quad and f lore the gas so I could pop the front end up and I was just doing it fairly well from there on out. Well, when we were about ready to to go back up to the house one of my friends thought it would be super cool if we got a picture of one of us up on the front of the quad while the person driving pops a wheelie. To do this one of us sat on the front of the quad, one of us sat on the back of the quad and, one of us was driving. first thing we do when were all situated in the quad is that the driver pulls back a f lore's the quad (the driver doesn't need to slam down on the back of the quad because there is the extra weight from the person on the back)Which in turn pops the front end up. Then the person on the back jumps off and snaps a picture on their phone and then the person driving is supposed to brake and set the quad down. Lucky me I was the one that decided to sit on the front of the quad while my friend does a wheelie. While he was popping the wheelie either he pulled back to far and hard or he flored it for too long. So I was sitting on the front and it stayed up in the air for about five seconds and then the scary thing happened. The quad started leaning back so my friend jumped off and tried to hold it so I had some time to jump off but, I panicked and froze to the bar i was holding on to. Then the whole quad came down on me because my friend couldn't hold me up any longer. It slammed me into the ground, all @NUM1 lbs. of it, it caused my shins to hit me in the face( I have a hard time bending my head to my knees let alone my shins)and it super hyper-extended my back so much that I was lucky I didn't break it. When it hit me into the ground it felt like my legs sprung the quad off of myself but, it was really just my friend pushing it off. After the pushed the quad off of me I was laying there for like @NUM2 minutes laughing in pain for some reason that I can't remember.  After I was done screaming, yelling, and laughing in pain I got up and they drove me back up to the house. When we got back up there they handed me an ice pack and told me to go sit on the couch, I couldn't bend my back so I could sit down so I had to turn my back to the couch and basically fall onto the couch. While I was sitting there my back started to hurt excruciatingly bad so i thought if I lay flat on the floor it wouldn't hurt as bad and just like I thought it did. So I slept on the floor until morning because that was the only way I could get comfortable. The next day I woke up in really bad pain, it took me like two minutes to get off the floor it hurt so bad. shortly after I woke up I called my parents and had them come and pick me up from the house, I just barely got into the truck and my dad and I drove back to my house and i told my parents the whole story and my mom freaked out and thought I hurt myself extremely bad so she took me to the doctors office and he looked me over and told me I would just have to wait for my back to heal it's self and then i went home.

21327	8	"  I was in @NUM1 grade; when it was almost the last day of school so since middle school years have been the lamest years of my life. I thought of my brothers pranks he had done while he was in middle school and one of them that was the funnest was the fire alarm prank. He told me the story to me all the time and that he did it a lot of times and also got away with it. I know I should at least try it since this was my last year in middle school and I should just go for it. well @NUM2 days before school was out I had a lighter with me and I had went into the girls bathroom, I noticed there was a alarm on the top of the roof so I stood on top sink and turned on the lighter, waved it around the white round fire alarm and then once I knew it, it went off. My friend was with me at the time I was thinking about it and told her before i did what i was going to do at the time and so she knew what i was about to do. But anyways back to what had happened... We all went outside, me and my friend were laughing so hard that everyone was looking at us with weird faces but then we told our closest friends what I had done and they all cracked up, even some lower grade kids herd about it but that's because they were by us and at the end it didn't get pretty. It was last period and I was in computer class when my vice principal came and got me from class then took me into her room and she asked me if I was the person who turned off the fire alarm and I was like no then asked me again and I still said no. Finally she told me that when I was doing whatever I was doing to make it go off; did I notice if there were people in the stalls at that time? I said no and she told me that there were two people in there and one of them had told on me. So it ended up with me getting in big trouble with being on probation, going to the fire department to apologize for what I had did and how much time it takes for them to do there job on fires at school, then had community service the whole @DATE1, and almost didn't get to walk in my promotion with the @DATE2 class which got me down. I do regret doing what I had done since I think of it all now, it was something childish and stupid. For some reason it was my funniest moment of my life and I'll always have that as one of my @NUM3 top favorite memories and moments of any school year.

21329	8	"My story about laughter is going to be a true story about me. This story is about my trip to the doctors. I love to play sports always have, always will. Iv been playing football for about @NUM1 years now and iv never been hurt, except one pracitce. It was in @NUM2 grade. My football team always does one hitting drill once a week. The drill is called truck and trailer. Its where you have @NUM3 people. Two people on offence and two peole on defense. The two people on offence are trying to score and the two people on defence are trying to stop them. Of course I get stuck with running the ball and not to mention the worst person on the whole team blocking for me. This kid couldn't do anything on the football field other then keep the bench warm. The two biggest and best hitters were on defence trying to kill me. I knew that this was going to be bad. All I could do was run fast, so i do. My coach (my dad) hikes the ball and I take off. Soon enough they catch up with me and take me off my feet. One went high and the other went low. I hit the ground and stayed down. I hear my teammates start screaming. I thought it was because i got ''cracked"". I thought wrong. I sit up and my knee kinda hurts. I look at it and it looks like rubber. My leg was pointing the opposite way that it's supposed to go. Iv only seen a brake like that on tv and youtube. My dad doesnt hesitate too call @NUM4. The ambulance came to the field @NUM5 minutes later. They came down to the field and put my on a strecher. My team wasnt the only team that used that field. About @NUM5 other teams practiced at the same time. All eyes were on me. And on my leg. The other teams didnt know what happened except that they had a big ice back on my private area. All my friends thought I hurt my man parts. It was embarrasing and funny at the same time. When they all found out it was my leg they still woud make fun of me. I had horrible nicknames for a long time. It wasnt fun for me and especially not funny. But all my friends thought it was hilasious."	15	15		30				3	3	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3						
21331	8	" They say that ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" and I agree completely. You can't be in an relationship or have a friendship with someone and not share laughter with them. It makes things last between one another and makes both partners happy. If there's no laughter between the two, that connection will be more difficult to have.  I have a bestfriend and her names @CAPS1.

We had been jumping, standing, flipping, @CAPS6 everything you could think of but trying to do that with out falling off of it! @LOCATION1 went to go do this flip on to the ball @CAPS6 she said "" @CAPS1 @CAPS2 watch this cool thing I just did!"" @CAPS3 she try's to do the same thing she did, but she messes up, @CAPS6 the giant ball went flying out from under her! We started laughing @CAPS3 hard! It was @CAPS3 funny that she almost peed her pants! But then her older sister came in, @CAPS6 that's when it all started... @PERSON1, (@LOCATION1's older sister) was always much bigger than us @CAPS3 we did @CAPS8 she said no matter @CAPS8. As soon as she walked in we stopped @CAPS8 we were doing! She said that she wanted to play a game with us, @CAPS3 we decided to play too. @PERSON1 told us to get on the bed @CAPS6 go under the blankets. @CAPS3 we did @CAPS6 right when we did the light shut off! @CAPS6 the door slammed shut! We didn't know if she was still in the room or not @CAPS3 we didn't say a word.  The next thing you know, the door barley creeks open @CAPS6 you can see a little bit of light through the crack. She was back, @CAPS6 with supplies! It was silent for about @NUM2 minutes, then @LOCATION1 starts screaming! Right when I look over @LOCATION1 is getting dragged out of the bed by her feet. While I'm trying to bring her back up I feel someone grabbing my feet! There I go, right where @LOCATION1 is! We kept trying to hide,@CAPS6 get back up on the bed, but we eventually gave up because our plan didn't work that well. All of a sudden my feet were tied together! Then my hands @CAPS6 mouth! @PERSON1 kept throwing us around the room @CAPS6 hitting us, she thought it was the funniest thing in the whole world! She was laughing @CAPS3 hard, especially when we kept trying to get back on the bed with tied hands @CAPS6 feet.  After an hour of struggling me @CAPS6 @LOCATION1 had an idea! We thought if we hid in the bathroom she couldn't get us anymore @CAPS6 we would try to un-tie each others bandannas @CAPS6 ropes. But before we could do that @PERSON1 beat us to it! She had thrown us into the bathroom corner with the lights off! It was silent. ""@LOCATION1 @CAPS8 is that noise? "" I said. ""@CAPS4 the bath!"" she said. We tried to get out, but right when we did, @PERSON1 picked us up @CAPS6 threw us in! She was laughing the whole time! While we were screaming yelling for each other. @CAPS6 for help!   When we got out of the bathtub she threw us back up on the bed @CAPS6 finally untied our bandannas @CAPS6 ropes! After she turned the light back on we looked at our wrists @CAPS6 ankles @CAPS6 there was red marks all over them. @LOCATION1 said ""@CAPS5! Your crazy, we told you to stop @CAPS6 you didn't!"" @CAPS6 right after she screamed that @LOCATION1's @CAPS7 walks in. ""@CAPS8 is all the yelling for girls?"" @CAPS6 then it all came out! In the end @ORGANIZATION1 got in trouble @CAPS6 we got out of it. @LOCATION1 @CAPS6 I learned a huge lesson. Never ""play a game"" with your older sister when she has bandannas @CAPS6 ropes!"	16	18		34				3	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
21345	8	"Laughters importance in human life   In life there are many things that make a person happy but none come close to the joy of laughter. @CAPS1 and friends always come together and share a good laugh, it's why we get together, to have a great time with the ones we love and enjoy being around. My @CAPS1 every year gets together on thanksgiving and it is always one of my favorite times becuase when my @CAPS2 shows up he really knows how to make you laugh until you drop to the floor crying becuase you are laughing so hard. He has that sense of knowing how people work and he knows that a smile and a laugh could turn someones bad day into a fantastic day. @CAPS1 is the greatest thing someone could ask for and when every one is together it only makes the time sweeter, now add a laugh, a few smiles and you have yourself a great time! My @CAPS2 has so many jokes and corny lines that he can use to to try and make somebody laugh but its not just what he says that makes it so funny, it is the timeing in which he does it. I wish to learn from him and use his people skills to return the favor and help people have a better day just by sharing a good laugh and put a bit smile on there face becuase not only does it make them feel good but it also can make yourself feel better knowing that you just helped somebody else have a better day just by telling a small joke or saying something funny that got there attention enough, and you never know taht person could one day turn back and remember what you did for them and tell somebody else and then it's a domino affect. He/she will tell somebody about what happened it and they will make somebody else's day better just by a small and simple laugh.  Most friendships and relationships start with laughter because one of you had the confidence to break the ice with one another, sometimes thats all it takes to start a friendship that will last a lifetime. So every one can share a good laugh, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from everybody is subject to a ""hoot and a holler"" every now and then. When I met now my best friend who is like a brother to me, it all started with a joke that brought a smile to both of our faces and an unforgetable laugh. From that day to now we are the best of friends that life could have handed us, so all it takes is for you to want to really go out and just be yourself and make somebody laugh.  Laughter is the greatest thing in life that people need to do every day to keep their spirits high and lively no matter the circumstances that your in. The military has to go to war and live in an hostile inviroment but they still find time to sit down as a unit and share a drink and luagh about something. It is in our blood to enjoy life so don't try to avoid people or the luaghter that wants to come out. When your having a terrible day the best thing to do is go to a buddies house and just hang out becuase the people that truely care about you will find a way to enliven your spirit and make you laugh which will bring a smile to your face and whole new start to the day, it's like a refreshment for your body. When i am having a bad day all i have to do is think about something that me and a friend did that was funny and it will bring either a smile across my face or laugh coming out and sometimes both. Laughter is the key to life becuase it can turn anything negative into a positive. When you go to a party with @CAPS1 or friends do you sit in the back and think about nothing, no you get up and have a great time with your friends and always end sharing a good laugh with somebody.  I believe with all my heart that laughter is not just the key to life but the key to the inside a person, it shows who they are becuase nobody can hide or shake the want to laugh at something funny, it's just not possible for somebody to do. Laughter comes from the heart and the soul inside a person and those two things alone are very powerful and when they want to sing and rejoice which comes out as laughter you can't deny the need. When two or more people are gathered the ability to create an enviroment where anyone can be themselves and enjoy the laugh not just fake it it what every person looks for so when someone said this, it is so true ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people""."	15	17		32				3	3	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3						
21347	8	" It was @DATE1. The day was beautiful and full of happy faces. A perfect day to be at the fair. I was sitting on a bench next to @PERSON1 this guy I really liked, but I doubted @CAPS6 liked me of course. I had caught him staring at me a couple of times and I just thought I had something on my face that really cached his attention, like a piece of food since we had just at a couple minutes before or something. I looked at him and asked ""@CAPS1?""""@CAPS2"" @CAPS6 said with a huge smile on his face.""@CAPS3 tell me @CAPS1 @CAPS14 funny"" I demanded throwing a smile back at him.""@CAPS2 is funny, but.."" @CAPS6 paused for a moment.""@CAPS5 can i ask @CAPS13 out?"" @PERSON1 asked. I felt my face turn red, my body temperature raised and my leg began to move without control. ""@CAPS6 cant know I have strong feelings for him"" I thought to my self. ""@CAPS7 just play it off like @CAPS10 hes joking..because @CAPS6 is joking right?""""@CAPS8 @PERSON2? are @CAPS13 okay?"" @CAPS6 asked as @CAPS6 put his hand on my lap.""@CAPS9 I'm fine, its just.."" I paused for a long time.""@CAPS10 @CAPS13 say @CAPS3 I @CAPS17 understand"" @CAPS6 said as his head slowly faced the ground. I didn't know @CAPS1 to say, I felt stuck. I wanted to say @CAPS14 much but the words wouldn't come out.""@CAPS11 don't mess with me like that, I know your joking @PERSON1"" I laughed nervously. @PERSON1 looked at me with a confused face like @CAPS10 @CAPS6 was saying ""Was I not clear enough"" or ""@CAPS12 I just walk away?"".  His smile turned into a serious expression and the glow of his eyes had disappeared. I felt something on my throat, words were stuck and they needed to come out!.""@CAPS13 can ask me out any time and my answer @CAPS17 always be @CAPS9"" I said feeling relived.""@CAPS14 does that make @CAPS13 my girlfriend @PERSON2?""""I don't know @PERSON1..@CAPS13 have not asked me out yet"" I said with a grin on my face. We looked at each other for a second and busted out laughing, like @CAPS10 it was the funniest thing in the world. I didn't fully understand why we were laughing and @CAPS6 probably didn't either, but that didn't stop us. I started feeling a cramp in my stomach from all the force I was putting on my it which maid me to stop laughing. @PERSON1 took my hand and we walked towards the roller coaster ride. In my head I imagined him kneeling down on one knee and asking me to be his girlfriend, and at that moment the noises in the background would disappear, and the camera would only be focused on us. Although that probably only happens in the end of a romantic movie were everyone lives ""happily ever after"". I looked over at @PERSON1 realizing I wasn't in a movie, I was in this place called reality. @CAPS6 was looking at me like @CAPS10 I had something on my face again, but it didn't really bother me any more. We got on the roller coaster and a few other rides, which totally made me feel like I needed to throw up. I was standing in the ticket line wen for some reason I felt this joy inside of me, like @CAPS10 I was the happiest person on this world. @CAPS2 bothered me that day not even wen something was supposed to bother me, I just ignored it because I felt like @CAPS10 it really didn't matter. I had the biggest smile on my face like @CAPS10 I had just got bot-ox and couldn't make any other expression except for that one. The sun hid behind the clouds, and the day darkened right before my eyes. I had felt like the day hadn't been long enough because of all the fun I had been having. I was starting to believe that time really does fly, even though i knew better than that. The time to go home had come and the people heading out of the fair had exhausted looks that didn't even let them smile because they were @CAPS14 worn out. @PERSON1 and I walked towards the car. As we walked @CAPS6 seemed kind of worried. ""@CAPS15 wrong @PERSON1"" I asked noticing his not @CAPS14 happy expression. ""I haven't officially asked @CAPS13 out"" @PERSON1 said. ""@CAPS16 ask me I'm ready"" I repliedJorge hurried in front of me and stopped me from walking. ""@CAPS17 @CAPS13 be my girlfriend @PERSON2..Again?"" @CAPS6 grindButterflies ran down and up my stomach, and my feet weakened. ""uhhhh..I mean @CAPS9 of course @CAPS7 be your girlfriend"" I stuttered. I guess the expression on my face was hilarious or something because @CAPS6 began to giggle. @CAPS14 i decided to laugh too even though I didn't know @CAPS1 was funny but oh well. We got in the car and drove home. On the way it was kind of quiet but it was somehow worth it. "	19	15	32	32				4	5	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	3
21351	8	"Have you ever seen the phrase @CAPS1,@CAPS2,Laughter? Have you ever asked yourself what it means? I believe it can mean many different things for many different people. There are some people that can take it negativly andthen there's some that take it positivley i believe that those @NUM1 words in that phrase are everything you need to have a perfect life. A perfect life isn't about having the best car the most expensive clothes or the nicest physical appearence. Im going to tell you why laughter is very important in any kind of relationship. Im @NUM2 years old now but i was @NUM3 when i met the person who makes me laugh no matter the situation. He is a male tall, brown skin. He is @NUM4 years old now. but he was @NUM2 when i met him.It all started at school thats where we met. He always made me laugh i remember once i was very upset because i was having some issues at home and being with him was something i needed to actually forget what was going on he is a very honest person and thats what was good about him he would make any situation into a joke. even emberassing things that either happend to me or him he would turn them around to the piont where i wouldn't feel emberassed anymore. I @CAPS1 it how i can be myself with him. He was the uphill on a rocky roll-a-coaster. @NUM1 years have gone by and i am now married with that best friend that i had and we have two beautiful twin daughets together and i @CAPS2 my life to the fullest because he makes me happy. Instead of arguing its laughter and life is just better that way not only it makes me laugh but thats what makes him a good person and other people feel good around him. Laughter not only is good in a male and female relationship but it is also good in a female and female relationship. I have a best friend. not only is she my best friend because she's honest, and kind but because she's funny she makes me laugh we can laugh at the simplist things ever most people @MONTH1 think we are crazy, we aren't that just the sound of a happy life. I believe a life without laughter is like a straight road boring and long. life with laughter is like a curvey road you just dont know what to expect. My mother and I have a pretty solid relationship we do alot of things together but what i enjoy most is the laughs we have sometimes when something occurs at that momment it might be downhill but a year from that day you look back and its funny its always better to enojy laughing with somebody that you can consider dear to you. Laughing at the memmories is what i enjoy most with anyone because that memory you will always carry with you and sooner or later you are going to laugh at the fact that it happend, when and where. So when ever something happens to you that you @MONTH1 consider emberassing look back at it a year from that day im sure you will get a laugh or atleast a smile out of it.

21357	8	"Laughter is an amazing feeling. @CAPS1 feel good, @CAPS1 feel wonderful, happy, secure, and loved. It is what brings the best out of people, in my opinion. People laugh to show a sense of humor, and to show love. I am more of a depressed person, and my therepst always told me,  ""@CAPS1 don't want wrinkles, so smile, and laugh it out.""I predict that laughing is what makes people who they really are. When @CAPS1 are mad, or even sad. What do @CAPS1 want to do? I don't think @CAPS1 would want to be grouchy all day? I would think @CAPS1 would want your friends or family make @CAPS1 laugh, so @CAPS1 can get over what your upset about, move on and be happy. In life, nothing is more important than love, and laughter. There is no love with no laughter. No laughter without love. We need one another to keep our days going. Especially for those who have been through a lot in life. Like me. I have family problems, I'm a sophomore, yet I am still standing tall with a bright smile on my face. I know, that everything will be @CAPS2 fine, @CAPS4 I @CAPS2 laugh it out. It makes me feel safe, makes me feel like, I am needed in this world. I ve have been through so much, that others look up to me. Wwhen it comes to that, I know exactly @CAPS2 what to do. Make them laugh. Nothing stands out more beautiful than a human laughing. A lot of people has always wondered how I could be so strong, because of all the horrible situations I have been through since middle school. Aand I tell them, ""@CAPS2 laugh it out. It makes @CAPS1 feel way better in the end."" I mean, @CAPS1 @MONTH1 feel silly when your done laughing, but also feel great. That @CAPS1 can @CAPS2 laugh, and move on. Because it is life. Notihng is perfect, things will get messed up, people come and go. There will be tears, and there will be laughter. When it comes to an end, let it go. Laugh, and @CAPS2 be happy that he/she was once yours. Memories last forever, cherish every moment @CAPS1 have, laugh and live life as it is, because it is too short to waste time, and frown. Laughter is the beauty of a person's voice. Some are high, and some are low. Some are loud, some are very quiet, and giggly.I have a loud mouth. Also a loud laugh. I am very tiny, yet the volume that comes out of me when I laugh makes @CAPS3 so surprised. I entertain people with my laugh, depending on my mood, my laugh will change tone. Sometimes @CAPS1 can say my laugh is annoying, but I'm not afraid to laugh. I'm not, so don't be afraid, speak out, and like text messages that @CAPS3 sends to eachother, laugh out loud. Everything will be okay. It takes a lot of strength to make me stop laughing. Because I am a ""blonde."" @CAPS3 says. No matter what, I'll always be laughing. In fourth grade my teacher once said,  ""@CAPS4 @CAPS1 laugh a lot. @CAPS1 will live life longer.""I still remember it from then on, I still, and will believe in that quote. Laughter is what makes me who I am today, and it has made me become a better, and stronger person. The most common thing that people do is laugh. @CAPS1 can walk down the hall, in the mall, next door, outside, at a park, where ever else. There will always be people lauhging, and sharing jokes all over the world. I'm glad people can speak through laughter."	20	21		41				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	4	4	4	4						
21358	8	"Laughter is a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 do things like music, tears and laughter have in common? @CAPS19're all universal languages- @CAPS19 surpass any @CAPS1 barriers to get the point across without words. @CAPS21 was definitely the case the time my @CAPS3's best friend @PERSON3 came to visit from @LOCATION2.  I was eight at the time. I'd lived in @LOCATION1 all my life, and hearing other languages wasn't something that happened on a regular basis. When my @CAPS3 announced that her college roommate @PERSON3 was coming for a few days along with her family, I felt some apprehension at the idea of trying to talk to them. However, my @CAPS3 was encouraging. ""@CAPS4 will be a learning experience!"" was her enthusiastic war cry any time I whined. ""@CAPS5'll learn some @CAPS6, and @CAPS19'll learn some @CAPS7.""  @CAPS4 was a cold, stormy @ORGANIZATION2 day when @CAPS19 arrived. As @CAPS19 pulled their blue minivan into our driveway, I @CAPS12 felt shy. After all, I only had faint memories of my ""@CAPS9"" @PERSON3's visit years ago, and I'd never met the rest of her family. However, my sense of worry was soon replaced by @CAPS9 @PERSON3's rich voice: ""@CAPS11! @CAPS5've gotten so tall!"" @CAPS12 I was enfolded in her warm embrace, and I smelled the familiar smell of my @CAPS9: chocolate, detergent, and something spicy as if she'd just been cooking. Soon @ORGANIZATION1 had moved on to greeting my younger sister and I was left awkwardly standing next to @ORGANIZATION1's three children. I realized that I didn't know @CAPS2 to say- or even how to say anything to them. While @PERSON3 was bilingual, yet she didn't speak @CAPS7 around her children. There was a total @CAPS1 barrier. The awkwardness passed momentarily when the adults intervened. @PERSON3 bustled into our silent mass and began introducing us. Her oldest was tall, dark haired @PERSON1, who was the ancient and worldly age of twelve. Closest to my age was nine year old @CAPS14, who had a quick smile and a mischievous glint in her eye. The youngest, @PERSON2, was petite even for her tender age of four. I smiled and nodded as each was introduced, and smiled and nodded some more as @PERSON3 introduced me and my sister @CAPS15 to them. As @CAPS19 chattered back at her in @CAPS6, I marveled at how clever @CAPS19 seemed for speaking another @CAPS1. How, I wondered, did my @CAPS7 sound to them?  My @CAPS3 soon ushered us into the house. She had begun making dinner, and @PERSON3 joined her in our small kitchen to ""catch up on life."" For a while, we kids stayed close to our parents, like birds hesitating to leave the nest. Soon, however, @CAPS4 became apparent that seven people was too many to fit in one kitchen. ""@CAPS18 don't @CAPS5 go show them your rooms?"" my @CAPS3 suggested. ""@CAPS19 still haven't met @CAPS20!"" @CAPS21 seemed like a good idea, since @CAPS20, our cat, was friendly to anyone and everyone. @CAPS15 and I led the way to to find him while the @CAPS23 talked in hushed @CAPS6 voices behind us.  As we got to the living room, @PERSON2 @CAPS12 let out a squeal. She ran across the floor to @CAPS20, who had been napping in the sun. I was worried that she would startle him, but the overweight tabby simply got up sleepily and yawned. And then, to our amazement, @CAPS20 did something he'd never done before. He jumped up and placed his hind legs on @PERSON2's chest. He was a large cat, and she was small, so @CAPS4 turned out so that he was looking her in the eye. For a moment, @CAPS19 looked at each other, surprised, and then she fell down into a sitting position. Worried she might cry, I started to go over to help, but then something entirely different escaped out of her mouth: the contagious laugh of a four year old. For a moment, there was a surprised silence from the rest of us as she howled at the hilarity of @CAPS4, but soon we couldn't help but join in. And in that moment, I realized that we didn't even have to learn each other's languages- the laughter that we'd shared had broken the ice and the @CAPS1 barrier.  I still remember that visit fondly today, because @CAPS4's the first time that I realized how alike other cultures are to our own. True, we had a hard time relating at the beginning. But by the end, we had become friends, all because of a cat, a four year old, and the one @CAPS1 we did have in common- laughter."	23	23		46				5	5	5	5	5	4	5	5	5	5	5	4						
21360	8	" One day my brother and I were at the mall looking for a hat to buy. My brother came up to me and asked if he should get it, I told him he shouldn't so then he put it back. Later on we went on our ways to look at a different store, I was at one store while my brother was at another. As I was about to make a purchase I felt a tap on my shoulder and I looked and saw a guy that was working at the last store we were at with two cops with him. I was curious why he was talking to me.  He said to me ""hey where is the hat you stole from my store?"" ""I didn't steal a hat bro"" I answered back. ""@CAPS1 you did, we got it on tape that you had the hat."" said the guy. "" @CAPS2 dude I did not take a hat"" I replied. ""@CAPS3.k. then what about your brother, where is he?"" questioned the guy. I told him where he was and he went there with one of the cops while the other stayed with me while I was making a purchase. At this point I was pretty upset that my brother and I were accused of stealing a hat. The cops started to ask me questions that were personal. I told I wanted to talk to my dad and tell him what is happening. My dad was pretty upset that my brother and I were accused of stealing. My dad was asking me questions of what happened, I told him the truth of what happened. As the cop, my dad and I were walking back to watch the film of the whole incident. We saw my brother walking back with the other cop.  ""I'm good to go, the video shows me putting the hat back on the rack"" said my brother. I was still upset that the guy who worked at the store did not watch the whole film only bits and pieces of it. The guy apologized to my dad and I. I was still mad, because the guy did watch the whole film, and I didn't want the people who saw me with the cop to think I was a troubled kid. As my brother and I look back at this experience we laugh about it and make jokes. There is @CAPS2 reason to be mad about we didn't steal the hat and we knew it. Laughter makes us forget about it. I think without our laughter about it this, could have been different. Laughter makes experiences more fun there is always something to laugh about. It feels like you are take a bunch of weight of your shoulder makes you relived. I could have called the manager about how I felt, and what the guy did with the video, but I just forget about it and crack a few jokes to make myself laugh about it."	18	17		35				4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	3						
21385	8	" All of the memories that I've shared with my friends over the years are marked by the expression of an emotion. Usually they include an abundance of laughter and happiness, just enjoying life and being teenagers. But on the other hand, sometimes these memories are tinged with sadness: day-to-day frustrations, vital playoff games that we've lost by small margins, or the passing of important people in our lives. I think that these highs and lows are remembered most in our minds because they are accompanied by things that are auditory (laughing and crying) and our brains recognize them as being more important than a typical day. As children we're very impressionable, so if something makes us extremely happy or unusually sad, it's going to have an effect on us and be remembered.  I think it's known by everyone that teenagers aren't necessarily the most logical thinkers. Some people speculate that it is genetically programmed into our unborn brains that when we reach our teen years we will make a few silly decisions and possibly get into a small amount of trouble. I'll speak for my generation when I say that our actions aren't always completely thought out and sometimes we simply don't have a reason to explain the strange things that we do. For instance, my friend @PERSON1 has a peculiar and almost obsessive need to keep her car clean at all times. She washes it on multiple occasions throughout the month, and is convinced that driving slower helps to keep the dirt and debris from her mile-long gravel drive away from the candy-apple red paint on her @ORGANIZATION1. This wouldn't bother me, except that every day after school I go to her house along with our other friends, @CAPS1 and @PERSON2, to kill time before practice. The group is always anxious to get away from school because we're tired, hungry, and just want to get to her house and relax, but @PERSON1 never gives in to our persistent begging and is perfectly content to drive at turtle speed. One day, @PERSON2 became fed up and said that she could probably run faster than @PERSON1 was driving. @PERSON1 decided to take her up on the offer, stopped her car, and @PERSON2 proceeded to get out and jog down the driveway alongside the car. Soon she was a good distance ahead of us, dancing and skipping toward our destination. However, she soon changed her mind and since the car was going slow enough, she climbed on the hood and we continued driving, slowly. We were about two hundred feet from @LOCATION1's house, just one small bend before we'd be there, when @PERSON1 realized that if her grandparents, who live right next door, saw us, then she'd be in trouble. She didn't care to enlighten the rest of us with the details of her mental observation and suddenly stopped in the middle of the driveway. @PERSON2 slid off the hood, granted we were only going about eight miles an hour, and momentum pushed her forward at a trot. She slid on the gravel road, landed on her rear, skipped across the ground, and then stopped.  Those of us who had remained in the car were in shock, our mouths agape, and we stared at her for the few seconds she remained sitting. She then stood up, turned to face us, and burst into hysteric laughter. We all let out a collective sigh and burst into hysterics as well, remaining in the same spot for a good five minutes. All of us were near tears and out of breath from laughing about the sight, we laughed randomly together throughout the rest of the day, and told all of our other friends about it.  We had realized that it was a stupid thing to do, and @PERSON2 could have been hurt. But she wasn't, and so we all shared in the camaraderie of the moment. Laughter has that ability to connect people. It takes effort to make someone laugh, to spark the emotional trigger inside them that tells their brain, ""@CAPS2, I'm having fun."" @CAPS3 crying is a sign of extreme sadness, laughter is a sign of joy and elation, an indication of happiness. It shows that you're enjoying what you're doing and want those around you to recognize it. I really enjoy my memories that involve laughter, and when I think of those memories I always laugh again. I think that laughter is one of the rare simple joys in life. You don't have to spend money or drive somewhere, there's virtually no expense. It's timeless, simple, fun."	25	25		50				5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5						
21387	8	" @CAPS10 you laughed today? Many believe that laughing is beneficial in our everyday lives. @CAPS10 you heard the saying ""laughter is the best medicine."" @CAPS1 comes from the idea that having a positive mood will make you feel better. Close to the idea of @CAPS2. Laughing has been said to relieve stress and makes you seem more approachable to someone you @MONTH1 not know yet. The quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" is accurate in my opinion. I relate @CAPS1 to the way my friends and I act and the way I act towards strangers. When meeting someone new making a joke or laughing kind of breaks the ice, and can make the conversation more lighthearted and easy. When I was younger my best friends name was @PERSON1, and we hung out nearly everyday after school. We shared everything we had the same favorite color same hair we even had the same friends. We were girls that everyone though were sister because we hung out so much. We were the kind of friends who could take one look at each other and start laughing thinking about a past memory we had. Like the time we went into the wrong movie or the time we went out to lunch together. I remember going to lunch like @CAPS1 was just the other day though @CAPS1 was easily years ago. One day we went to our daily kindergarten class together just like always except today @PERSON1 was going to get to come home with me and my @CAPS3. My @CAPS3 knew she was going to need to take the car into the shop that day and told us we could tag along and if we were good we would go out to lunch. All day we were on our best behavior because we wanted to go to lunch and then hang out for the rest of the day. @CAPS1 was around lunch time and my @CAPS3 thought, well the car will be a while so I'll take the girls to lunch and then we will pick @CAPS1 up on the way home. So we dropped the car off and headed to @ORGANIZATION1's (a local @CAPS6 restaurant) for a @CAPS7 lunch.  When we got to the restaurant they took our drink orders and I decided @CAPS1 would be a good idea to get a big blackberry slushy type drink. When @CAPS1 came to our table I was really excited and I started to drink @CAPS1 really fast. maybe a little too fast. When all of the sudden ""whoosh"" @CAPS1 had spilled all over my face and clothes, @CAPS1 was everywhere, in my hair, on my face, in my eyes. I was so embarrassed. I was so surprised at how hast the the ice fell on my face that I started crying right in front of my best friend. She was trying so hard not to laugh, she had the biggest smile on her face. When I looked over my @CAPS3 was laughing too I was humiliated. I was so worried my friend and my @CAPS3 would make fun of me being so clumsy, but they both said that @CAPS1 has happened to them too.  After I got cleaned up I realized how silly I had been. I was so embarrassed at the time and at them laughing at me. But when I thought about @CAPS1 I would @CAPS10 laughed too. The whole car ride home we giggled about my little drink disaster and we could hardly look at each other without saying something about my spill, or we would both think about @CAPS1 and start cracking up again.   Even though at first I though she would make fun of me and laugh at me for making such a silly accident, we ended up laughing together and @CAPS1 made us closer as friends. Our memories from when we were little girls last in our minds and we remember they silly and creative things we used to do and the little things that would be fun to us. We were and always will be great friends. We are still best friends and every once in a while one of us will bring something up that makes us think of that day when we were little girls and we will bust out laughing again.  I do believe laughter is the best medicine. Although of course laughter will never conquer or cure diseases or fight off cancers I think @CAPS1 makes you stronger to take the treatment if you are happy and @CAPS10 a positive outlook, if you @CAPS10 something to look forward too, something you don't want to miss. Laughter can make a sick person forget about their illness, @CAPS1 can make them carefree and living in the moment. I think laughter is so much more powerful than we realize. So consider this question instead: @CAPS10 you made someone laugh today?"	18	20	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
21397	8	" When I was in third grade my parents decided that we should move to where my @CAPS1 was born and raised and where my @CAPS2 lived. I, being a determined third grader, was angry and told them that I would not move and even sat on the floor and told them that I was not going. Needless to say I did not get very far, but I was still not happy about being moved from my friends and my @CAPS3's side of the family that I had been around since I was little. My friends were all I had known through my years in elementary school and I was no where near ready to say goodbye to them. It was very hard saying goodbye to them even though we came back and visited later on. We moved three hours away from my hometown. It was a pretty big move, especially for a ten year old who had never really been anywhere else.  Being a new student is never easy. Especially with a shy, quiet personality like mine is and the first day was a scary one. I remember it very vividly. I walked in with my @CAPS4 and my new teacher happened to be in the office at the time, so she took me down to the class and showed me around the school. I was still frightened and was upset that my parents were making me go through this huge change. When class started the teacher made me stand up in front of the class and tell them about myself. I have never been much of a public speaker and it is hard for me to believe that I actually did stand there and talk about myself. I can not even do that very well today, and I am way less shy then I was back then. It was very terrifying to say the least even more so when I was done speaking and the class sat in dead silence. Then I slowly walked to my seat and being the shy person I am, did not talk for the rest of the time until lunch.  At lunch a little girl with freckles and glasses, like myself, came and sat with me. Once she broke down my shy exterior we were laughing, playing and having a real good time. And for the first time that day I thought to myself that moving might turn out to be okay. Me and her became really good friends along with the other girls she hung out with. We sat next to each other in class, talked on the phone, had sleepovers and spent recess together everyday. She was the first best friend I had made when I moved and I was glad it was her and not someone else. Today I am very thankful to her for taking the time to get to know me when I at first was shy and not saying much, because I know how it feels to approach someone you do not know.  The laughter that we shared that first day at lunch and her willingness to break down my walls of shyness really brought us close together. Without her that first day I am unsure how the rest of that day or week would have gone. Without people like her who are willing to make a new friend it would have been a lonely first couple of days for me. Laughter is an important part of a relationship because it brings people closer together and shows that even if you do not know someone very well you still can have a good time. The rest of that day is a better memory because we shared laughter and became friends. It made moving to a new school less scary and helped me to find a place to fit in."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	4	4						
21407	8	"The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I think of laughter I think of my @CAPS2, of all the things that got me rolling on the ground with no breath left in my lungs, enjoying the life that @CAPS4 gave me. We all know that most children find absolutely everything funny. @CAPS3 I was about ten my parents bought my siblings and I a puppy. This was no ordinary puppy, it was the runt of the litter, and it had some kind of mental disorder. Oh, how we loved that puppy. Every day @CAPS3 I got home from school I would go in the back yard and play with the puppy for hours and hours. We finally found a name for @CAPS10 a few days later; his name was @CAPS5. The reason we named @CAPS10 @CAPS5 was because @CAPS9 would literally tip over while just walking.  One day @CAPS3 I got home from school I took @CAPS5 to the top of the hill in our back yard, I was playing with @CAPS10 and running around and laughing. Every time @CAPS5 would run down the hill his little legs would get tangled up and @CAPS9 would nose dive and start tumbling down the hill until @CAPS9 could get back up again, which normally wasn't until @CAPS9 was at the bottom of the hill. @CAPS3 @CAPS9 did that my sister and I would laugh so hard because it was so cute and we just loved it! As children we lived life for the moment, and enjoyed our lives. I think that we still need to do that now. We need laughter and @CAPS1 in our lives, we need to focus on the positive and not dwell on the negative. The laughter of your @CAPS2 should carry on through the rest of your life. @CAPS4 has blessed us with so much, @CAPS9 has given us more than we give @CAPS10 credit for. Laugh for the moment, take @CAPS1 in the small things in life, embrace the amazing creation set before you, and love others like @CAPS4 loves you, because you never know @CAPS3 your time on this earth is over."	19	20	40	40				3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
21422	8	" Laughter in someones life is very important for many different reasons. You can get to know someone by what they think is funny, show emotion and become closer to others by simply laughing together. The memories that are the clearest to anyone or are most personal might have laughter in them. These are also the memories that people would want to remember vividly. I think the quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" is extremely accurate for most. I have many memories of laughter with my friends, family and loved ones around me. I will never forget some stories I have had in life because of all the laughter in them. When I was about six and my brother was about nine we didn't always get along, being the typical brother and sister that we were. We both had very outgoing personalities and had to be doing something at all times. When we did get along we usually had so much fun, ended up rolling around laughing together, and forgetting that we were ever mad at each other. Some of the things we would do would be to play hide and seek inside and outside our house, tag, bored games, and our favorite thing of all was tickle monster. Sometimes our closest friends would play with us but it was usually just something my family did. Most of the time me and my brother would ask my dad to play with us because playing games with two people wasn't very fun at the time. He usually agreed because he enjoyed watching us laugh together and create new memories and stories. When the three of us got together and played games I felt like I was on top of the world and I was really happy at that point in my life. My favorite time that I can think of playing games with them was when we started off by playing hide and seek in our house. Me and my brother usually crammed into little spaces like under the sink, under beds and in closets. We couldn't fit in them for very long because they were very hard to get into even for a little kid. My dad being a lot bigger than us kids would always hide in the shower or behind doors. He was really easy to find but we still found it really fun and laughed every time we found him. One of the times when it was his turn to hide me and my brother went to my room to count to any number we felt like. We were inpatient little kids so we didn't usually count all the way to the number my dad told us to. Then we ran down our stairs, turned the corner, ran down the hall and found him hiding behind the bathroom door. You could always tell if he was there or not because if he was the door wouldn't open all the way. Instead of coming out of hiding when we found him and counting for us while we hid, he started to chase us around the house. We weren't expecting it at all so we were laughing and running and it was hard to breath. Eventually he caught up to us and our game of hide and seek turned into the best game of tickle monster ever! My brother thought we should hide under my parents blanket on their bed but that just made us an easier target for my dad the tickle monster.  By the time he was done tickling us, our faces were red, we were out of breath, tired and had the biggest smiles on our faces from laughing. Trying to breath, trying to get away and laugh all at the same time really tired us out. My dad eventually got us out to the table where we had our lunch and then we all fell asleep with our belly's full and as happy as could be.  That was a really fun memory I have with lots of laughter and good times. To me, laughing is a big part of getting to know someone and strengthening already existing relationships. It puts everyone in a good mood and keeps people happy."	21	20		41				4	4	4	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21424	8	" Laughter is the expression of being happy, being able to be yourself around the people you care about, and expressing your feelings. Anyone can share laughter with anyone, even if someone you dont know very well or someone you have known for a long time and dont talk anymore, make someone else feel good by sharing a laugh with them. Last year my close friend, @LOCATION1 and I were together all the time almost everyday. We always make other laugh at the silliest little things, even if no one else understands what we are talking about. We can make laughter out of any small thing. We hang out a lot so that makes it easier to share our laughter with each other. One day in class we were just sitting in class reading a book and I turn around, there she is sleeping, with drool coming out of her mouth. The room was quiet, I was trying not to laugh really hard I started giggling. I poked her and she woke up and had her hair stuck to the side of her face. It was so funny, I couldnt hold it in anymore. She had a confused look on her face then I pulled out my mirror and showed her what I was laughing at, then she started laughing too. She fixed her hair and wiped the drool away. Then the teacher walked over to us and asked us if we had a problem. We looked at each other and giggled then replied with no we do not have a problem here.  The next day we were walking to the commons after we had come back from @ORGANIZATION1 and we heard one girl say to another girl, ""is that all you do is talk crap about your sister?"" @CAPS1 girl was not a regular girl, she had purple faded dyed hair and teeth that stuck out over her bottom lip, which made the whole thing even more hilarious. @LOCATION1 and I looked at each other and were like holy crap did that really just happen right there? We started laughing after we were out of ear shot so she could not hear us laughing at her. We laughed about that for the rest of the year. Everytime we saw her after that we called her ""girl with purple hair"", because no other girl at our school at the time had purple hair so it was really easy to spot her out of a crowd. Still to @CAPS1 day laugh every once in a while about that situation.   A few weeks later after @CAPS1 had happened we had seen her former boyfriend hanging out with a group of girls so we went closer to see who they were, I did not know any of them, but I saw a couple of them and knew that they were freshman. @LOCATION1 gives them a dirty look and says he definately down graded since I dated him. There was one certain girl that was literally hanging all over him. She was not even pretty at all. She had a short hair cut, but her hair was all greasy, it was like she had put lots of gel or had not taken a shower in two days. The girl was wearing clothes that were obviously way too small for her, you could see half of her upper body just exposed there. It was really trashy. We started laughing really hard because it was so obvious she was trying to get his attention and he was totally ignoring her. @LOCATION1 looked at me and we both starting laughing. I am not really sure what she was laughing at, because I was laughing at the girl hanging all over @LOCATION1's former boyfriend.   The next day we were in @CAPS2 @CAPS3 class and I made a comment about someone was being stupid and a student in the classroom tried to get me in trouble fo rit, but luckily my teacher liked me a lot better than the other student, because that person got in trouble way more frequently than I have. Later on in the day I got called down to the office because the vice principal needed to speak to me. He said @CAPS1 student has a problem with me calling him stupid. I have had lots of issues with @CAPS1 person and I told the vice principal that he is very obnxious, and I also explained everything else that happened earlier. The vice principal told me that I am not in trouble because he was trying to start an issue. We laughed because he tried to get me in trouble and it did not work, then we both laughed because that student is a trouble maker.  I have learned that throughout life you need to have a good laugh every now and then because laughter expresses your feelings and sometimes it just makes you feel really good. I know that with my experience I need to have those close people to make me laugh, also to get me through anything that I am going through."	20	18	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	4	4	4	3	4	3
21426	8	" When I was adopted, I didn't know what to expect. Thoughts ran through my mind of what the @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 were like, what the home was like, and if they would like me or not. I was told I was going to have two new sisters named @PERSON2 and @CAPS3. Sitting in the passenger seat of the black @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS4 my heart began to pound harder and harder at the passing of every street, coming closer each second to the home that I would soon be able to call my own. Approaching the driveway I saw a well laid out, one story blue house. The door was opened by a really tall well built man, who appeared to just have gotten off of work. He was very welcoming and said his name was @CAPS5, as he invited me in I was greeted by a white pit bull whose name was @CAPS6. To the right was a girl with short hair who was a little bit taller than little five foot three inch me, whose name was @CAPS3. I was a year older than her though, so I saw it as a fun thing to have a little sister. At first I didn't notice she was observing me and then finally when I did notice, she gave me a really big smile exposing her beautiful straight teeth. When I met @CAPS1 who said her name was @PERSON1, I automatically felt this warm feeling of acceptance right away. She was also a little bit taller than me, and was very pretty. They told me that I would be meeting @PERSON2, my older sister the following @DATE1 because she was attending college in @LOCATION1 at @ORGANIZATION1. We stood in the kitchen and talked a little bit trying to get to know the basics about each other. I became very talkative as little electric currents of anxiety drifted through my body. We talked about our interests for a while, and then I finally asked them what the rules were. The response I got was quite different than what I thought I was going to get. I learned that they have never had to ground any of the girls, the only thing that I should make sure to do is simply respect everyone in the household. Finally @CAPS2 decided it was time for the grand tour of the home. My room was a bed room that at the moment was being used as a storage room, so I had to stay with @CAPS3 in her room for a few weeks until @CAPS2 could get all of the things taken out into a shed he was going to built outside in the back yard. The continuous rain kept him from being able to do anything outside, so instead he built a desk for the computer that would fit in the bay window next to the kitchen. Since plan A didn't work out for my room, @CAPS1 ended up having the office be converted into my room and the bay window area was converted into an office space for @CAPS2 to be able to run his business. Each week that passed I began to feel more comfortable, my favorite part of the day was dinner because @CAPS1 was a really great cook. @CAPS1 would take me to counseling sessions to make the transition into the family an easy one. I have never had any one put my needs first before, and it made me feel loved for once in my life. It was always really easy to talk to @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, but I would always find it a little bit harder to talk to @CAPS3. I was always worrying about saying too much or not saying enough, even not being able to say the right thing at the right time. Trying to connect with my sister was a challenge for me. I wanted to get to know what her interests were, but she would constantly be with her friends or be doing her homework.  It wasn't until my @ORGANIZATION1 was having a @CAPS18 @CAPS19 fundraiser that we decided to go. She invited her friend @PERSON3 and I went along to pay for their ice cream. When we arrived and got our ice creams we all sat down at a table when all of a sudden, @ORGANIZATION2's @ORGANIZATION1 friends show up and decide to leave @CAPS3. I see the hurt in @CAPS3's stare right away, so I began to tell her a funny story of something that had happened to me. After I was done we laughed and then she replied with a story of her own. We kept talking back and forth in a reciprocal conversation, and without realizing it we were really enjoying ourselves. It wasn't until later that week when I went to see the counselor that I learned laughter brings people together and connects them in ways one cannot imagine. To this day @CAPS3 and I are really close, and we even prank each other now. I love my little sister @CAPS3."	21	20		41				5	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21428	8	"     In order to to laugh you have to be happy. I was once happy until I made mistakes. The mistakes I've made me more dissapointed in myself than anything else I could think of. I sit in a room that I don't want to because of my actions. My life was perfect before I had my brothers my parents and my love of my life. Now I look back on how nothing is worth taking me away from them. The laughs I'm missing out on right now is what hurts most, because I could be at home or even at school right now. Instead I'm here without my laughs, my brothers, my parents, and my love. Trying to put a smile on my face even though I know I'm happy. My life was one of the best lives you could have asked for, but because of my actions I ruined it. Every moment I got to have with my beautiful babygirl, in other words my love. I cherished the time I had with her and now i have to wait to have a laugh with her. I get about fourty five minutes to and hour and a half every day to talk to her and my family and it deffinently hurts more then what you could imagine. having to talk on the phone that you can barely hear their threw it just kills me. Knowing that everything I've done has effected me and my family. Alot effects my brothers though and I know they don't understand but hopefully one day they will. hearing my little brother @CAPS1 over the phone crying because he can't see me. It just hurts inside even writing about this right now makes me want to just break down in tears. I almost fell like could in front of these other kids that are in here too. My family is my main priority and when i get out I gonna make sure to get back on track for my family. So I can have the laughs that I want now.   In the @DATE1 I would have never guessed that I'd be here where I'm at now but when I get home I'm gonna put a smile on my brothers face and my parents and when I see my girl I'm gonna go give her the biggest smoochie boo kiss of her life so she'll cry and laugh."	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3						
21431	8	" Laughter plays an important role in everyone's lives. Different laughs represent various things. For instance, have @CAPS2 ever heard someone chuckle and know right away that they are being sarcastic, or maybe even sympathetic? A laugh can say a lot. I'm going to tell @CAPS2 about the time my friend fell into an @NUM1 pond.  In early @DATE1, my friend was visiting me at my house for a week. The third morning of her stay, we woke up and it had snowed seven inches @TIME1. I was used to the soft, white flakes spiraling through the air, @CAPS1 @CAPS1 was from @LOCATION1 and had never seen snow before. As my friend was listing all of the things @CAPS1 wanted to do that day, @CAPS1 let out the most anxious laugh I had ever heard. I could tell @CAPS1 just wanted to go outside that very moment. Of course @CAPS1 knew it was going to be cold but I didn't think @CAPS1 knew how cold. I told her it was going to be chillier than what @CAPS1 might be expecting.  We got dressed in numerous layers of clothing: socks, pants, shirts, and jackets so we could head out. As we were walking down the snowy hill @CAPS1 spotted the @NUM1 pond on the lower half of my property and hurled towards it. @CAPS1 asked if we could go swimming, I laughed a sarcastic laugh and answered, ""heck no!"" @CAPS1 walked toward a massive log that lays across the water and decided to cross it. @CAPS1 said that if I didn't go with her @CAPS1 would push me in. So I took a step back, @CAPS1 just looked down and continued walking. As @CAPS1 stepped onto the log that was glazed with ice @CAPS1 got a little cocky and decided to jump around to show me it was ""fun."" I laughed at the funny movements @CAPS1 was making and whispered, ""@CAPS2're going to fall."" All of a sudden @CAPS1 slipped and the ice cracked. It reminded me of glass shattering on a cement floor. This picture in front of me was almost as if it was in slow motion; I can remember her hands reaching up to grasp the log before @CAPS1 fell in to the freezing water. @CAPS1 fell through, I bounded @TIME1 to help her out, I slowly pulled her out of the pond. I looked at her after I had harpooned onto the log and we both burst out in laughter...although her teeth were chattering and her multiple layers of clothing we soaked, I knew @CAPS1 was @CAPS3 going to cherish this moment because it was her first snow experience.  Walking up to the house @CAPS1 giggled, ""I should have listened to @CAPS2 huh?"" I nodded my head and suggested we take off her clothes to ring out and put in the dryer.We changed into pajamas and sipped on hot chocolate and coffee all day long, sharing laughter and smiles. I will @CAPS3 remember this day because there were so many different stories I can tell from it."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21432	8	" Laughter forms a bond between two people; a good laugh can turn an uncomfortable situation into a pleasant one. A fantastic example of the power of laughter would be the first time I met my mother's boyfriend. My father died when I was thirteen and since then I had stubbornly resented each new man my mother attempted to bring into my life. This iron clad resolution ended when my two sisters and myself sat down to dinner with @ORGANIZATION1. One @DATE1 @TIME1, my mother announced that she had invited her new boyfriend over meet her children. My sisters and I were forced to scrub the house from top to bottom in order to prepare for our guest, while my mother cooked a giant pan of lasagna. When the house was clean and the dinner was cooked, I dressed for this most grievous occasion. My obsessive compulsive mother made me change clothes at least thirty times before she deemed me presentable enough to meet the man whose existence I was beginning to despise. At precisely six thirty in the @TIME2, @PERSON1's blue @ORGANIZATION2 pulled into our driveway. I shot my mother a steely eyed glare as I opened the door for the buffoon; thus, a most dreaded dinner began.  My determined hatred began to soften as soon as I saw @PERSON1, but it was by no means expired. @PERSON1 was tall and tan, a few years older than my mother judging by his wrinkle strewn skin and the silver streaked through his dark hair and matching mustache. He had the sort friendly, pleasant appearance that makes him immediately likable. My now giddy mother and her sullen children sat down to eat with the cheerful stranger. My younger sister warmed up to him first. She and @PERSON1 share a love of snakes, lizards and all things I deem ""creepy crawly."" A common interest brought them together before I knew it. My older sister adored @PERSON1 after a lively conversation about football ensued. @PERSON1 and my sister discovered they were both @CAPS1 fans, and consequently formed a bond over their team.  After winning my siblings over, @PERSON1 tried to charm me into liking him to. He attempted to talk of movies, music, sports, animals, even politics, but nut nothing he said could melt my icy disposition. I was determined to hate him from the start of the @TIME2, and no amount of charisma would break my persistent stubbornness. Eventually he gave up on me, and focused on entertaining the people who did like him. Over dessert he jumped into a stand-up comedy routine cleverly disguised as a story about his recent flight to @LOCATION1. He went on about the ridiculous security checks, the overly cheerful flight attendants who really hate their job, and the corny safety videos. I had tears of laughter in my eyes before I remembered that I had made a solemn vow to loath @PERSON1. I fought hard to resume my former demeanor, but my will did not stand a chance against @ORGANIZATION1's sense of humor. The triumphant smile and slick wink he shot me from across the table told me that he had won. Sure enough, we were the best of friends before the night ended.   Eventually @PERSON1 and I conversed about movies and music and found we had similar tastes in both, but our common interests had nothing to do with our friendship. They simply fueled the fire. The power of laughter brought us together like a magnet and a washer. Just as the shortest distance between to points is a straight line, laughter was the straight line between myself and @PERSON1. He and my mother are still together, and ever since he came into our lives, laughter has been our constant companion."	27	20	50	50				6	5	6	6	6	5	4	4	5	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5
21436	8	" We all know the benefits of laughter. Many people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Is there anything more to laughter? Can one person be happy without laughing? I have never gone a day without laughing. I know the benefits of laughter. Do you? I know the benefits of laughter. Its truly amazing how something so simple can bring people together, make friends and fix relationships, or make someones day a little better if they are having a rough time. There was a time in ninth grade when my best friend and I got into an argument because I didn't ask him to be on our basketball team for a tournament that happened once a year. After talking it out, and my best friend cracking a few jokes, it had fixed everything. My point is that laughing can release tension, not make everything so serious. Laughing can help you make friends too. Around the world, simple laughter can bring two or more people together. What about enemies? Laughter could possibly show you something you like in that person your not too fond of. Laughter happens to be great for health too, and its a proven fact. What happens when you are really stressed about a test you had recently taken or something different? There are a lot of ways to handle stress, but a really good technique is simply laughter. Try going onto the internet to find something funny that will make you laugh, go hangout with a friend or group of friends, or go and find something else that might have you laugh a little. A famous @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 always gets nervous before one of his shows, and it just so happens that laughter is something he uses to shake off his butterflies. Its quite amazing how laughter can help you in many situations.  Do you ever find yourself feeling down or stressed? Have you had a good laugh recently? Laughing will probably help. If you are having trouble bonding with a friend or simply having a bad day laughter will be a great cure. Laughter is great for your health, and laughter has helped me in my life so far. and whether you realize it or not laughter helps you to. Your laughter can help others too! Next time you feel down or need something to lift your spirits have some fun with friends or do something you enjoy that might give you a good laugh."	18	19		37				3	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	4	3	4	4						
21446	8	" Once, a very long time ago I laughed very hard with a friend is when some kid hit the floor falling and started to cry.There was water on the ground and he was soaked. The janitor was wiping the floor with water. the kid was not payingany attention at all to the janitor. The janitor was also a mean person, he was mad at the boy for stealing stuff from the school janitor's closet. The boy was also mad because the janitor was mean to him I was in @NUM1 grade and I didn't know any better. I had to say that I was sorry because the teacher caught meand my friend laughing,and told me the boy was not mentally well or stable. I felt bad, and apologized right away. I told the kid that I didn't mean anything by it, that it was just a reaction.The boy was able to laugh at himself and he and I became friends. I feel that this small event in my life changes me for the better. I am not so quick to laugh at others misfortunes @CAPS1, people are stupid all over the world, no one is perfect. Everyone is different and unique in the own way. The world never be as one, their will always be war all the time forever on earth."	16	14		30				3	3	4	4	4	3	3	2	3	3	3	3						
21449	8	"One day my friend and I were waking up late in the day and his brother came in screaming and yelling at the top of his lungs ""bro bro""! This was the nickname he called him because he was only two years old, so my friend spencer calmed him down and we started watching t.v. We were talking about what we were going to do for the day so, we started throwing out ideas till we made one where we were going to swim later and play some games now. Spencers mom asked us when we were going to swim and that we had to take his little borther. So we went early so his little bro could swim and we could sit around and listen to music. Unlike everyone who uses an ipod I use my phone because then I can text and listen to music plus when someone calls it shuts off music so I'll know. It was a brand new phone too and i was loving every moment of having it. So when we dropped his little brother off we went back too the pool and sat in the hot tub for a while. I put my phone on my shirt and my towl over both so when spencer got out too use the towl he jerked the towl out and my phone flew up hit the ground slid on the floor all the way too the hot tub. That moment I look down and see it and freak I took it out ripped the back off and dried the battery with the towl hoping it would still work and it wouldn't stop dialing zero and nine so I took the battery out again. When we got back to his moms i plugged in the charger with no battery and spencer kept saying sorry and I kept answering ""its ok"". The next morning his mom asked why we didn't use a pot of rice and we started laughing because we freaked out so bad over a phone. I forgot all about the phone after that just kept laughing and the phone worked it is one of the funniest stories. "	16	16		32				3	3	4	4	4	3	4	3	4	4	3	3						
21452	8	" I believe laughter is an important part of any relationship. In all my relationships whether it be friends,family,or a girlfriend laughter is always an important element of all of them.  the best relationship i have is with my best friend @PERSON1 and it is filled with laughter. We always have a great time together, like last @DATE1 when she and I went to snow peak with some friends and I tore ligaments in my knee when I jumped @PERSON2's quad. We laughed about me being stupid and getting hurt for it and we laughed about @CAPS1 big ears and how they make him look like @CAPS2 the elephant.  I think what makes us so close and such good friends is how much we make each other laugh. The first time we met she was dating one of my friends and the first thing I did was make her laugh and ever since then we have been awesome friends. Then she asked me if I wanted to work at the harvest fest, with her and I did and a made her laugh the whole time. Now I'm her dork and she is my best friend. The biggest thing I did to make her laugh at the harvest fest, was when I did a wheelie in the tractor down the whole track with a cowboy hat on and a huge dip of @LOCATION1 in my lip.  The moral of this story is the more you make people laugh the stronger and closer the relationships you will have whether it be with friends,family,or a significant other."	17	16		33				3	4	3	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	3	3						
21453	8	"            Just One @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 A @CAPS4 @CAPS5 the @DATE1 of us, @PERSON2, @LOCATION1 and I, walk under the cover of the trees, we decided to stop by the lake, in our usual meeting place where we have a perfect view, to have a chat. @LOCATION1, who is six foot @DATE1, has long raven-black hair that just barely tickles his chin, deep blue eyes, and is extremely attractive, plopped down in the wet green grass. But @PERSON2, who is six foot, has short brown hair, dark ocher colored eyes, chose to stand about @DATE1 paces in front of us.  To any person strolling by, he would have looked @CAPS5 if he was just enjoying the amazing view of the crystal water, but to us, who knew him all too well, knew he was thinking about his brother, @PERSON1, who was in the hospital. @PERSON1 had been in the wrong place at the wrong time, got in the middle of a homeless persons fight, not to mention the guy was drunk, and got stabbed with a rusty switch-blade. @PERSON2 felt like it was his fault that this had happened, and this made him so depressed that he would not @CAPS1 at any of our idiocy, or even eat for that matter. @PERSON2's feeling that way made @LOCATION1 and I feel completely horrible and there was nothing we could do to cheer him up. @PERSON2 was usually the most exuberant out of all of us, and we did every single thing we could possibly so to make him feel better, or, at the very least, get him to @CAPS1 again. But not once could we budge him, or even get one little giggle out of his tightened jaw. Not one of our pathetic attempts even touched his eyes, but we never gave up, in fact, we tried for days on end to get him to smile again. We got to the point of desperation that we even dressed ourselves up @CAPS5 teletubies, went to @PERSON2's house, dragged him off of his couch, and took him downtown. Yet not one second of it did his mouth even twitch upwards.  Although we did some of the most outrageous, unimaginably embarrassing things we could possibly think of, and trust me, we though about it for days. We got absolutely no response what so ever out of him, except, of course, his enormous yawns.  Finally, about @DATE1, we got him to giggle, which eventually turned into a full on, body shaking @CAPS1. You will never guess what finally got him to crack. @CAPS6-@CAPS6 joke. Of all the horrendously obnoxious deeds we had done, cheesy, idiotic @CAPS6-@CAPS6 jokes are what got to him. Although @LOCATION1 and I felt like complete idiots, we could not help but @CAPS1 with him. After that day it was no longer a difficult process for him. @PERSON2 was almost, but not quite, back to his normal self. So our lives went on, and @PERSON1 got out of the hospital perfectly fine."	18	20	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3
21454	8	" Sometime life is complicated. Nothing is ever black and white. This is a short glance of my childhood. I think the best placed to start is the beginning.  When I was about @NUM1 years of age I had my first memory. My dad, @PERSON3, my brothers and I were all at a pond over in @LOCATION1. We were racing @CAPS1 boats that my dad had build. We would go there every other @DATE1 after school, from the moment I get out of school till it is so dark outside you can'@CAPS4 see you hand right in front of your face. One particular time I remember going, was the time my brother decided I need to go for a swim. My brothers and I got along but were never really close to one another. @CAPS9 loved pulling pranks on me, being that I was the youngest. So I was standing next to my dad and brother, there was a whole bunch of small ferns around us. My brother @PERSON2 jumped out of one of the bushes behind me and it made me jump. Meanwhile my brother @PERSON1 was on his hands and knees waiting for be to jump so he can make me trip over him. Well I did, there was a drop off at the edge of the pond that no one really noticed and I went tumbling down the hill. My elbow ran into stomach and my head hit a rock, then a @CAPS2! I was now soaked laying there a gooey green monster. At the moment no one was laughing but later on we did. The rest of that night no one really talked. The sun was just starting to set and I was sitting on the tail of a truck covered with blankets as my dad, brothers and @PERSON3 stood in the setting sun. I will never forget that loomenesint sight. As years pasted things gradually got worse between my brothers and myself. Things weren'@CAPS4 quit as easy. There wasn'@CAPS4 a forgive and forget. My brother @PERSON2 is five years older than me. He has @CAPS3 and serious relationship problems. One day he decided he was going to take out his problems on me. I was about @NUM2 years old. I loved my brothers and I didn'@CAPS4 know his ulterior motive at the time. My whole family except my dad was watching @CAPS4.V. in the living room. My brother @PERSON2 went back to his room and put spider man into his mini @CAPS5 player and climbed up the ladder into his bed. It was a titanium bed with a desk on the bottom, the top bunk was nearly kissing the sealing. He came out of his room and went into the kitchen and filled up his water bottle. As he filled his bottle up he asked if anyone wanted to watch spider man. Being my mother was watching the news I took him up on his offer. We both climbed up into the top bunk and watched the movie. We watched it for a little. I was cold so he offered me a blankets I got him last @CAPS6. It was fuzzy thick and warm with a huge tiger on it. Like most boys he slept in boxers and that was kinda weird seeing him walk around in them. But I never said anything. As we laid there he stuck his hand into my pants. I pushed him away and continued to watch the movie. He tried it several more times but I wouldn'@CAPS4 let him. I didn'@CAPS4 think it was right. But then he pinned my down with his leg across mine. I didn'@CAPS4 scream. He started to wiggle his finger around in my pants, it stung. I told him deliberately to stop, he didn'@CAPS4. Then he grabbed a pencil from behind him and stuck it in my vagina. Seconds later my dad walked in and said it was bed time. My brother threw himself back and I went soaring out of his room. That night was the first time my dad didn'@CAPS4 read me a bedtime story.  A few months later my brother @PERSON1 started acting weird too. He was always jittery around me and was never relaxed. One day he went out and bought a whole bunch of my favorite candy. Those @CAPS7 ""@CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1's."" @CAPS9 look like a @ORGANIZATION1 that was white and crunchy on the outside and the inside is full of chocolate. He would bribe me with these, saying, ""I will give you one box of @CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1's if you let me touch you in three places of my choice."" I didn'@CAPS4 know it was wrong. I just wanted the candy, so I let him. This interaction went on for about a year. He never did anything to invasive. After all this stuff happened I really didn'@CAPS4 know what to do with myself. Once I knew it was wrong I cried but that didn'@CAPS4 help. So I tried laughing and it worked. Knowing that laughter is a key part in forgetting things, helped me move on."	21	21	42	42				5	4	5	4	4	4	5	4	5	4	4	4	5	4	5	4	4	4
21463	8	"@NUM1)I heard one true story about one normal @CAPS1 businessman. he wasn't that high levelin his company. @CAPS2 he always say hello to everyone in company with his big laugh.One day, the boss of company came to his company and asked everyone " who doingwork hardest?" @CAPS2 nobody didn't answer that question. then the boss said "or recommendsomeone for promote level" and then everyone recommended that business man. Becausehe always say hello to everyone with big laugh. and he goes to highest level in his company except the boss. what I'm trying to say is the laugh make people happier. and when i was with my friends,laugh was make us more friendly. also laugh is good for health too. If you laugh a lotyour life is getting way more longer than before. of course it is good for mind too.that business man wasn't very good worker. He just made everyone happier to his laugh.that's why he could be a highest level of the company.I think laugh is really good for everything. and I also laugh a lot.

21478	8	" I always wished that I could go back in time and relive @CAPS7 childhood. Knowing that that was the time when I was most happiest and the time I was just living life with no purpose, no plans. Looking down on @CAPS7 little cousins or brother, I see joy, and laughter, and silliness. I see innocent soft faces who have no idea nor understanding for what is going on around them. As I watch them slowly grow out of their unusual habits, I find myself back @CAPS4 the year @DATE1. A little girl, not in school yet, runs in her grandmother's yard on a @DATE4's mid day. She flops her pig tails back and forth while hiding her hands in her size @NUM1 trousers with one eye closed and the other slightly opened watching her older sister run around looking for a place @CAPS4 hide.  ""@CAPS1, nine, eight, seven..."" ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6!"" @CAPS7 sister, @PERSON1, yells out @CAPS4 me from behind one of the giant oak trees.I giggle @CAPS4 myself a little and start at @CAPS8. ""@CAPS8, four.. three.. two.."" I slow down dramatically, ""ONE!"" and like a rocket, I blast off the front porch with @CAPS7 arms spread out on each side, making engine noises, and pretended I was a pilot ""@CAPS9 on lock! Mayday, mayday! CRASH!"". I tackle @CAPS7 sister @CAPS4 the ground. I remember the look on our mothers face as we lay there rolling around in the grass laughing. I closed @CAPS7 eyes and reopened them @CAPS4 find myself in @DATE2. It was a few days after the tragic happening of @NUM2. Everyone met at grandma's house as always, kids in one room and adults in the other. I was playing in our small ball pit with the two youngest cousins, @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION1, when we noticed that there was a small hole in the wall. ""@CAPS6, look through."" @PERSON2 demanded.I took a deep breath and did what he asked.  ""@CAPS11!"" I yelled The little hole gave us a vision of what was happening in the room next @CAPS4 us which held all the parents and old people with straight looks and serious tones. I let the little ones have a look, they didn't find it as interesting as I did but they wouldn't give me another chance @CAPS4 see. I pushed @CAPS7 way through. All three of us looking through something so small. We kept giggling, and talking. We did this for about @CAPS1 minutes, not knowing that our uncle was watching us for at least @CAPS8 minutes. He motioned the other adults @CAPS4 see what we were doing. One by one, noticing that the amount of people in the next room was decreasing. Soon, there wasn't any of them in sight. ""@CAPS12 did they all go?"" We panicked.Light, quite laughing was going on behind us. @PERSON2 looked toward @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 looked at me, I looked down @CAPS4 @PERSON2, and at the same time we turned around and saw everyone smiling, laughing, and taking pictures of us. We stood still with red faces and soon started pointing fingers about who gave us the crazy idea of spying.  After that, it was like any day with family; everyone in the living room, food in the kitchen, warm hugs and kisses from grandma, people pinching @CAPS2 cheeks, big smiles and long loud laughs. I see friends shaking hands and kids yelling and screaming, people telling they're loved ones ""I love you"". I look down at @CAPS7 feet and with a blink of an eye, I'm back @CAPS4 @DATE3. I raise @CAPS7 head up over @CAPS7 shoulders, see that I'm in grandmas living room babysitting the kids. I'm sixteen this year, and I don't believe that there is one day when I don't laugh. Of course I can't laugh when it comes @CAPS4 all seriousness , but other than that, laughing is part of humor/youth. When someone tells a joke and you think it was funny you don't just stand there and say that was funny and not laugh. Everyone knows that, once in a while, they have @CAPS4 take a step back and laugh. I always wished that I could go back in time and relive @CAPS7 childhood. Knowing that that was the time when I was most happiest and the time I was just living life with no purpose, no plans. I had no desire @CAPS4 impress anybody. I lived @CAPS7 childhood well and when I think about it, I just sit back, look at everything that I have done, and laugh.  "	20	27	42	42				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	6	5	5	6	5	4	4	5	5	5	4
21480	8	"  Laughter in life is a good thing to have I believe. Once @CAPS3 I was @NUM1 year's old I had a and @CAPS1. We always loved to hang out and do things together like take walks, or go to the beach, or go to the parks. What was so funny was that that we also loved to eat together too, maybe not out his dog bowl, but off of plates or on a picnic table. He was a cute dog. He had four little puppies named @CAPS5-@CAPS6, popcorn,big tail, and mountain. I named them all weird animal names because that's either what they smelled like or that's what they looked or loved doing.  Why we named my dog @CAPS1 was because he always smelt like @CAPS1. I always took him on walks to make him a healthy dog. It made me very angry @CAPS3 he had puppies and a mate. I don't know why maybe just because head I really loved my dog and i wanted him to be mine only. My favorite friend. I thought in my head hey! that's my dog and you leave him alone and do not touch him. Well @CAPS3 he had puppies i finally realized in my head @CAPS1 just wanted a life of his own too, a family, and be a big boy dog. He didn't hate me, he loved me and giving him a family is what I allowed and it made him happy. What was funny about the little puppies was that they smelt like odd food, like @CAPS1, @CAPS5 chops, or popcorn. My favorite puppy was @CAPS5 @CAPS6 because that's what he smelt like, not @CAPS1 but @CAPS5. POPCORN was a good dog too so was the other dogs but @CAPS5 @CAPS6 was a biter. It's funny because those little puppies love to bite and chew on stuff. The second you leave my puppies alone they will so eat everything. One time @CAPS3 we went on a trip to another state he had to leave the puppies alone with a babysitter, and @CAPS3 we came back they ate up a lot of the clothes and destroyed everything. I also had @CAPS11 too but they weren't good animals or pets to have they also ate everything up, and they stink. No not like @CAPS1 or popcorn but something else gross. The puppies loved to nibble on your toes and your hair. They had small teeth but oh they hurt. Stinky breath those dogs had I don't know why but there stinky. One of my favorite story about @CAPS1 was that he never liked to swim. It was odd to me because you would have thought cats hate water more than dogs. Well @CAPS1 did not know how to swim so I had to teach him myself as a good owner and all. Well @CAPS3 ever he doggy-paddled, he stuck his head underwater and swam forward. I don't know why, but I always thought can he breath like that? or is it just a doggy thing. Well eventually I got him over that, I don't think it was good for him to swim underwater. Like cats he used to never like water, it was just a phobia my dog had I guess. But I tried my best to get him over it. @CAPS3 I moved around states I had to leave him it was the saddest thing in my life ever. But we all move on right. Laughter I think is so good to have in your life because it can help you become more anti-depressed and not have to focus on the bad things in life. Every now and then @CAPS3 I am sad i just go and think of @CAPS1. I had other animals like @CAPS10, @CAPS11, @CAPS12, and cats. Personally I love cats more than dogs but @CAPS1 will always be the first. My cats weren't really that social to me, there lazy.What was so funny about my cats was that I named one of them @CAPS14. Why I named that cat @CAPS14 was because he was all black but with white feet. It was funny because @CAPS3 ever he got mad he did a lot of turning and jumping around. He was a wild kitty. I named one of my cats @CAPS15 because he was so fast at everything. What was funny about him was @CAPS3 ever you play around with him he charged off like he ate a bowl of cat nip. Having animals in my life to be with gave me a story of laughter in my life, and happiness. Laughter I think is a good important part of relationships too. If you do not laugh in your relationship then I believe that the couple are not so happy. Laughter can be good many time's, but also can be a insult too. If it means becoming a insult to some people or even laughing at people is rude.  Having laughter in your life is something you should always keep because it can help you become happy in many situations and problems you encounter in life. To be happy you should have laughter."	15	17		32				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3						
21485	8	"Freshmen year, @CAPS1 season. I have been @CAPS1 for about eight years now, I made varsity in a @NUM1 school in @LOCATION1 my first year in high school. Being the only freshmen on the varsity squad, everybody knew who I was, ""The short kid on the varsity @CAPS1 squad."" @CAPS2 a eighth grader I won junior state and wrestled all the way through the brackets without @CAPS1 a full match. Meaning that I pinned everyone in the first round. I couldn't be touched. Going into high school I knew that I wouldn't have @CAPS2 easy of a time like in grade school. I was completely right. My coach had to be the funniest person that I have ever met in my life. @PERSON1 was my @CAPS3 teacher since the @NUM2 grade and has been my role model all the way through life. He made the funniest jokes about wrestlers on the team. A lot of people disliked @PERSON1 @CAPS12 @CAPS4 and him got along great. I ended the season freshmen year with @NUM3 wins, @NUM4 pins, and @NUM4 losses. I still to @CAPS13 day haven't been pinned. Which got @CAPS4 the wrestler of the year awarded by my @CAPS1 coach @PERSON4. When the season rolled around to regionals I knew that I had a shot to go to state. There were six guys in my weight class and four of the six I have previously beaten in early season. I had to just worry about my match ahead of @CAPS4 and wrestle mistake free.  At the @NUM6 pound weight class there is a bunch of little kids. I was definitely the most experienced in my weight class. I got seated first seed. The second seed was @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1. He dropped weight so he could try and take my seating for state. My first match I wrestled @CAPS5 from @CAPS6-@CAPS7-@CAPS8. The match was very short-lived. I pinned him in about @NUM4 seconds. After my match with @CAPS5 I walked to my coach and he told @CAPS4 a quote that I will never forget, ""@CAPS10, @CAPS11's lonely at the top, @CAPS12 the view is excellent."" @CAPS13 quote stuck in my head throughout all of my next matches. I won my second and third matches and was in the semi-finals. I was one round away from going to state automatically. I wrestled @CAPS5 from @PERSON3 and he weighed @NUM8 lbs. I knew that he was a good wrestler even though I had about @NUM9 pounds on him. I was getting ready to wrestle and I seen @CAPS5 warming up across the gym from @CAPS4. @CAPS2 he was jumping around getting warmed up I see him trip and fall on his face. My coach had seen the same thing and started making fun of him. @CAPS11 was the funniest thing that I have ever witnessed. I wrestled through the match and pinned him in double overtime to go to state. My coach walks up to @CAPS4 and says ""@CAPS11 took you that long to pin someone who can't even warm up without falling on his face."" @PERSON1 had about three teeth total in his mouth. He lost them from a lot of different ways. He was a adventure man. He loved white water rafting and loved the sport of @CAPS1. When I moved, I was far away from my idolized @CAPS1 coach, @CAPS12 we still hit @CAPS11 up on the facebook and chitchat. To @CAPS13 day, he is still the funniest man I know and still my idol."	20	16		36				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	3	3						
21488	8	" When I was a young boy I used to laugh at anything I could, but as a kid who didn't? As I got older and grew more, I developed a great sense of humor that to my advantage made me a young people pleas-er. I grew more and more developing a stronger, more confident sense of humor. I could always remember making people laugh and loving the attention I received from humor.  As my body grew older and my humor grew more funny I had made myself more dependent on my people pleasing personality. In addition, I then taught myself how to alter my voice and change my tone for a more humorous effect. It was a step I knew was appropriate to advance my humorous personality. I had no intention of loosing my humor, so I used it to my advantage.  I used my humor to boost my @CAPS1 count, to get attention from non-accepting peers, and to get the attention that I thrived on. I had began to be accepted by higher peer groups that used to look down on me and it seemed as if I had a lot of the attention. Anything I could do to make my fellow peers laugh was a goal for me. Anything from rolling down stairs, telling jokes, making teachers angry which students thought was funny, and occasionally destroying things. All this just so I could fit into the crowd that used to reject me. As I advanced into high school I knew my humor needed work to keep my peers still laughing, I just didn't know what kind of work I needed. That was when I started to ultimately loose my funny, humorous personality. I had then dropped in the peer ranks, down to the kids I thought were once called strange. I was friends with people who didn't always keep their heads up and were constantly down and seemed never positive. I was letting people that I called friends drag me to the bottom when I knew I should be more at the top. This was my first major downfall in which I had successfully lost my humorous personality. One of my friends especially brought me down more than anyone else, down to a father level of being unhappy. That so called ""@CAPS1"" took me down so far that I needed therapy to help me get back up to a normal level of happiness. I finally realized that it wasn't fun to be someones @CAPS1 who only drags you down. I finally broke free of that clutch when she moved, I wasn't mean enough to say I didn't wanna be friends with her, it was just to hard for me. When she moved it allowed me to heal myself and pay more attention to my humor. I had broke my dark days away and started back on my endless trail of humor. It was hard to accept the fact that I had lost my humor for what seemed to be forever, and lost my spot in the social bracket which would be hard to regain. But after a month of hard work and focus on both school and humor I had got my personality back to normal! Instantly after I regained my humor I began to feel more happy. I received more attention and felt like I was back to were I should be, although I was just a little lower. Back in the saddle of humor, back the laughs of my peers, back to the smiles, and most importantly back to the way I used to be. I had to regain all of my humor and personality, my tones, voices, and jokes but it was worth it, in a strange way. As I now continue my humor as a junior and I have not successfully lost it yet, but there is always a future. I managed to turn the best thing I had to the worst I have felt in a matter of weeks, then right back up again. In the end its not what you have that matters it is what you can do to please yourself and in the end I would not change a thing!"	21	20		41				5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4

21490	8	"  Laughter saved my life. Growing up, my life was pretty normal. Me, my little brother, mom, and dad, all living happily together in a nice suburban area. But two years ago, everything changed; and it seemed as though it wasn't for the better. My parents got a divorce. It was all very strange because at that time in my life I thought that that couldn't happen to me; it was impossible. As I talked to my friends and family about it, I learned to live with the fact that my family would never be the same again. But thought I came to grips with my new life, I still was unhappy a lot of the time. But the times when I was with my best friends and caring family, were the times that I forgot about all of the things going on at home.  George and I have been really close friends since the @NUM1 grade. We are inseparable. Though I have many other friends, he is the one I would always turn to if there's a problem. He knows me better than anybody else. We talk every day at school, we text message each other every night, and hang out almost every weekend. The night that my parents told me they were getting a divorce I called him crying. He told me that in the end it would all be okay, and he told me that he was always there for me if I needed anything. At that point in time it was clear to me that I had something that not a lot of people can say they had in their lifetime: A true friend who would be there through anything with me. He and I would joke about all my problems. To some, that @MONTH1 seem a little strange; but it was almost therapeutic to me. Making fun of my life, made it easier to live it in a sense. It helped me to realize that I need to let go of the past, and that just because there's a rough patch, doesn't mean that the rest of my life is destined to be this way. George knew how to cheer me up, and he could always tell when I needed a good talk, or a good laugh to make my day better.  A girl always needs another girl in her life to tell secrets, to do crazy things, and to lay on the couch all day watching sappy love movies with. For me, its @CAPS1. When we're together there is no stopping us. She was always right by my side through my parents divorce. She was there with me, my last night in my house before we moved out. We sat on my bed in my empty room, recalling all the memories the house had given us. Some would think this would be a sad time, but all we did was laugh. Because all of the memories were good ones.We weren't crying because we were upset; we were crying from laughing about all of our insane adventures for hours. To me, that's a pretty good reason to cry.We re-lived our best moments that night, and we weren't going to let the situation make us upset. We wanted to make our last memory in my house a good one; that we would always remember.  My family is quite strange; but we do know how to have a good time. I don't have many family members, but I think that because we are so tightly knit, we get along really well. Whether we're out in the backyard playing a game of wiffle ball, or in the house playing pranks with whoopie cushions, it's always a fun time at my @CAPS2 @PERSON1's house. During the rough times of the divorce, I would spend a lot of time at my @CAPS2's house because I didn't have to worry about being questioned all the time about how I was feeling; I just had to worry about if I should bring sneakers to go on a hike, or if I should bring my pajamas in case we decided to have a movie night sleepover. That house is a place I still go to just relax, and forget about whatever @MONTH1 be worrying me. @CAPS2 @PERSON1's is a safe haven for me to just let go, and have a good time with some of my favorite people in the world; my family.  If I didn't have all these important people in my life, I don't know what would have become of me. As I grow up, I'm realizing that these people have molded the person I am today. They helped me through the roughest time in my life, and that proves how much they really care about me. Some say laughter is the best medicine; I say it's love. Laughing helps to get you through terrible times, but the people who make you laugh are really what matter most. I can honestly say that every one of these people have made me a better person, and I love them with all my heart."	25	25		50				5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	4	5	5						
21500	8	" Do you ever have those weekends when you hang out your best friend and just spend the whole time laughing? Many people don't get the chance to have a day filled with laughter because they don't have people to laugh with. In my case I am always laughing and always surrounded with people that never stop laughing. My best friend is one of the funniest people I know. I could be in the worst of moods and @CAPS14 always knows how to put a smile on my face. @ORGANIZATION1 and I hang out all the time. Every time we @CAPS11 together we @CAPS11 constantly laughing to the point to where we cant breathe. One day we were both just having a rough day. All the drama with friends and boyfriends was putting so much weight on our shoulders. I was sitting at home on the couch when I get a phone call from @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS11 you doing today?"" @ORGANIZATION1 asked. ""@CAPS2 just sitting at home watching movies. You?"" I replied ""@CAPS3 i am having a bad day, would you wanna come over or something?"" @ORGANIZATION1 said in an upset tone. ""@CAPS4. Hold on, let me ask."" I said as I was running to my parents room. My parents of course said yes. About an hour later I got picked up by @CAPS5 dad. When I got in the car I could just tell by the way @CAPS14 looked that @CAPS14 was having a bad day and just needed to have some fun. When we got back to her house we went in her room and started talking. About five minutes after the conversation had started we were both crying like babies because of the problems that were going on. we weren't only crying because of sad things. There was a point in the conversation where we were laughing so hard that we started to cry again. @ORGANIZATION1 and I could sit there for hours and laugh to the point where there was no stopping us. @CAPS3 that day was the day. @CAPS5 dad walked in the room because of all the noise. ""@CAPS1 is going on in here?"" @CAPS7 asked with a stern voice. ""@CAPS8 dad."" We said still laughing. ""@CAPS9 then."" @CAPS7 replied with a really confused face walking out of the room. Closing the door behind him. That made us laugh even harder. We were laughing so hard that @ORGANIZATION1 fell off of her bed. ""@CAPS11 you @CAPS9!"" I tried asking but it didn't really come out because I was laughing so hard. All @ORGANIZATION1 could do was roll on the floor laughing. @CAPS13 you knew @ORGANIZATION1 you would know that once @CAPS14 gets going @CAPS14 thinks that everything in the universe is funny, literally. The rest of the night we just sat on her bed and talked about everything. Stuff that either happened two years ago or just happened that week. I remember her telling me a story about when @CAPS14 lived somewhere else and it was seriously the funniest story i have ever heard. I've been best friends with her for three years now and I never get sick of her. Some people that hang out with @ORGANIZATION1 and I don't really understand why half the stuff we say is funny. A few months ago we were hanging out with some friends and all of the sudden @ORGANIZATION1 screamed, ""@CAPS12 on my finger!"" @CAPS13 you were to just hear that from someone you would @CAPS2 be disgusted but when @CAPS14 screamed that I started laughing so hard my stomach hurt. One time when we were sitting in her room @CAPS14 wanted to paint my nails and @CAPS14 picked this ugly brownish gold color. @CAPS14 started to paint my nails. ""@ORGANIZATION1 it looks like i have @CAPS12 on my finger!"" I said in a loud voice. ""I think it looks very nice."" @CAPS14 replied with this certain smile on her face. Ever since that night @CAPS12 on my finger has always been our inside joke. @ORGANIZATION1 and I have the funnest times together. Times that you can only have with a best friend. The hours we spend just sitting there laughing over the simplest things you couldn't do with anyone else. I am so thankful to have someone that I can share all this laughter with. Remember, you @CAPS11 lucky that you have people that can make you laugh. Like I said not everyone has that person in there life."	17	20		37				4	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21507	8	" To me laughter shows the importance of life. I have always felt that in any situation whether @CAPS3 or bad laughter can completely change the way people handle those situations. When it comes to a relationship simply laughing can help anyone. Laughing symbolizes happiness and it is more than important for the people in a relationship to be happy. I have had many horrible situations where just laughing has helped us work through it. Laughing has always changed @CAPS1 mood and helped me through situations. When you get yourself so worked up about little things you forget about the @CAPS3 things in life and begin to lose your patients with each other, this has happened to me a lot. A time this happened to me was when me and @CAPS1 boyfriend were on our way to @LOCATION1 and it seemed like everything about that trip was going wrong. We went to @LOCATION1 for a vacation away from our hectic home life's and ended up wishing we were anywhere but where we were! They had over booked our hotel, our car broke down, @CAPS1 credit card account was being help for @NUM1 hours and it seemed as if that trip was the biggest mistake we had ever made. There was so much tension between us that we couldn't even look at each other without getting into a fight. We ended up going to some cheap hotel and spending the only cash we had. The next morning things got so bad that just being in the same room made us want to lash out and kill each other. He ended up leaving for the day and we didn't talk @TIME1 when he came back, but even when he got back after not being together or a day it was still hard being around each other. The next morning we woke up and by this time we were both fed up and have had more then enough. The only thing we did was mope around and fight, this made us realize we were really stuck and this vacation could no longer be called a vacation. There was no one we knew around to loan us money, no banks only an @CAPS2 and we realized we were not at our dream vacation destination more like in a nightmare. We had pretty much given up and lost faith in actually having a ""@CAPS3 vacation"" and had given up on each other. We were done, wanted nothing to do with each other or this nightmare anymore. This nightmare had ruined who we thought we were and we no longer looked at each other as a happy couple anymore, but more as two people who completely despised each other. The next day I decided to call @CAPS1 bank and see what was going on with @CAPS1 account, it turned out i forgot i changed @CAPS1 pin number to access @CAPS1 account. The entire time i kept entering the wrong pin so they locked @CAPS1 account to be sure someone was trying to break into it. I could not even describe how dumb I felt. I knew that as soon as I came back with the news even though it seemed like things would be alright, they wouldn't. When i arrived back at the hotel I could feel the tension as soon as I walked into the room. I began packing @CAPS1 stuff and when he caught on to what i was doing he asked where I was going, I replied ""to luxury"". Instantly his face lit up and he asked ""how"" and after I explained to him what had happened he instantly began laughing and hugged me. I knew as soon as i saw that smile on his face and heard laughter that things between us would be alright after all. We finally had the money to rent a car, and get to our dream destination. When we arrived at the hotel things were going great, we were smiling and laughing and actually enjoying ourselves. I can honestly say that even though all those horrible situations happened that I enjoyed our trip. I strongly believe that everything happens for a reason and that reason led us to a week full of laughter and true happiness."	20	16		36				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	3						
21513	8	"                       Laughter   @CAPS1 is like a drug that works better than any other painkiller, or anti-depressant out there. It makes angry people happy, and happy people ecstatic. One of the best ways and more common ways to have a good laugh is by watching a funny movie. Any time I'm asked @CAPS10's your favorite comedy I say ""@CAPS2 with @PERSON1"". I remember the first time I watched a @PERSON1 movie. I was about @NUM1 years young; I was in second grade, it was towards the end of the school year, and I couldn't wait to get out for the @DATE1 and just have fun. It was any ordinary boring day @CAPS7 school and I remember walking home hoping there would be something fun to do when I got home. I walked in the door to see my brother watching @CAPS3, I asked him @CAPS10 he was watching but he just ignored me so I went to my room to do homework. I finished my homework and walked into the living room and plopped down on the couch next to my brother, I asked @CAPS10 he was watching a second time, he let out an annoyed sigh and said some movie called ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" was about to start. Within the first five minutes we were already @CAPS1, not just giggling or slightly chuckling, tears were rolling down our faces from all the @CAPS1. I remember saying to my brother ""@CAPS6 is the funniest movie I've ever seen!"" @CAPS7 the end of the movie my brother and I couldn't stop quoting the movie, every @NUM2 seconds we'd quote it, it was non stop laughter. We sat there on the couch patiently waiting to see @CAPS10 was on next wishing and hoping it was another movie as incredible as the one we just watched, and sure enough after the commercial break we learned that it was a @PERSON1 marathon, and on next was ""@CAPS8 @CAPS9"". The movie started out just as funny as the last one, with @PERSON1 doing something completely idiotic, yet absolutely hilarious, like growling @CAPS7 some dogs over a loudspeaker. We couldn't get enough of @CAPS6 guy, my brother was rolling on the floor @CAPS1 and crying, and I was still watching waiting to see @CAPS10 happened next. About half way through the movie my mom got home from work, she walked in to see my brother and I in hysterics, she said ""@CAPS10's so funny?"" We just pointed @CAPS7 the @CAPS3 right as @PERSON1 started rolling down a hill. Soon enough our mom was watching it too, @CAPS1 just as hard as we were. I was having a great time, a genuinely great time with my family, @CAPS10 more could I ask for? How about another @PERSON1 movie? On next was a movie called ""@CAPS12 @CAPS13 @CAPS14"", completely ridiculous, and completely hilarious, @CAPS10's funnier than an overweight guy trying to be a @CAPS14? We continued to watch the movie until dinner time, we inhaled our food as fast as we could and then raced back to the couch to continue watching. When it was time for bed I remember staying up late reciting quotes from the movie in our bunk beds until our mom came in and told us to be quiet. I don't know how we slept @CAPS7 all after @CAPS1 all night. The movies left us speechless, we had never seen @CAPS2 funnier, they made us laugh, they made us cry, they made our stomachs ache, and through it all it brought my brother and I closer. To @CAPS6 day my brother and I can sit down and watch one of those movies and laugh and remember all the times we have watched them before and all the laughs we shared, I swear half of my childhood consisted of @CAPS1, and @PERCENT1 of that @CAPS1 came from those movies. The movies helped me to develop a funny personality, they shaped @CAPS10 I think is humorous, and they make me realize that after sharing something so funny with someone I love, that laughter is an important aspect in our lives, without it life would be plain and dull like a meaningless blob of clay. Have you ever gone a day without @CAPS1? If so you know how long and dull it can get without having something that brings a smile to your face there. Laughter brings people together, it brings out the best in us, when you're mad or upset the best way to cure your anger or frustration is by having a good laugh.

21530	8	" Laughter, one of the most joyous things there is to experience in this world. Everyone can relate to it and there's no one out there who would say that they don't enjoy laughing. It's human nature to want and to need to be connected to other people; we are social beings, and laughter is the best way to connect to other people. There is no negativity in laughing, unless that is if you are laughing at a rude comment, and in general, if people are laughing, they would say they're having a good time. People build relationships around experiences that they have with other people, for example dating. On a first date, it's to be expected, and an important factor, for the two people to be having fun and laughing. Other wise, when they separate from each other and are only left with their thoughts, their impression could make or break the relationship. That's why a first impression is so important. When the two people are reminiscing about the date that they just had, if they remember smiling and laughing, then they will most likely have a positive memory of their experience and want to hang out again. Think about any experience you have ever had with another person. If you remember the first time you met them, and how you felt afterward, the way you felt then, could tell you a lot about how the relationship went. Meeting new people, it's difficult, but you ask anyone about how to start a conversation with someone new, and they will usually tell you, ""make them laugh"". It's a universal term, anyone can do it. This past month, basketball season has started and I am playing on a whole different team then I did last year. Only half the girls on my team last year are still here, and I have had to make a connection with girls who are younger then me, and who I haven't yet gotten to know. I start to think about all the new girls, and who I have already made connections with and how I'm now good friends with most of them because of laughter. Everyday we get closer and closer because we find ways to laugh with each other out on the court. No matter how difficult the practice @MONTH1 get, you can never become to exhausted when someone is making you laugh. Laughter is needed in life to make it more livable. Think about it. If you could never laugh again, what would be fun about life? Image life if it were like detention all the time, never being able to just let loose, relax and have a good time. No one would want that. People would go insane, laughter calms people down and mellows them out. It helps create people's personalities and can affect others as well. Laughter is like a ripple in the water, it starts as just one single person, then expands out touching anyone near it. Laughing is contagious, like a @CAPS1 in mid @DATE1, and brings joy to you and the people you can touch.  Laughter, it's the foundation of happiness."	25	21		46				5	5	5	5	5	5	5	4	5	4	4	4						
21531	8	"   @LOCATION3 has always been my place of choice to travel to whenever my parents question me of where I would like to go during the @DATE1. The rolling green hills, stunning sunsets, and thrilling thunderstorms are certainly a large part for my reason to go, but the idea of seeing my @CAPS7's side of the family again overpowers all of my other reasons. The core of my @LOCATION3 family has always been my @CAPS1 @CAPS2; with her friendly smile, caring personality, and a sharp sense of humor, she makes friends and acquaintances wherever she goes. Yet, due to the fact that we live hundreds of miles apart, I'm only able to see @CAPS1 @CAPS2 three times each year: my family drives up to her house twice every @DATE1, and she drives down to my grandparent's house for a few weeks in the @DATE2. I cherish every moment I spend with her, especially when she accidentally makes a fool of herself and causes hysterics.   A few summers ago, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, my @CAPS7, and I traveled up to @LOCATION2 to check out some of the town's antique and flower shops before dinner. We had spent a few hours driving around town, scoping out all of these shops to raid them of any gems that either @CAPS7 or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 must have for their already old-fashioned homes. I had lost interest after the first few hours; antique shopping was never a passion of mine, and I was ready to take the one hour trip back to @LOCATION1 to go swimming with my cousins.     Once @CAPS7 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had spent most of their money on a couple of ""treasures"" a few hours later, we were exhausted and prepared to head home when we happened upon a pizza shop down the main street. Our mouths watered at the thought of eating a slice, but rather than going inside to eat, we ordered a pizza to take home and bake instead. In her white @ORGANIZATION2 pick-up, my @CAPS1 pulled into the shop's parking lot, leaving @CAPS7 and I inside while she grabbed the pizza. Upon her return a few minutes later, the aroma of the pizza wafted through the cab, making our mouths water and our desire to get home to grow exponentially. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 placed the pizza in the back seat, grabbed her coffee, and revved up the engine. We were all lost in our own thoughts about sneaking a slice of pizza when suddenly the front tires of the pick up dipped down and thumped onto the road. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 nearly dropped her hot coffee all over her lap, while @CAPS7 panicked and grabbed the handle on the door in reflex. We were all flabbergasted, stunned as little kids trying to grasp that the @ORGANIZATION1 didn't exist. Moments after the initial panic, we realized that @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had accidentally driven over the curb. We burst into laughter while poor @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had a red-rose face and an apologetic smile wider than the @ORGANIZATION3. She cautiously drove with the traffic, laughing hysterically with tears in her sea blue eyes along with @CAPS7 and I.   Our hysteria episode lasted for a few minutes, in which time @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had pulled into a vacant parking lot; none of us wanted another unplanned adventure on the road. I wiped the tears from my eyes, trying to stifle the laughter and recompose myself. @CAPS7 was still giggling and wiping the mascara off her face. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was doing the same, and then turned around to look at me. She locked her bright eyes with mine and smiled as sweetly as only she could, and we burst into more hysterics.   After @CAPS28 next small hysterical episode was over, we were finally able to pull back onto the street with the rest of civilization. As @CAPS1 @CAPS2 pulled out cautiously, I burst out, ""@CAPS27 not to run over anymore curbs!"" @CAPS28 drew up another round of laughter.  @CAPS1 @CAPS2 has always been there for me, through the laughter and the tears. Because we are family, we have a natural bond between each other. Yet without laughter, @CAPS28 bond would not be nearly as close and glued together as it currently is. Hundreds of miles of farmland and open road separates us. The occasional phone calls and e-mails are all we have to communicate between each other. My @CAPS1 is the most caring, humorous, and loving person I have ever encountered, and I unfortunately don't get to spend as much time with her as I would like. But every time I see her, I smile and think of the comical stories we have between each other. Without the humor and laughter we share, our bond would not be as close as it is, and we would both be clueless to our current world of joy."	23	27	50	50				4	4	4	5	5	5	6	6	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5
21533	8	" My dad and i went out to teach me how to drive after recently getting my permit. I was nervous in the beginning ofcourse, but quickly became comfortable behind the wheel. I drove all over town completeing some errands we had to do along the way. Now it was time to go through the car wash, my first time in a carwash with me in control. I didnt think a car wash would be difficult to achieve after driving all around town, but i was wrong. After having a hard time pulling up to the right spot so the wash could start i had to roll up all the windows and fold the side view mirrors. Before i could do all that the wash had started! As a hurricane of soap swirled around the car i rushed to fold the side view mirror and was succesful. Unfortunately due to my slow reaction times i could not also roll up my driver window as the soap came back around and enveloped me in white foam. My dad and i were all wet and the inside of the car got all cleaned even though that wasnt the plan at first. I finally rolled up my window looked at my dad. He looked back at me not saying anything, the car was silent. After our minds finally developed wat happened we broke out in laughter. We had not stoppped laughing through the whole car wash and after because of the rarity of that situation. All i could say after that was that people go there whole lives without having that type of car wash incident, so why did it have to happen to me!"	17	18		35				3	3	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	3						
21540	8	" Laughter in my life is one of the most important things, because it is often the motivation I need. Whether it be an embarrassing situation that I laugh at looking back on, or when I'm feeling angry and my best friend does something to make me crack up. Sometimes I just feel sad, and if I'm around the right people, the ones who bring the laughter out in me, I know it won't last long. I know that to get my mind off of something, all I need are a few giggle here and there.  Recently, I started going to the gym. I have always been overweight and out of shape, so the gym, like many other attempts, seemed like it wouldn't last long. When taking the tour of my gym originally with my mom, who suggested we try it out, I was pretty excited. Of course this was because it was something new, and I was pumped up enough that I wanted to start that day. My mom, being the more logical one, and of course, the one who would be paying monthly for the membership, wanted to think and talk it over a bit more. In the end, my mom decided that it was right for us. At first my mom kept me motivated. Because I was so out of shape, I got tired after five minutes on the elliptical, at the easiest setting. Seeing my mom beside me on the treadmill, working at it and not even slowing, kept me motivated. Just looking at her made me so happy that every now and then I'd just let out a short burst of laughter, followed by a questioning look from her, but then she would also laugh. Sometimes I thought it was just because I was tired and somewhat delirious from the exertion, but looking back on it now I know I was just happy that my mom and I finally had something to do together. The happy gym days were short-lived, because as usual, my mom was too tired and whatnot to go anymore. I promised myself to go once I was able to drive myself regularly. A few weeks after my birthday, I got my license, but another thing got in the way; my car was a @NUM1-speed, and I only knew @CAPS1 to drive automatic. So after begging my mom almost every day to take me to practice on my new car, she finally took me. In the dark church parking lot, the same one I started driving automatic in, more laughter between us started. She would have me close my eyes and ""feel"" where the clutch and accelerator @CAPS2 about halfway. At first I thought this was so absurd that I would just start cracking up, and my mom would join in with her laugh. Once I finally got the hang of taking off, which to me is the hardest part, but, like always, laughter was there to make things easier. I learned to drive stick quickly, and because I had made that promise to myself, my first trip for myself was to the gym. My motivation that time was being able to finally do something progressive just for me, and the satisfaction was doing it by myself. The whole way to the gym, I sang @PERSON1 in the twangiest voice I could muster, which led to more laughter. The first few times of going to the gym were based solely on the knowledge that I was doing something good for myself. After about the fourth time, though, my motivation started to dwindle. Instead of listening to my iPod while on the elliptical, I started to watch ""@CAPS1 I @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4,"" because it would get laughs out of me while I was still working my butt off. Before I knew it, the episode was over and I had been going strong for almost an hour, burning @NUM2 calories. I was so impressed with what I had accomplished that it felt like the motivation was fully replenished. I started going daily again. In a week and a half, I had lost @NUM3 pounds just by going to the gym, working out, and most of all, laughing. Part of it was self-motivation, but another part was the laughter that so easily distracted me from the task at hand. Because I had been getting into shape, I was also able to increase the ""@CAPS5"" level on the machine, and am still going every day. Each day it feels easier and easier, and now I have ""@CAPS6"" and ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8"" to make me laugh even more while working out. I believe that in many cases, laughter has saved me. Whether I be sad, mad, down, or in this case, not motivated enough, it was always an option. Knowing I have those laughs to look forward to at the end of the day makes me keep getting in my car to drive to the gym. I'm still losing weight, and this is the first time in my life I've felt truly energized. Laughter was a huge part."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
21544	8	" I choose to have a positive out look on life and I'm generally a happy person. Who wants to go through life mad all the time? Even at my lowest I know that I have a lot to be thankful for. Because of this, laughter is an every day factor of my life. When I'm with friends and family I am always laughing. Laughter is my medicine and I wouldn't be the same girl with out it. When I was in the fourth grade my family and I began going to a new @CAPS3 I didn't know any one there and I was really nervous about going to @DATE1 @TIME1. Mom walked me down the stairs to the classroom and the teacher introduced herself to me. Her name was @PERSON1. She was pretty and very tall with a funny australian accent. She was wearing alligator skin boots with black jeans and a pink top. Ms. @PERSON1 introduced me to the class stating my name and grade. after taking my seat we recited @CAPS1 versus and read short clips of @CAPS2 stories. When @CAPS3 had ended mom came downstairs to gt me. Reculctant as I was to see her I took hold of her hand, said bye to @PERSON1,and went back upstairs without one word from any of the other kids, but on our way upstairs a girl about my age, from which i recognized from the class said goodbye to me. I returned her nice gesture with a smile and a wave. One week later mom took me downstairs to @ORGANIZATION1. This time I was relentless and determined to make a new friend. I went and sat down next to the girl who said goodbye to me last week. I introduced myself to her and she told me her name was @PERSON2. We soon became very close. Every week I was so excited for @CAPS3 so I could spend time with @ORGANIZATION2. We became best friends! We played on the same soccer team together and we pretty much live at one anothers houses. In fact @PERSON2 has her own toothbrush at my house and I have one at her house as well. One time @PERSON2 and I were in @CAPS3, and now that we are older we go to the main service, we laughed so hard we almost peed our pants! @PERSON2 and I have so many great memories together and though we are becoming older the memories will last forever."	15	16		31				3	3	3	4	3	3	4	3	4	4	3	3						
21552	8	" Laughter is the best medicine for a friend in pain. My friend @CAPS1 and I were best friends, he came to my house every weekend. So while I waited for him I decided to ride my bike. I road around the block a couple of times, when I hit a curb and crashed. My handle bar hit me in the lower rib cage. My mom took my to the doctors office to see if I broke a rib. The doctor said I had only bruised it.  On the way home I was in so much pain, my mom made a stop for some ice cream, that didn't help. When we got home I just lade on the couch for a while. I heard knocking, it was @CAPS1. The first thing he did was asked what happened, I said I didn't wont to talk about it rite now. We ate diner then played a game. Then we watched some movies eventually we both fell asleep.  We woke to the smell of bacon. I was still a little asleep, by the time I realized that I had woke up @CAPS1 was down stars. I was in so much pain I couldn't get up. So I just lade there for a short while. @CAPS1 came back up the stares to see why I didn't get up. He seen me just laying there. We just started to laugh, I noticed that i felt a little better but I didn't think much of it. After we ate we turned on the @NUM1, my mom said for every one to clean but @CAPS1 and I could play, cause I was hurt and @CAPS1 was a guest. We play mortal combat @NUM2, @CAPS6 and @PERSON1, and @CAPS7 and @ORGANIZATION1. I won most of the time, tell he started to cheat, but it was still pretty fun.  When we were done we watched a funny movie, we laugh so much, that when it was I almost for got about my rib cage. We went to the park to shoot some hoops. As soon as he shot it then it bounced off the rim and hit him in the face, I thought that was funny, he didn't seem to think so. When we got bored we headed down to the market to get a snack. When we were eating I told him what happened with my bike, he ask if it made a visible mark, we look and seen it look just liked a smile face, it was funny but creepy. When we got home, he said that he wanted to ride bikes. At first I was a little scared, but nothing big. We rode around my yard for while. His mom got their shortly after. Then I went inside and just sat there. My mom asked how i felt, but it didn't hurt any more. I got better because laughter is the best medicine."	15	18		33				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	3

That the joy from friend and you to reales the tens strees from school. I always go home with a smile. Theres always jokes to tell to have joy. When the bell rings with in the end of my last class, I am tierd from working hard. When I go to my bus located on the front of the school. I feel strees out from the work I had to do. But I can't wait till my friends come to the bus. We always have a great time. I comepletely forget about school and laugh with the jokes and rediculace story we say. When we get to the first stop everyone gets out with joy even me. This prosses has lasted for three years. But the next year is going to be ower last ride from the bus @NUM1 my favorite number.

21557	8	" Have you ever laughed so hard that you cry? Your chest is bubbling with the laughter, and tears spilling out of your eyes; faces turn bright red and your body is practically having convulsions. This is not the forced kind of laughter, this is uncontrollable. This is pure joy. I laugh like this at least twice a day, tears and all. If it is even possible for your laugh reflexes to be connected to tear ducts, I swear I would have it. If I have a good laugh during the day, then I wont be so sad later to come. It has made me a much happier person. And it has even been able to bring me together with other people.  @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was not a time when laughter was abundant in my life. This was a time in my life where I worried and would dwell on the past. I was a deep fourth grader. But my friends were much different. @CAPS4 did have their bad moods on occasion, and whenever we were feeling down we would sit on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Very creative, I know. This @CAPS2 was navy blue, and sat right at the corner of the playground right where the baseball field started. We would sit there and watch the whole playground during recess while reflecting on our stressful lives.  One day as we were dismissed to recess, four of my close friends and I went over to the @CAPS2. We watched as the boys ran as fast as @CAPS4 could to the field to get their daily game of football started. Almost every guy in the @ORGANIZATION1 would go to the baseball field and play touch football. It was the cool thing for the @ORGANIZATION1 studs. And sometimes the girls joined in too. While we were sitting there sulking on the @CAPS2, a few boys walked up to us.  ""@CAPS3 to play some football with us? We could use more people!"" @CAPS4 said. We weren't in the mood for playing football, but with the persistent nagging, we had to give in. The square field was soggy from the @ORGANIZATION2 rain, and the grass turned into muddy mush wherever you stepped. Us girls would avoid any contact and we ran much slower then the boys. But we managed to score a few points for our team, and duck for cover when needed. The football lightened our moods, and was much better at making us happy then the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. So a new tradition was formed. Every day we would go out with the boys and not have a care in the world as we chased each other around. We dove into the mushy mess of a field to save a ball, and lunged to tag any person we could get to. The @CAPS2 was out of all of our minds as we ran around having fun.  But one day while we were playing it was extra muddy from a storm the night before. It was hard to navigate as you were running around on the slick field. People were slipping and falling constantly. And then something amazing happened, it started raining all over again. But nobody had even thought of quitting. We just laughed and kept going. The rain blinded us, and the slick ground was no help. So a collision was inevitable. One of the girls picked up the football. The ball had been through a lot, and now it was covered in mud. She had a clear shot of the end zone, and sprinted the best she could given the circumstance. When out of nowhere a boy from the other team popped up in front of her. But instead of swerving to miss hitting him, she slid. It was a priceless moment, almost taken from a cartoon. Her legs slid out from under her and she landed square on her butt. Everyone on the field was already peeling over, clutching their stomachs from the laughter. But she continued to slide. The boy in front of her was too busy laughing to notice she was headed in his direction. That is when she took him out too. But he was unfortunate enough to land on his face. His body sprawled on top of hers with his head directly in the brown wet ground. Even the two that fell couldn't help but laughing. The game was halted as we all shared this priceless moment. We were brought together by a simple game of football, and uncontrollable laughter."	18	25	42	42				4	4	4	4	4	3	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	4	5	5	4	4
21561	8	" My best friend is probably my brother, @PERSON2. It was in the middle of @DATE1 and we were sitting outside on top of the wooden table in our mother's backyard. @PERSON2 started telling me how much he wanted to be done with high school and that he was, ""just done with all this."" I sat there listening attentively for maybe thirty minutes as @PERSON2 poured his heart out, and nearly broke mine with how distressed he was. @PERSON2's best friend, @PERSON1, had just told @PERSON2 that @CAPS1 he went out with the girl @PERSON2 liked, then their friendship was over. @PERSON2 was extremely hurt by this betrayal added on top of how he was afraid of getting kicked out of school because of his grades, and the amount of pressure coming from our parents at the time, was simply too much for seventeen year old @PERSON2 to handle. I talked to @PERSON2 for at least another half hour after that about what I thought he should do, at the end of our heart to heart talk I told @PERSON2 that, ""@CAPS1 you don't get it together and start geting good grades, their going to kick you out of school, @PERSON2. Honestly, @CAPS1 that happens I'm going to be really mad at you; becaus the only person @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are going to have to nag on is me."" We both laughed quietly for a minute, paused, and laughed until we cried.  I don't know to this day what was so funny, maybe how serious everything was when we were just kids or @CAPS1 it was simply a release of stress and anxiety for both of us. My tiny, little, lame joke that I dropped at the end of our talk just made it all seem okay, made us think about how young we are, how minor so many of these problems were in the grand scheme of life. That inital laughter made is possible for us to simply let go. After this happened @PERSON2 and I went on with our lives as @CAPS1 this had never happened, never speaking of it. Except that @PERSON2 never got a bad grade in the rest of his high school career, he chose his friend over a chance at the girl but found another girl who has @ORGANIZATION1's approval. Was it laughter that helped @PERSON2 get through this difficult time? I couldn't say, but what I do know is that there was laughter there and @PERSON2 did what he needed to do."	18	20	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
21563	8	" The sound of laughter could be one that breaks all barriers. Just a single giggle or quiet chuckle can expand someone's world. Laughter is a sign. It's something that tells someone new ideas, desires, or dreams are going to be created. Once one laughs, he or she getting along with someone -- they're forming a relationship. The first time @PERSON1 and I laughed together, there was no doubt in my mind it was the start of something new. Once I heard his cautious, unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle, I was set and ready to be swept off my feet.  I was privileged to hear that laugh for three days of my summer in the year @DATE2. It was a @DATE1, and for the past four days I was bounding and skipping throughout mountains and hills in the never ending desert of @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. That day, my cousin @CAPS1 and I were about to wander in to a familiar territory of ours: the mall. As a bonus, that cautious, unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle was bounding and skipping along with us. When @PERSON1 walked over to us in the food court, he definitely succeeded in playing it cool. You could tell he actually made time to comb his hair and decide what he was going to wear just to look as spiffy as he was. ""@CAPS2, hey guys!"" he called out smoothly. Our eyes met immediately, and already my cheeks hurt. The next few minutes that we spent together were crucial. I needed to make a good impression on this guy. We stood in the line of @ORGANIZATION1, where he would retrieve his usual order of two @CAPS3 @CAPS4' @CAPS5 without lettuce, a large order of fries, and a large @CAPS6. Pepper. As for me, all I wanted was a small vanilla ice cream cone. Glancing over at the other register, I saw @PERSON1 turn his head my way in the corner of my eye. ""@CAPS7, do you have @MONEY1?"" he hesitantly asked me. He fiddled with his pockets a little, while also brushing his luscious blond locks from his face. I chuckled silently to myself, and his reaction was one that is to this day one of my favorite things about him -- his smile. Still chuckling, I said ""@CAPS8,"" and carefully handed him the @MONEY1. To this day, @PERSON1 is my very best friend. Eventually, I did get back the @MONEY1 he owed me. Ever since that one moment when we were standing in the waiting line at @ORGANIZATION1, the next several hours were jam-packed with laughter. I don't really remember a single thing he said that didn't at the very least make me grin as hard as I could. Literally, with several leaps and flips, on that day I made a new friend. And even then, I was completely unaware of the amazing journey there was to come with this boy. It was all because of that very first natural instinct @PERSON1 and I both had towards each other; to laugh. If I had never laughed so hard my stomach was aching, or never laughed so hard tears were running down my cheeks, there is just no way we would have had the connection that we did. His unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle never gets old. Laughter is one of the main keys in our friendship. One of us has to let out a little cackle every once in a while. Also, @PERSON1 is still in @LOCATION2. I'm not. As badly as we both wish we could be, we're not in the same place. We need to be able to thrive and grow in separate places. So, with that, if someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" then they were absolutely correct. When @PERSON1 and I laugh together, it doesn't feel like we're fifteen hundred miles apart. So this laughter, this just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle, is an element and part of my life that I am indescribably grateful for. This laughter formed one of the greatest relationships in my short fifteen years of life, and I sincerely hope it will form many more wonderful memories in the years to come."	21	25		46				5	4	5	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
21567	8	"Laughter I've always been one who laughs a lot. It does not take much effort for me to bust out in a laughing fit, the topic doesn't even need to be that funny. I'm not the type to do the ""nervous laugh"" though. I think my laugh fits me well because I am quiet, just like my laugh. I always get a little embarrassed when my laugh gets louder than usual.  The weather lately has been very cold with snow falling here and there. I have just been itching for some good, warm swimming weather. This past weekend my boyfriend, @PERSON1, and I went up to the mountains to play in the deep snow. After a few hours of being up in the snow we headed back down the mountain to go to his house and use his hot tub.Obviously it was very cold and me, being more of a fair weather girl, just wanted to go somewhere to warm up. First we stopped by my house so i could grab my swim suite that I recently ordered off line and was dying to use it.  We left our clothes in the back room and ran out in the cold to get in the hot tub on his back patio. The hot water felt so good; it relaxed my body of ice and my tense muscles. We were in the hot tub for about forty five minutes before we noticed how hungry we were. Since we had gotten all warmed up we decided @CAPS1 sounded good. We jumped out of the hot tub and ran for the back room to dry off and get our clothes on. I had gotten all dried off and started to put my jeans back on. When I put my first leg in my jeans I just had a feeling that I was going to fall. Sure enough, when I got my second leg half way in the other side I lost my balance, tripped over a huge exercise machine, and fell hard on my butt. I started busting out laughing, along with @PERSON1, I was a bit embarrassed but at least it didn't hurt too bad. After I had gotten up and walked around for a few minutes my butt started to hurt more and more.  @PERSON1 kept making jokes about me falling, even though they were pretty funny, I tried not to laugh. He was facing me while we were having a conversation, when we were done talking he turned towards the door to leave and hit his head square on the exact same exercise machine I had tripped over just minutes before. Instantly, I was bent over laughing. I could not move, I was laughing to hard. It looked like it had to hurt when he hit his head, he had a nice red bump under his eye. He didn't find it nearly as funny as I did and just walked out the door. Still, laughing hysterically I tried to follow him out the door but it was hard to move from laughing so much. My stomach was hurting from all the laughing when it finally started to subside.  Still having a little giggle left in me, I walked to his pickup to wait for him while he was talking to his dad. When I turned around to see if he was coming I started laughing again just seeing him walking to the pick up. The look on his face when he seen me laughing again was just priceless. I could imagine why I looked ridiculous to him; sitting all by myself in his pickup laughing hysterically again.  Laughter is one of the very few things in this world that is free. Everybody's laugh is unique and can change due to the situation. There are many different laughs a person can have such as nervous, happy, giddy, and so on. If people can share a laugh it can bring them together. Through out the world laughter is a universal sign of happiness. People of any age, race, or religion can share a laugh. Over all, laughter is just a great feeling."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
21569	8	" It all started when my eighth grade class had a plan to go see a movie together. I had the idea to see a movie, so i picked a few movies that were in theaters. The choices were between, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2,' @CAPS3 of the @CAPS4,' and another movie that i cant remember. We, as a group, decided to go to @CAPS3 of the @CAPS4. The movie stars @PERSON1, and @CAPS7 from @CAPS8 @CAPS9. I thought that the movie was really good but there was one part in the movie that made me laugh so so hard. The scene starts out with @PERSON1 and @CAPS7 wandering around trying to find a place to stay for the night; and they seemed to have @CAPS4 @LOCATION1; @LOCATION1 plays an important part on the movie. After a long day full of scary situations, they find a good size cave that they decide is a good spot to stay for the night.   Back tracking a little bit, earlier that day, and in the movie, @PERSON1 came across a native fellow named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is a a man like creature that walked like a monkey but has the face of a human but has an all around harry body. They came across him while traveling through the desert and saved him from execution; for that, @LOCATION1 is very grateful and is @CAPS11 guide around the mysterious @CAPS3 that is foreign to man and that has never been seen by man.  Back to what i was talking abot earlier, when @PERSON1 and @CAPS7 end up in the cave the see two full body skeletons sitting at a table that has an old record player on it, but the record is playing and making music. Just a second later @LOCATION1 comes in the frame of the scene and does a little dance that puts him close to, but in front of the table. Then @LOCATION1 does multiple pelvis thrusts to different directions, basically humping the air.  Watching that scene made me laugh the hardest that i have ever laughed in my life. To this day i look back at it and laugh just as hard as i did the first time i saw the movie.  About a month later, I went over to one of my good friends houses and we watched the movie again. When we got to the scene of @CAPS13 jig, we both fell down, off of the couch laughing. We replayed that scene about ten more times and ended up crying because we were laughing so hard.  Laughter is good for the soul and moral, and for friendship building. Thank the @CAPS14 that he made us laugh!"	18	16		34				3	3	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	4	4	3

It is a story about me @CAPS11 my friends @CAPS11 a little adventure we had @DATE1, a day we would never forget. It starts off on one of the nicest days i had ever seen, i mean amazing, blue sky's, warm @DATE1 air, @CAPS11 the sound of the laughter coming from the children playing in the street. Me @CAPS11 my three friends @PERSON3, @PERSON1, @CAPS11 @CAPS2 were sitting on my back porch in a circle playing our guitars, as usual @CAPS11 we decided that we needed to go do something, something new. As we sat @CAPS11 thought about what we could do nothing came to mind. Until @PERSON1 suggested that we go to the beach @CAPS11 meet up with his cousin ""@CAPS3 has a nice house right on the beach @CAPS11 probably wouldn't care if we stopped by."" @CAPS3 said. The three of us looked at each other @CAPS11 looked an @PERSON1 @CAPS11 said ""lets go!"" We packed our boards, guitars, @CAPS11 food @CAPS11 we headed out. On the way we decided to go to the @CAPS4 city skate park, none of us had ever been @CAPS5. We drove around for at least an hour looking for it. Aggravated @CAPS11 about to give up on finding the park we decided to take one @DATE1 loop @CAPS11 @CAPS10 what happened. ""@CAPS5 it is"" yelled @CAPS2 ""@CAPS5's the park i found it."" We looked off in the distance @CAPS11 @CAPS5 it was. The cradle, the snake run, everything. we pulled in @CAPS11 parked. We got out of the car ready to skate, but then out of nowhere it started pouring @CAPS11 the park was soaked. we headed back to the car seeking shelter only to find that @PERSON3 had locked his keys in the car. Luckily @CAPS3 had @CAPS7 so @CAPS3 called them @CAPS11 had them come @CAPS11 unlock the car. it took them an hour @CAPS11 a half to find us @CAPS11 unlock the car. Now we were all mad @CAPS11 wondering if it was a good choice to go on this trip. @CAPS8 leaving the park we decided it would just be best if we went to @PERSON1's cousins house @CAPS11 stayed @CAPS5 for the @TIME1. When we got @CAPS5 we were greeted with open arms @CAPS11 warm clothes, ""looks like you guys have had a rough one"" @CAPS3 said, ""I'm @PERSON2, I'm sure @PERSON1 has told you all about me by now."" @CAPS8 we changed in to the clothes @PERSON2 had given us we went @CAPS11 sat by his fireplace to warm up. The five of us sat @CAPS5 @CAPS11 talk for what felt like forever. Then I said ""i wish we could have a big fire on the beach."" ""we can"" @PERSON2 said, ""i know the perfect place."" @CAPS3 took us to a small bay on the beach about @NUM1 yards away from his house, @CAPS3 called it driftwood bay. ""@CAPS10, told you i had the perfect spot."" @CAPS11 it was perfect, secluded, sandy, @CAPS11 all the firewood you could ever need. We built a fire @CAPS11 kept throwing wood on it until it was over @NUM2 feet tall. For the rest of the day @CAPS11 on through the @TIME1 we sat around the fire, playing our guitars in a circle, @CAPS11 telling the story of our day. Laughing @CAPS11 noticing that even tho the beginning of our day wasn't very fun we closed it the only way we could have wanted, sitting around a fire, music playing in the @TIME1, @CAPS11 sharing a good laugh with your friends."	17	18		35				4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
21587	8	"I think laughter is one of the most important things people need to do in life. The more you laugh in life it makes it so much better and easier. Its better to laugh at something that's bad, like for example falling by someone or even making a simple mistake. It makes life not so difficult and more simple and easy. Laughing can make people happy and enjoy things better and possibly help them look forward to things in the future and help them conquer things that they wanna do in life. One thing that always make me laugh is my family and friends. They make everything easier for me by making me laugh. They don't always say the smartest or funniest thing in the world but it means a lot to me that they do it that. Especially when im not feeling upset or i just happened to not in a good mood, they say something that ll make me laugh and i usually feel a lot better knowing that they made me laugh to make me feel myself again. Most simple things make me laugh more and be happy. Like for example if someone says something totally stupid and know one else laugh's but me. But one thing that normally doesn't make me laugh is if someone got hurt pretty bad, like if they tripped. I wouldn't laugh at that because i wouldn't want someone to laugh at me if i fell and got hurt. I always hate when people brag about stuff that know else knows about that happened to them, like for example if they talk about they did over the @DATE1 and how ""high"" or ""drunk"" they got. Its really annoying to me and also very pointless because when they talk about it I never pay attention or just walk away because all that stuff annoys the heck out of me. Why would i wanna hear about how your ruining your life? Especially at a young age or even at all. Well that's my story and why i think the benefits or laughter is important."	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21620	8	" Everyone knows how important a laugh can be. Everyone has a different laugh, it can be powerful and moving or devastating and hurtful. Someone said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I agree with this statement, everyone has a different laugh and and laughs for many different reasons, laughing is so powerful, someone can make you laugh when your upset or unhappy and they could change everything and how you are feeling. Laughing is a way of connecting with others, you laugh when you are having a good time, are hurt and need someone. Laughs are surprising you never know when your going to laugh and for what, it could be from a little joke or a funny elaborate story being told to you.  Over the @DATE1 I was moving back to @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1, and I was very nervous and scared to be the new kid again. Even though I knew some people from when I used to live here, nothing was going to change the fact that I was the new kid. Not too long after I moved I got reconnected with some old friends of mine that I have known since the second grade when I lived here before. My friends and I are always having a good time, laughing, and just being crazy. All of us girls have been through a lot the past few years and that @DATE1, and it was nice to see them and talk to them again after all that has happened to us, we have all gone of and done our own thing and became friends with different people, but we are still close friends after all this time. It was good to spend time with them and see how much they have changed. We have all changed a lot in the past few years. And we @MONTH1 have fought caused some drama and some of us moved away, but we have been through almost everything together since we were little kids and probably will still be friends through out high school and collage.  @DATE1 was almost over and school would be starting again me and three other friends of mine wanted to something all together one last time before school started. So we planed to have one big sleepover. one of the friends lives in @LOCATION2, and she was able to come out to @PERSON1 and have this sleepover with us. It was just like second grade again, I don't think I have ever laughed as hard in my life. Not long after we all got there, we were laughing, talking, and having a great time. That night we were all sleeping over, we were thinking of something fun to do, and of my friends decided it would be fun to go @CAPS1'ing, so we asked her mom if it was @CAPS2 and she said as long as we don't go to far way from home and we have our phones on us in case we need to call her and have her pick us up. It was still a little too early for @CAPS1'ing, so until we waited for it to get dark, we walked to the store down the street from her house and bought bags and bags of toilet paper. It still wasn't dark or late enough to go, so we watched some movies, went to the mall, and stuck our feet in her hot tub. I was nice being back and being with all my old friends again. We stayed up and finally it was dark and late, so we put on all of the black clothes we owned and disguised our selves so no would could recognize us, we looked pretty convincing. We put on big jackets so we could hide the toilet paper in our jackets and if someone saw us walking they wouldn't see any of the toilet paper. We tried to be quit and sneak up on houses, but it dint work, we were so loud, we could not stop talking or laughing. We were being so loud we couldn't hear some other kids out late on their bikes also. They got closer and close and we realized it was some other guy friends we know from school, they got board and went for a bike ride. They helped us @CAPS1 some houses and it was getting really late, so we decided to head back.  This @DATE1 was one I will never forget, we had so much fun and we agreed we have never laughed so much for anything. It was a hard year for all of us and it was great to see some familiar faces and spend time with some true friends like we used to."	18	15		33				4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	4	4	3	3						
21621	8	" Laughter is an important part of my family. We laugh together, we breathe together, and we'll die together. When it comes to a family the most important thing that brings @CAPS1 as one besides having fun, loving each other, and spending quality time together is what makes @CAPS1 laugh and what keeps @CAPS1 close. For me, my siblings, and parents we always have to have a good time and laugh, whether one is upset or the other is mad. It doesn't matter what the situation is @CAPS3's always a time where we have the best times even @CAPS2 points when one of us doesn't want to see one another. I was spending an adventurous day with one of my close friends, @LOCATION1 and we decided it was time to go home and get ready so I could go spend the night @CAPS2 her house. When @LOCATION1 and I stepped in my house @CAPS3 was so much commotion going on and yelling that we decided maybe we should sit down and figure out what was going on. As we sat down we began to bust up laughing @CAPS2 the sight of my step dad, @PERSON1 yelling @CAPS2 my oldest sister, @ORGANIZATION1. We didn't know what had just happened, but we really wanted to find out. ""I can't believe @CAPS1 just can't go next door to @PERSON2's house and ask for toilet paper when I've been sitting anxiously on the toilet with hope @CAPS1 would bring me toilet paper for an hour. Yet, they came to our house and asked for our plunger which is far more embarrassing,"" @PERSON1 said. As soon as those words violently came out of his mouth we started cracking up laughing. It felt like my stomach was tightening so much that I couldn't breathe. With as much attitude as @CAPS1 can put in your tone of voice, @ORGANIZATION1 had said, ""@CAPS1 don't need toilet paper to clean yourself with! @CAPS1 could have easily hopped in the shower and used the shower head to wash off the poop!"" @CAPS2 that point @CAPS3 was no going back @CAPS2 what she had said. My step dad was furious that she would even say such a thing. Without any hesitation @CAPS6 quickly picked up the phone and dialed my mothers number. Waiting, and waiting for her to pick up. Suddenly, @LOCATION1 and I heard a voice on the phone. @PERSON1 began screaming telling my mom about the situation. It got to a point where @CAPS6 said some words that @CAPS6 shouldn't have said. As the words rolled off his tongue @CAPS6 began to stutter. @CAPS6 spoke, ""@CAPS3 was no toilet paper and @ORGANIZATION1 wouldn't go and grab me some from @PERSON2's house. Unfortunately, I had to get up, get my hand wet, and wash my hands after I wiped my butt with my own hand."" @CAPS3 was no stopping us from laughing as hard as we could. I had never heard of something so disgusting that made me want to throw up all over our leather couches.  @CAPS6 was so anxious to take my sister's phone away that @CAPS6 immediately asked for it before confronting my mother about it. @CAPS6 didn't care even if my mom told him that @CAPS6 couldn't take it away. @CAPS6 wanted possession of it so @CAPS6 knew how my sister would feel. Not only did @CAPS6 take away her phone, but @CAPS6 took away her right to use toilet paper after using the bathroom. I don't know how long I laughed over that, but it felt like I was going to pee all over myself. As @LOCATION1 and I continued laughing @CAPS6 ran up the stairs as fast as @CAPS6 could rummaging through all the bathrooms in our house to get every last little square of toilet paper @CAPS3 was. Sad part was @CAPS6 even took off the shower head so that my sister wouldn't be able to use that also to clean herself. My mother got home and @CAPS3 was nothing to say. @CAPS6 was so embarrassed that we had heard that @CAPS6 had wiped his butt with his hand. Not only that, but i had put the story as my status on @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 had saw. I didn't mention any names besides @LOCATION1 and I's, but the fact @CAPS6 knew the story was about him made his cheeks turn as red as a cherry.  @PERSON1 began to wonder. My sister had said @CAPS3 was no toilet paper and when @CAPS6 asked if @CAPS3 was napkins she also said, ""no."" @CAPS6 started looking through cabinets and soon found napkins. @CAPS6 was so mad, but @CAPS2 the same time laughing really hard. @CAPS6 felt like @CAPS6 should look for the brighter side of the situation. A week has gone by and my step dad, @PERSON1 still hasn't put one roll of toilet paper in the bathroom. @CAPS6 said, ""@CAPS1 @MONTH1 think it's funny when it happens to me, but it'll be funny when @CAPS1 don't have any toilet paper."""	24	20		44				5	4	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4
