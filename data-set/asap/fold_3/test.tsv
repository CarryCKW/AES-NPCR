5	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, I know having computers has a positive effect on people. The computers connect families, contain information which is great for peoples education, and are very conveint. Computors are a step into the future and we should take advantage of it. First off the internet or e-mail will help family members connect. My family, which lives @NUM1 hours away by car, love to talk with me by e-mail. This helps me connect with my family and is just another reason why we should have computors. Another reason that includes family is when the family is just sitting around and are calling everywhere just to find a board game, it would just be easier to go online to find it. This way it would be quick and easy to find that one board game. The last reason why a computer would help a family is if a family wants to get in to any kinds of activities and they need the number they could just go online. On the internet the family could find the numbers, the and some information about it. This way more and more families can do activities together. As one can see the computer is bringing more and more families together. An other reason why the computers are good for society is educations. With information at the tip of your fingers more and more people will want to learn. Now a days people try to find the out, but will all the tools on the computers mae people get the education. Secondly computers are another way to go to collage. If you arn't up to going to school/collage because your sick. You wouldn't have to miss anything because with a click of a button you will have the materials needed for what was missed. Lastly everyone knows that in @LOCATION2 most classrooms can't afford one computer. The children want computors so hard. If they were to get one it would change so much. They would be able to learn so much more than before. The children could lean about different countries far away. As a result computers would improve the way we learn. The last reason why computers are so helpful is convience. Now a say the world is crazy, so if we don't have to go out or talk to someone we won't. The computer will offer the ability to confrence will other people so that there would be communication between work parttners. With the ability to talk with another for work would make us a lighter nation. This is only one of the many reasons computers are very conviente, subssiquently computers are conviente because you could book flights, vacations, rentals, and much more. With a click of a button you should be going to @CAPS1 or a nice vacation."	4	4		8																					
8	1	"@PERCENT1 of people agree that computers make life less complicated. I also agree with this. Using computers teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and lets people talk online with other people. I think that these are all very important. Why wouldn't you want to have strong hand-eye coordination? I think this a very important skill. Computers help teach hand-eye coordination and they keep it strong. While you're looking at the screen your hand is moving the mouse where you want it to go. Good hand-eye coordination is used for a lot of things; mostly everything. If you play some sports like baseball, hand-eye is one of the most important elements. Why not make that stronger off of the feild? Also, hand-eye can be used to @ORGANIZATION1 while taking notes. Hand-eye is involved with almost everything you do. you can't have a poor hand-eye coordination or else you won't be able to function properly. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 doctors agree that hand-eye very important for healthy living. "I love to travel, but I want to know about the place I'm going to before I get on the phone to go there." said @PERSON1, a science teacher at @ORGANIZATION1. He feels the way, I'm sure, a lot of people feel. They want to know about the place they are going to and they want it to be current. The computer has plenty information about a lot of different places in the world. Some books don't offer as much information or they need to be updated. Computers are also very good for learning about other cultures and traditions. No one wants to be ignorant right? People want to know what's going on in the world quick and easy. The computer does this. I remember when I was about @NUM2, our phone broke in our house. We couldn't go out and get one right away either. The only way we were able to communicate with our family and friends was by computer. The computer made it easier to e-mail everyone and tell them why we weren't answering our house phone. This happens more often than you think. People need to communicate through computer a lot. At work, if you need to talk to an employee or co-worker and you can't leave your desk, you can just e-mail the information to them. @NUM4 out of @NUM2 employees say that it is much faster and easier to e-mail information as opposed to talking them on the phone or in person. A lot of people agree that computer make life a lot easier. Computers teach hand-eye coordination and they let you communicate with other people. The most critical reason is that computers let people learn about faraway places and people. You can make a difference in the way people feel about computers. Write to your local newspaper. It's now or never!"	5	5		10																					
15	1	"Dear, In this world today we should have everyone useing computers. Computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Today computers are like the worlds biggest book of knowledge. everything you need to know is in a computer. You can look up faraway places, and zap theres everything you need to know write in front of you. Computers are fast and easy, everyone can use them. Today kids are so addicted to computers everyday they are on them. There are so many websites that kids and teens go on, like @CAPS1, and facebook ect. on these websites kids as young as ten years old are chatting with friends and putting up pictures. Thers is also webchat websites that allow you to use a webcame and talk to people anywhere in the world. Computers are a great way to get in touch with people. Everyone should have a computer in there home today."	3	3		6

24	1	"Dear local newspaper, I've heard that not many people think computers benefit society. I disagree with that. Computers benefit society by teaching hand-eye coordination, allowing people to learn about foregin places, and allow people to communicate with others online. Some people were basically born with hand-eye coordination, but most people weren't, like me, for example. But, thanks to computers, my hand-eye coordination has gone up! ""On average, computers can increase a persons hand-eye coordination by up to @PERCENT1 says @PERSON2. Think of it, just by learning to tye, your hand-eye coordination can go up @PERCENT1.! That's amazing! Having good hand-eye coordination will get you far in life, and helps with small, everyday things such as playing an instrument, or doing household chores. It also helps in sports. You need good hand-eye coordination to throw, catch, and aim. If more people spend more time on the computer, then the population's hand-eye coordination would increase, and who wouldn't want thats. Have you ever heard of @LOCATION1? It is a country in @LOCATION2 that no one really knows much about. By looking it up on the computer, you can become an expert on the country! The computer gives us access to a lot of knowledge, and will make us more of people around the world. This can improve our travel. Instead of going to the same place every vacation, you can go to a place you saw online that looks just as exciting. Also, by learning about other countries and the people in them, we gain respect for them. We @MONTH1 also learn about their traditions, and culture. ""The internet gives us access to the world,"" says @PERSON1, ""we can learn so many new things that will make us more of people, countries, and the environment."" @CAPS1 is right, we can also be aware of the environment. Since global warming is a problem, we can learn how o preserve foreign places by learning about them on the internet. With a click of a mouse you can virtually have the whose world at your fingertips! In a recent study @PERCENT2 of people said they don't have time to meet with old friends. The internet, however has made it quick and easy to talk to people online. Websites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 can keep your social life in tact, and can even reunite yu with old friends. For example, @CAPS2 suggest family. You can keep in touch wih many people trough @CAPS2! Also, you can make new friends. Most teens say they are always willing to meet new people, and the internet is a great way to do so! Sites like @CAPS7, and @CAPS8 can can help you find friends by connecting you in a chat room to a random person, just to talk. I once talked with someone on @CAPS7 for over an hour! We found that we both have @CAPS4 accounts and keep in touch there! This also helps you gain confidence because you @MONTH1 have the courage to say something over the computer that you would't say real life. The computer can really amp up your social life. As you can see. computers don't just ""your barain,"" they imprdove hand-eye coordination, help you learn about far away places, and improve your social life by allowing you to talk to others. Computers benefit the society more than anymore will ever know!"	6	5		11																					
29	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 people throughout the world use, or own computers. Although there are @CAPS1 people who think computers are good for you, others could say different. While you are on the computer you can become more socal by talking with friends or family. Also, while you are on the computer you @MONTH1 not notice it but; your hand-eye coordination is improving, and finally, you are able to search with a click of a button, instead of searching your topic through dozens of books. Computers have very @CAPS1 benefits. One being chating, or talking online to friends, and family. You @MONTH1 have a distant friend that you haven't talked to in a while. With a computre you are able to re connect with your buddy. If you have an acount that is safe to chat on, you @MONTH1 be able to make new friends. That would be good for you, socally. It is always good to have friends, and stay in touch with family. Some people find it hard to play a piano because they cannot look at the music and have their hands be doing something else. On a computre your hand-eye-coordination improves over time because, you are searching a topic as your hands are typing. Also, this is a great memory excirsise for your fingers. You eventually memorize where all of the keys are located. People without computres have to search through @CAPS1 books to find information on their topic. Others with computers, just have to type in their topic and all the information they need is right infront of them. You are able to see pictures of your topic or even video's! Not @CAPS1 books that I know, can search a topic, show you pictures, and videos of it with one resource! @CAPS1 people debate the fact if computres are good for you or not. If you ask me, computres are great for people. It allows people to be socal, and talk to old friends; it also improves your hand-eye coordination, and finally; it gives you the option to search a topic without all the hastle of searching through dozens of books. So now the question is up to you; are computers good for people, or not?"	5	4		9																					
30	1	"Dear Newspaper People, I think that computers do benefit society for a few reasons. Computers make work easier they can do things people can't like solve difficult problems, and kids like playing games on them. Computers make work easier and neater. Typing is often faster than writing, and is always easier to read. Studies have also shown that people who use computers to do work finish faster and have up to @PERCENT1 more free time to do whatever they want. Computers also have e-mail, which allows you to send work that you have done to your boss without printing it and wasting paper. Computers can solve difficult problems that people either can't do, or don't want to waste their time doing. If you need to solve a math problem you use a calculated or a computer. So you don't have to figure it out yourself. I have to do a lot of math problems for homework and I think it is much easier to use a calculator. My last reason why computers are good is that kids like playing games on them. A lot of people say that kids shouldn't play computer games but some of them are educational. Even non-educational games help kids to have fun and have something to look forward to after their work is done. @PERCENT2 of kids say that they are happier when they have something fun to look forward to, and happier kids do better work. I hope that after reading this you will understand how much computers contribute to society."	4	4		8																					
32	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1 and I am a @ORGANIZATION1 citizen. I believe that computers do NOT benefit society of all! In @CAPS1 opinion, they make our town worse. People spend way too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. All of these things are @CAPS3 computers are doing to our society and it's time to make a stop to it! First of all, people are on the computer way too much. Teens are on social networking sites, adults are on chatrooms, and kids are playing computer games. Instead of that, people should be playing outside, or going for a walk in the park. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of adults are overweight? If people cut back the amount of time indoors, we could probably bring that number way down. Also, who knows @CAPS3 teens are doing on the computer. Computers have good things but they can also be bad. For example, chatrooms who knows @CAPS3 kind of people are in chatrooms. Children need to be careful about @CAPS3 they say or show on the internet. Instead of playing games or talking to their boyfriends and girlfriends, teens should go outside and exercise. Second, more citizens need to enjoy nature and the beautiful senery around them. Were all so busy running to check our e-mail, we don't notice @CAPS3 a beautiful day it is outside. On a nice @DATE1 or @DATE2 day, people should take this kids to a local park or pond. This reminds me of last @DATE2 when I went to @CAPS1 cousins house. @CAPS1 aunt only allowed us to watch one hour as a day, that included the computer. We were outside every single day, even if we were just staring into the clouds. This kept us active and enjoy the environment. @CAPS1 last reason why computers are badly affecting society is that computers take time away from interacting with family and friends. I know @CAPS3 your thinking, when your on the computer you are talking to family and friends, but it isn't the same. Instead of instant messaging call them. Maybe even invite them our to talk face to face. That reminds me of @CAPS1 sister. When I get home, she will normally be on @CAPS2. Now, instead of getting up and coming to talk to me she will text me ""@CAPS3's up?"" or ""@CAPS4 was your day?"" Computers help people communicate, but they also take communication away. As you can see, I have given you three reasons why I strongly believe computers are badly @ORGANIZATION1. Not only @ORGANIZATION1 but everywhere! You need to open your eyes and understand that people spend way too much time on computers, they allow people to not enjoy nature, or interact with their families. Please I'm asking you to understand that our society will crash it we don't fix this issue. So @CAPS3 are you going to do about it?"	5	5		10																					
34	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 is a rumor going around saying that computers are a negitive affect in a childs life. I disagree. A computer can help a kid in so many ways, it can help students with homework, let students talk to friends, and help with school projects. And besides, most kids don't don't stay on the computer very long anyways. Homeworks, it's a big role in school, if you don't do it or worse don't get it can you down. That's why computers have websites that help a child learn how do do a problem or a social studies question if they don't know. If you go to the school web page then theres a link that brings you in a math games. Theres even a to a science website. This helps a child so they don't get stressed out over homework. A computer also helps a students interact with friends. A social life is very important to a @NUM1 grater. This is where a computer can have aim, facebook, and even myspace help a kid impact with friends. If a kid got into a fight at school can come home and to work it out and not leave it unseatled. A computer also new friends from other towns. Teens need to and make new friesnd will helps as in life. If a teen helps with a then they can ask a for help. Every student gets a take home project at social point in the time of running out to the store to buy paper and pencils. you can stay home, have money and typee the essay. Computers can help with a social studies or a science project. You can print pictures and find information. Drawing can be a hastle and messy, so it saves time and the mess. If @CAPS1 are words you dont understandd then you can look them out. Computers are and best way to do a project. Computers, everyone uses them, they help our parents just as much as uss. They help us with homework, let us talk to friends, and even help us do our projects! Computers are one of the best technology we have @DATE1."	4	4		8																					
37	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has been brought to my attention that some people feel that computers are bad for us. Some people say that they are a distraction to our physicaland mental health. Although I can see how some people would think this, I believe that computers are a good benifit to all society. I believe this because computers can help people learn, stay intach with friends or family that live faraway, and stay orginized. Sometimes people are on the computer, learning and they don't even know @CAPS1. Simply by visiting the @ORGANIZATION2 homepage, you automaticly see the news feeds of things happening around the world. Other times people go online diliberatly to learn. If someone is thinking about going to @LOCATION1 then they would probably go on the internet to learn about @CAPS1. Simply by searching equadore many choices will pop up you climate, sesonal weather, hotel options, and other farts. But thats not the only way people are learning on the internet. Now, many college students have the option of taking their lessons online. This is because some students like calm quietness or own house the distractions of sitting in class. Friends could be a big distraction in class, but how can you stay intouch with your friends if they moved away? I remember in second grade my bestfriend, @LOCATION2, move away. I was so sad. I badey ever talked to her, but then one day our parents set us up on a vidio chat! I felt like I was right their with her! This was great, and I though about how many people could use this to talk to relatives or friends. Another great way to stay intouch into friends and family is through e-mail. By writing a message and sending @CAPS1 can make staying in touch so easey, and your personal wants can chat and emails are a easey thing to send world wide. So many people love to type on a keyboard as well, but so many different papers that you type could be lost. I, for me, hate clutter, and I have so many school binders for papers to be lost in. This is why I take great advantage of typing my paper every chance I get. My computer keeps me orginiced because I could never loose my work. File save, is an idiot proof way to keep all your files in a safe place. Then all you have to do is press print to get a hard copy. I am sure that many people love using their computer for the same reason. Also, I myself am a much faster typer than I am writer so my work is a lot needey on the computer. As you can see their are plenty of reasons why using a computer is goof for our society you can learn, stay intouch with friends and family, and stay orginiced. Many people, could agree with me. Don't you?"	6	6		12																					
39	1	"Dear local Newspaper A lot more people uses computers daily but not everyone agrees that it benefits society. Those people who supports advsnces in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on the people and I agree on some circumstances but looking at the situation cleary I dont agree due to the fact that its better not spending to much time on the computers. First because its way better excercising, @CAPS1 enjoying nature and lastly interacting with family. @CAPS2 why I dont agree that people should be in ther computer more their doing things better in life. First, becacuse it's useful to exercise. Talking a walk around the nieghborhood of just going for a hike with people you know. Even better going to the gym its such a better way to spend your evening instead sitting infront of a computer doing nothing but to look at a screen all day and plus exercising makes you stay in perfect fit, healthy and strong for as long as you live. A computer can just kill you not in reality but sitting all day only on the computer eating when you feel like it and no exercise that is whats going to kill you and make you become so lazy to do nothing. I know nobody would want that for sure. @CAPS1, enjoy nature live life the way it needs to. Gods creations of nature is the must beautiful thing in this world dont let it go all to waist. Jump off a waterfall or go to the park let the wind hit your face. Make imaginations become real and just enjoy what natures about. Third and last, interact with your family and friends. Spend time with them and watch movies or any sports channels. Go with them for some ice cream. Dont let them feel left out or unloved. The mall is a great way to spend time with your friends or family also going to water parks like six flag or lake compound of place like nomads or chuckie cheese its a great way places to spend and interact with your family and friends it also can bring closer as well. This is why I think sitting infront of a computer screen all day, first its a waist of time when you go do some exercise or @CAPS1 enjoy nature or lastly interact with your family and friends, @CAPS2 why sitting infront of a computer as a waist of time and negative why to spend your days of living life. Technology holds you back from the real things in life. Thank you for reading my letter and hope you take it in consideration. Good day!"	5	5		10																					
43	1	"The effect of people using computers isn't anything bad couse you learn a lot from it. In some ways when you use the computer and you type, the typing exercises your fingers. Your fingers will get muscle and will teach you to remember where to type without looking down on the keyboard. People sometimes using computer is good because if your writing letters you don't have to use pencil you can just type it and print. The typing does all the work for you so you won't spend hours writing to someone. Computers are helpful to people for example, ir your researching about @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1 you can find almost all the information on the computer in a instant click. Computers save time and does a lot of work. Computers are helpful piece of technology and one of the best."	3	3		6																					
47	1	"Dear newspaper, I feel as though internet or computers act as an advantage in sosiety rather than a problem. They help with school work, like projects or email. You can even take college online now! People also use the internet for media or to simply catch up with friends. One of the most important reasons to have a computer is for school orenented reasons. Like having a project that you need to get notes for or making a power poin presentation. One other great reson is for the teachers. There computers can help them teach a class in a way that is both fun and easy to undersand. The new uprizing in computer use has brought about new ways of getting a college degree. Now you even just simply get in bed turn on your lap top and take college classes right on your computer! I dont know about you guy's but I'd much rather take college in the own comfort of my home then drive to a campus all the time. Another great use for the internet is e-mail to e-mail makes our lives a lot easier now that more people use it. It can send us school starts like a early dismiste or a way to catch up with old highschool frends. Another great reson for the internet is for mention or just to have fun and relax. @PERCENT1 of people that have computers use them for media or fun reasons, like gamelry, or to go on to youtube. Please add this article into your news paper so that the computer can be put out there as a helping add, and not something that is going to make the whole world obise because thats not just from computers. Its the people who use computers, felt that they dont get exercise not the computers. So why put them out in a bad way."	4	4		8																					
53	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, To begin, I understand that people don't like computers because they are over used. If the computers are so bad then they shouldn't be used, but how I see it is that they also bring more good than bad. These points to computer wellfare are they bring sourses, their is interaction between people, and computers are going to advance more over time. Even though these people think they are overused they still use them. So, even I use the computer a lot, but it could be used for good. First and foremost, these computers can get sources online that can't be found in books. Their are search engines that you can find your topics on. Then, when you find your source it has info that could have been skipped over. They can show the other side of they story that they didn't say in the book. your projects that you used to have to go to the library for you now can do from home, that itself is a step that you aren't considering. For instance if people are on a lot @PERCENT1 of the time is research. Furthermore, people can interact with friends over the computer. They can talk, send pictures, or play games. For example, i play xbox and I talk to my friends over that a lot of the time. Even a video game is fun as being with them, quoted from @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ""I have a computer not for friends, but for work"". This shows that even large important still use it for work. people say using a computer is like learning to ride a bike. My mom told me a story that she met my dad because he fixed her computer at her job. So, I am here with my parents because of a computer. None the less, the computers are at their begining and they will further improve. So people that are on have a reason for why they are on the computer. This advancement is going to advance again and again so there won't be a way to stop it thus, people will be on it only more and more so there is no chance of stopping the outbreak of computers. Then you will try to stop them with ""computers eat your brain"". We all know that is garbage. To conclude, I implore you not to try and change the habits of others. I @CAPS3 that if people want to use computer they can. I say this with the sources, the friends and the advanement."	4	4		8

My first reason why people need to stop spending time on computers is, you don't want to always say to your on your honeymoon ""we could to @LOCATION1 from our computer. And your life will go by fast and you want notice it, your all fat and old. Also @PERCENT1 of people who use computers are over weight because they don't exercis.

I think using computers can help you learn new things and meet new people. Slick, slack, slick, thats the sound of people typing ont he computer and meeting new friends and having a good time. When you learn something new like a rat is as big as a house. You get excited and feel your the smartest person in the world. I dont think its a bad idea to use computers because some peole who have jobs work on computers all day. I think people who uses computers all day while the're at work dont have to be classy, topuler or trendy, they just working to help themselves and theior family.

Also, it helps you meet new friends and to keep in touch with them in the long run. Finally the computer technologies is outstanding cause it allows you to chat with family memebers across state through video chat or even websites such as myspace, facebook and twitter. Secondly, @ORGANIZATION1 is a great way to learn about history. You can find history on almost everything from the past to the present. You can learn history about famous people places and events.

Finally, computer is a great way to keep busy because you take the time looking up information for school projects. Also, you can spent your spare time playing games that help you learn or even book flight ticket for vacation.

69	1	"Some people think it is a good idea and same do not. My opinion is that, I think that people spend a lot of time for good reasons. Here are three reasons why, @NUM1. grownups working, @NUM2. students learning how to type, and @NUM3. communicating with others. My first reason is that parents do a lot of work on computer. For example, they do taxes, paperwork, airline tickets, and the bank. And those are usually all done on the computer so it would be easier if people don't drive. My second reason is students need to learn how to type so they can email or even write on paper. It helps them build learning ability and also, so they can know how to sing the @ORGANIZATION1's. Computers are suppose to be fun for people of any age. My last reason is, communicating with others is a great skill to have so you can talk in person. Computers help because if you mess up of what your trying to say then you could just erase what your trying to say. And in person, you can't. Also you can make plans with one of your friend on something if they live really far or something like that. In my opinion. I think people should be able to go on the computers to do work, playgames, no sites, and many more other things to go on, only if you have a computer at home."	3	4		7																					
70	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 life without computers. There would be no quick access to information, no way to socialize, and no way to keep your health records or other personal information safe. Without this technology where would we be? I believe that the world is benefiting from the advances in technology today. As a student, computers are a crucial element to allow me to get my work done. without the guidance from @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS7, @CAPS4 @CAPS5, or other applications, @CAPS6 woudn't be possible for me to reach my full potential a assignments. How could a student be so certain their grammar is perfect on their homework without asking a teacher? There is a way. It is called @ORGANIZATION2 tools. However, the only way to access this is through a computer or @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS7 @ORGANIZATION2 tools allows you to check your spelling, grammar, and punctuation with just a click of your mouse. Computers are an essential learning tool for school system today. Not only are computers used to educate, but they are helpful in the real world. Many business rely on the work of Computers entirely. In facts, @CAPS8 to @PERSON1 @CAPS9 @ORGANIZATION1, a local business ""@LOCATION1,"" In our job, we continuously we work with. this wouldn't be possible without the effort of our typist on the computer. ""@CAPS6 business and companies around the nation are relying on the advances in technology, why change anything? We should continue to progress in this groth @PERCENT1 of business in @LOCATION1 say they would have to close dawn @CAPS6 not for computers with so many business doing this, our economy would drop. This would not help. We all know computers and other technology are great sources of entertainments. What you @MONTH1 not now, however, is that they supply a great amount of knowledge to the average person. For example, lets say you finished watching a special on the discovery channel about @LOCATION2. You want to know more, so you pull out your iPod touch. All you have to do is log on to the internet and search ""@CAPS11 of @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2"" @CAPS12 seconds, you would have your information. People @MONTH1 not believe so, but it is true that you canlearn a great deal of information from various forms of technology. You can have all the resources you'll ever reed right at your fingertips. Computer supply so much more then just entertainment. All reasonable people would agree advances in technology are extremely helpul to the public. there is so much guidance for our daily lines through computers."	6	6		12																					
71	1	"Computers have helped people tramendisly over the past years. Thanks to computers scientist have found cures for desesse, jobs have become easier . I believe that computers have a baseline effect on people. Because they educate people with their jobs, and give people a chance to talk to people having to pay for anything. If someone to a country that they have they might go on the computer to learn more about that country and their culture. Another thing they might do @CAPS1 go to a website that could help them find affordable . If a child @CAPS1 doing a report about a country in @LOCATION1 thay can go on the computer to find out facts on that country. Computers educate people about about places all over the world, you can go on a website that has videos and written sheet clips about what has been goin on around the world and learn about current events. My grandmother would tell me stories about @CAPS3 @CAPS4 before they had computers, now my dad works on @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and he tells me stories about his day. when you compair the two different decades it saids like computers help out a lot within @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Before computers stores would have to do math in their pad when they were giving change back to people, now people save by punching in the numbers in the computer. I think the computers have helped people with their jobs. When you talk on the phone to someone it costs you money. When you just want to see someone I'l costs you money to get on a phone . with computers you can , or onstant message people with any costs. If you want to see a friend for her @CAPS9 but dont have the money to fly halfway around the world to see her you can vidieo chat with her. Computers help people save money by talking on the computers with friends, family and even co-workers. Computers have been very helpful ever since they were invented. They help people learn about places all over the world and about anything you want to learn about. They also make jobs and work easier and also help people save a lot of money by talking to people on the computers insted of on the phone. Computers have improved demastrecly over the years, the screens use to be so small and you would have to press all these buttons just to open it up and now computers can be as big as a flat @CAPS10 and can turn them on with just a push on a button,, Who knows what computers will be like @NUM1 years from now?"	5	5		10																					
72	1	"Hello, I decided to write in to the paper on the topic of computers, and how they benefit society. Comuters are powerful machines, and can be used completing otherwise menial and boring tasks. They benefit people in many ways, like they are very useful in buissness, helpful in education, and connect friends and family together. Computers are uselful in buissness and are an extremely important tool in a common workplace today, and make work get done much more efficiently than if they didn't have computers. One reason Computers are so useful in the workplace is because computers can storee far more data that can be put on paper. Also, they can do jobs and processes very quickly, which is important in the workplace. They can also be used for sending important information quickly and without much trouble. These are all valid reasons comuters are beneficial in buissness, and help things get done. Computers are important today's schools and educational programs becasue they can help students work in a more efficient fashion. ""@PERCENT1 of all surveyed students said they would rather type a paper for school than write on by hand, and shows that they value them in their education."" said @PERSON2, a professor at @ORGANIZATION1. This shows that Computers are important to students, and are used their benefit. In addition to students writing papers, computers are being used by teachers and school systems for grading, attendance records, and more. The teachers at my school are using @CAPS1 @CAPS2, pieces of hardware that are directly connected to computers, and can be used instead of white @CAPS2, and I see that students are getting more involved in class, and focused, because this computer technology is being used. All of these @CAPS3 are reasons computers are helpful in educational proceeses, and should continue to be used. Many people want to be able talk to there friends and family when they are bored, and because of computers and social networking websites, and instant messaging programs, this is made much easier. ""@PERCENT2 of teens have at least one sacial networking site they visit on a regular basis."" said @PERSON1, a phycologist, who speciaizes in teens, This shows that people use these sites, and that they like them. Families that are separated because one @MONTH1 have moved out of the house recently might want to communicate with one another, and because of computers, they can. There are multiple ways that they could use their computers to keep in touch, like instant messaging systems mentioned before. Being able to communicate with one another makes theses people happy, and benefits society. Overall, being able to communicate through computers is an enjoyable thing for many people, and is important to society today. To conclude, computers contribute to society in ways that make it much better for everyone. Whether it's through helping buissnesses being more efficient, giving students the ability to work faster, and in a way they prefer, or if it's helping people stay in touch, computers are always benefiting society. These machines hardly ever slow people more thant manually doing the work would, and the positive influence they have far outweighs the bad they do."	5	5		10																					
93	1	"Readers of ""@LOCATION2 @CAPS1"" should be well informed of the benifets of computers to society. Not only do they teach hand-eye coordination, but they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and provide a means to easy, online communication. In this day and age, good coordination is esencial to prospering in society. Using computers provides a method of both establishing and improving hand-eye coordination from the comfort of your own household or workplace. Dr. @DR1, of @ORGANIZATION1 medical center, says that a recent study shows @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 computers users have better hand-eye coordination than people who do not operate on a computer regularly. In a local primary school, students have begun to ""@CAPS2 to learn"", a program that promotes quick typing. School officials have seen a dramatic increase in the typing speed of children since the program was started in @DATE1. In this way, the computer provides a secure route to better hand-eye coordination. Even more importantly, the hand-eye coordination gained from using a computer can increase the chances of getting a job involving computer hand-eye coordination as an adult such as the position of a secretary or grafic designer. While hand-eye coordination is a factor of computers that has an extremely positive effect on people, the ability to learn about distant places with the touch of a keyboard is even more benificial towards all users. Website such as google and yahoo can track down millions of results in a matter of seconds if you search the name of a city or country. This can be handy when working on school projects as well; instead of having to lug tens of books home to finish an essay on @LOCATION1, you can simply look up the information on a computer at your house. When summertime comes around, and the last school bell rings, you can instead research faraway places that could turn into vacation spots instead of homework assignments. All of the travel information from plane tickets to the right currency is at your fingertips on a computer. If ""@LOCATION2 @CAPS1"" readers were aware of this, lots of trouble would be prevented and lots of time would be saved. The one component of computers that is used even more than research is online communication. State officials, governers, and even the president can post messages on websites for citizens to view while they check the weather or their email. This is a much easier way to hear goverment statements than waiting through endless commercials to hear speeches on the @CAPS4. Social networking sites are also immensly popular, and on pages like facebook and twitter you can reconnect with people who you don't have the chance to see everyday, or don't lie relative vincinity. If your cousin is going to school abroad, and did not have access to an international phone, you could communicate with them through email on the computer, and it would be as if they never left. It is ridiculous to think that someone could find computers - the gateway to faraway places, good hand-eye coordination, and the connection ten distant friends and family - a concern to society. They help town in countless ways and ""@CAPS5 @CAPS1"" readers should be aware of this."	5	6		11																					
94	1	"Dear Newspaper people, I'm here to tell you that computers have a bad effect on people. The computer @MONTH1 hold lots of information but does it always hold the right information? You could do lots of other stuff than lay on the computer. Also, the computer is very distracting. The computer @MONTH1 give you the wrong info. Instead of going through the process of turning on your computer, search for the info and turn it off takes more time than find a book, open it, find the info close it and put it back. Books more often are correct. Computers take time to find into than a book. Computers give you too much information than a book. There's plenty of other stuff to do than play on the computer. You could read a book or draw. You could also play outside and shoot hoops or ride your bike. You can call up your friends and play with them. If you're really bored and you don't know what to do, make up a game. At times, computers could distract you. If you want to get homework done and you have a computer, it gets you off topic. If you're at work with a computer, it's tempting. Even other people on computers is distracting. if you're working on the computer, it does not take much to to take the thing you need to search like @ORGANIZATION1 and change it to something you want to search like @ORGANIZATION1 company. See what I mean by a negative effect? It doesn't give you the right info always, you could do better things in life and is very distracting. It is what makes the workers to the procrastinators and the fit to the lazy. Computers have entered our world and have altered all of our lives! Computers have made a big change to everyday life. Please agree with me."	4	4		8																					
96	1	"The use of computers is definetly correct. It is helpful, you can discover new things and much more. Computers makes peoples lives just so much simpler. Computers can help people in magnificent ways by looking for things you despretly need. Like if you were a student and you had to write a paper on @PERSON1. The computer has internet and that like billions of facts @PERSON1 and much more information about every thing. It can be helpful also by looking up the wheather, the new, even things that are happening around the world and even answering questions you have. Discovering things on the computer is something that happens every day. For example I read an article about the @CAPS1 and the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 the next day my teachers gave us a pop quiz on that and I got @NUM1. If a computer can get somebad a @NUM1 on their test think of what else it could do for the world. It might even help sae lives. Of course a computer can be helpful. In way like cheeking the score from yesterdays game, see whats going on in your community, watch videoes, hear music, talk to your friends, relatives get information on places, medical stuff. A computer can basicly do every thing from looking up the games scores to saving a life. The use of computers is, obviously the best dicision."	3	4		7																					
106	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial to today's society. Not only do computers help us connect with peopl, but think of how efficiant they can be. And you can't neglect the fact that computers offer a profusion of entertainment. So before you say, ""Computers are ruining our society."", please read my reasons why computers are essential. What is the first thing that comes to mind when I you hear 'computers'. Many people think of the chatrooms and @CAPS2's. Those are two examples of how a computer can bring people together. Imagine you doing a report on life in @LOCATION1. However, all you can find are those generic articles in old books. A simple solution is talking online to an actual person who lives in @LOCATION1. Computers can even help connect family members who live long distances from each other. I know that i would be overflowing with bliss if an aunt or uncle contacted me through '@CAPS3' or e-mail. In addition to connecting with people, computers are very efficiant. As students mature, homework is taken seriously. For instance, one of my friends handed in an essay and our teacher did not accept it. Her penmenship was not legible. Typing homework is an easy alternative to handing in messy, unsophisticated work. The efficiency of a computer is also recognized when trying to accomplish seemingly simple tasks. Just imagine how often you'd get lost without your directions from. Or how much you'd mess up if you didn't print out a recipe for dinner. Most importantly, computers are the virtual gateway to all sorts of entertainment. Whether you like playing computer games or even if shopping for the best deal is you game; a computer will suit you. There are. Thousand of website to visit and even more games just waiting to be played. A computer is anyone's passport to leisure and enjoyments. So you make the choice. Is a computer going to benefit society, or will they have catastrophic results. I urge you to remember; computer are a way to connect with people and they are efficiant. Most of all, remember how much you can achieve with a computer."	5	6		11																					
107	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 your computer ever crashed, and you needed to do a presentation? Well if so, that means you probably had to do your presentation on paper, the old fashioned way. Recently, there @CAPS1 been a debate going on between experts about computers. Some think they make your life more efficient while others think they make you spend too much time on them rather than outdoors. I believe that computers make our lives easier and that the advances in technology have a positive effect on people. I think this because it teaches you skills and updates you on info. around the world, it's efficient for work and helps the environment, and lastly, it let's people stay in touch. Computers have a positive effect on people because it let's family members stay in touch. Emails are an example of this. Instead of mailing a letter, you are electronically sending it. The person recieves it quicker and can answer ina more timely manner. Also, social networking sites help families keep in touch. One example of this is facebook. You can see what the person is doing and chat with them using facebook chat. I relate to this. My cousin lives in @LOCATION2, so I don't see him a lot. Through facebook, we can talk and update each other on our lives. Lastly, you can see pictures of your family. Many families have accounts on photo sharing sites. This enables them to see pictures or recent vacations or sporting events. They can comment and every member of the family can see how everyone looks/changes throughout the year. That is how computers let people stay in touch. Another reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches you skills and updates you on information. Computers teach you hand-eye coordination. When you type with a keyboard, you have to know where each letter is. This makes it possible to lok at the screen to recognize my errors. Hand eye coordination is a good skill for everyone to know. Computers update you on world news. Many homepage on the internet have news engines built into them. These news engines keep people updates on major news events. For example, the war in @LOCATION5, or more recently, the @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION4 earthquakes. Without the internet, we would be very behind on important news updates around the world. My last reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it is efficient for work and they help the environment. Computers help the environment because you are not using as much paper. Throughout the year, @CAPS2 use billions of sheets of paper to write letters. With computers that number goes down into the thousands. Why you @MONTH1 ask? Emails don't recquire paper. They are electronic, which means no paper. They are also environmentally friendly because news paper companies are going out of buisness. Due to online news paper news is becoming less and less popular. Computers are efficient for work because it is so easy to make presentations. There are so many programs to use, that making a big presentation could take minutes. That is why computers make work easy but help the environment at the same time. As you can see, computers have many positive effect on people. They let family members stay in touch, they teach you skills, and they are efficient for work while being environmentally friendly. That is why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Let me ask you this question again. @CAPS1 your computer ever crashed when you needed to do a big project? Now you know that computers make life efficient. What would you do without them? So now it's your turn, go out and buy a computer because you will be thankful you did."	5	5		10																					
113	1	"Dear @CAPS1 paper, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I am writing this letter on the count of the computer issue. @CAPS2 look on this subject is the oppisite. People @MONTH1 spend more time on the computer then exercising, but theycould still be social in chat rooms. People can use laptops out doors. You can spread your imagination with the games you can play. Lets get onto @CAPS2 first point, being social. The experts say that people are spending less time with there friends and family then on the computer. They @MONTH1 be spending less time with there friend and family physicly, but who said there not being social. Theres facebook, @CAPS3, and chat rooms. You can talk to your friend on there so they on being social. Not being physicly social but verbily social. On to @CAPS2 next subject the expert say were not enjoying out doors, but the over looked something here it is. If were not enjoying outdoors then half of amarica would be as plae as can be. Then theres laptops. You can use thoughs out doors. People that have laptops can go outside on a sunny day grab some fruit and relax. You could stay out there till the batterie deis. Then just grab the pluge and keep relaxing its easy. Computers also help your imagination. Some computer games help expand your imagination because when your playing games you think of things that could make the game better. Simulaters help you design or even controll things. Some games allow you design and play as a character you created. They help you jobs that you might be intrested in. For me computer games expanded @CAPS2 drawing. All these thing can be reversed. No one is a robot that repeats what they do over and over again. Humanity has the power to get off the computer, and go outside or be social. As I just proved everything you can physicly you can do on the computer."	4	4		8																					
114	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers do put possitive affect on people and it also teaches us. So I think computers are very important and they are needed in people lives. We learn information about the world and about what is going on. It also helps us comunicate with friends and family. Lastly it can help us gather information for homework and projects. First, while we are on the computer it tells us baout the world and different countries. The computers tell us how the war is and about what the president is doing. The computer also gives us information about local news such as weather, traffic reports and if there has been a crime that has happended. We also can find out about the stockmarket which is very important to many people. Second, the computer gives the ability to talk with friends and family. AIM, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 are all different ways to interact with each other. Also if we didn't hand something in at school we could always just e-mail our teachers the information that they might need by a spacific date, if a student forgets what the homework was we can just ask on the computer. Many people find old friends that they haven't seen in years, and getting to see them again and how their family is, it could make someone feel happy about knowing that their old friend has grown happy. Lastly, if students have project or homework that they need information on the computer could always help. On the computer there is a lot of information about people, places, thing, and anything you want to know. The computer gives you answer to question you @MONTH1 have. You can get pictures and information of the thing you are looking up. It also gives you location and dates of different events that have happened in what you are looking up. Computers are very useful when it comes to sudents education. In conclusion, Computers are a very important part of everyones life. To learn about information that is happening in the world, to talk to friends or family, and to help with school work. Even if people aren't exercising they are increasing their education by finding information. You can still enjoy nature, but not as much as ussuall; you still spend time with family and friends by comunicating on the computer. Computers are one of the gratest inventions, and does have a positive effect on people. "	4	4		8																					
115	1	"Dear Newspaper people, @CAPS1! Isn't computers just swell? I mean why aren't they you can one learn up on your knowledge, two you can play alot of fun games, and last but not least we can talk to our friend. Well I hope you enjoy my essay about the computer world. Have you ever had any diffuclty finding something in a libery? Well forget your libery cards just go on the computer's @CAPS2. On there you can fin what ever your looking for. One time I was doing a project on my favorite rocker @ORGANIZATION1, so my mom told me to check the libery for a book on him but I couldn't find one. So instead I just jumped on my computer but not really jump on @CAPS4 but any way so I went on the @CAPS2 and guess what! I found all I needed to know about him getting me that rocking at on my project. i mean ther's alot more you can learn with the computer like what's going on in the world around us or even learn about little world around us or even learn about little insects to big plants. Well that's what I got for using the @CAPS2 for knowledge. Welcome back! Well now I'm going to tell you about a few games you can play on the computer. The game I'm going to tell you about is my favorite game and @CAPS4's called left @NUM1 dead @NUM2; @CAPS5 you never played the game your probably like that game sound really hard and scary well @CAPS4 is. i'm just kidding @CAPS4 can be hard at first and a little scary but @CAPS4's still fun. Another game I enjoy playing is a online game called, '@PERSON1,"" the game is fun and all but @CAPS4 takes a while to do and kill the fun stuff. For example I'm a lvl. @NUM3 mage and I can take on lvl. @NUM4 @CAPS7 because I can use high leveled spells. but anyways there alot of things to do on a computer. Like me you can kill zombie hared or just do a quest or two, who cares @CAPS4's in you hands have fun. Now the last thing I'm going to tell you about is how you can talk to you friends over the @CAPS2. well like me I moved so I couldn't really hangout with my friends so I got there @CAPS9-mail so now I can talk and see my friends on a webcam. Another good reason to be able to use the @CAPS10 or computer is you can talk to family members who joined the @ORGANIZATION2. My uncle joined the @ORGANIZATION2 and he's going to be leaving soon so I'm to be wanting to see him so I'll see him on webcam or be able to chat with him. Well that my reason why @CAPS4's a good reason to have a computer. One you can use @CAPS4 to learn, two some hard care gaming, and three just talk to friends. Thank you and have a nice day."	5	4		9																					
117	1	"Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1 you think computers are great for everyone? I think computers are one of the greatest inventions ever. What's really great about them is how much you can learn from computers. You can learn hand-eye coordination, learn about faraway places, and talk online to people. Surely, read on to see why computers are very important to us all. Many people think that computers are bad for our mind, but actually they're not. When on computers you can learn hand-eye coordination. You can be able to type well and very fast after a while and improve your eye sight by reading your writing or notes for a paper. Lastly, you can even have fun, relax, and type out your papers for reports. Definitely, read on to see what computers can @CAPS1 too. They're a lot of faraway places that have their own specil way of showing you a great time. On the internet, that have a list of vacation spots or places that grab your attention to visit. They give you details on why to visit it and a fair price. Think about it, would it be cool to visit a great place, like @LOCATION1. Without a doubt, continue reading. Have you ever wanted to play outside but it was raining or your friends were not around. Well, on the computer you can talk online to your friends. You can see how their doing or what their doing and still have a good time. Not to mention, you can even make new friends. Lots of kids and teens go online to make new friends. Surely, you should agree that computers are great. I think computers are very unique and important. That's why so many kids to adults use it the computers so much. They use it to learn hand-eye coordination, learn about faraway places, and talk online to other. Thank you for reading my paper local newspaper."	4	4		8																					
119	1	"Dear People of @LOCATION2, @CAPS1 many hours a day do you spend being active? Now answer me this, @CAPS1 much time do you spend on you computer? To many @CAPS2 today are sitting down in front of a computer, laptop, ecetra, while not enough are lacing up their shoes for a jog. Computers are ruining us, they deter our social skills, damage our health and cause us to be lazy. They are unbenificial to our society. To start with, millions of people sign up for @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and other website like these to reconnect with people. Do you realize what this means? Now no one has to get in a car and go visit any one else. There is no longer a need to interact with other life forms, nor is there a want to. Lets say there's a woman sitting on her couch. All of a sudden her face lights up with the thought of her friend @PERSON1. She gets up to go start the car, but hey eye catches on the computer. She bites her lip, trying to decide wether to go see her, or have an online chat. Feeling lazy, she sits down. Do you really want that happening to everyone? To late it already has. Moving along, i'd like to take a moment to talk about our health. As most of us knows, fresh air is good for us. Imagine this, you're walking through the woods on a trail. The crisp, cool air, tickles you skin, and breathing it in just makes you smile. Your entire body feels energized from the treking. With passels of days like this ahead, you can'@CAPS7 wait. Now imagine this, your sitting in front of a computer, in a hot, stuffy room. You back aches from being in this posistion so long. Plus you think your getting a cold and you have migrane. You'd get off, but you have another app request. You @CAPS6'@CAPS7 feel like moving back to reality which do you prefer? Above and beyond all this, there's exercise to worry about. I mean, when's the last time that you yourself went on a bike ride? I'm sure you know that it's good for your body if you exercise, but your to busy on the computer. I think it's safe to say that half of @LOCATION1 would rather update their @CAPS4 than get up and move. It's crucial to our health that we get active. To sum up, alot of us are pondering wether or not to spend more time on the compuer. Well here's you answer, ""@CAPS6'@CAPS7."" Not enough people are interacting now a days, their spending the best years of their lifes stuffed up in a house, and most importantly, let's face it, their getting fat. Computers are taking over our lives it's now, or never, make the change to a better and more satisying lifestyle. Please @LOCATION1, turn off the computer."	5	5		10																					
123	1	"Every where you look people are using computers. Just about everyone has one. Some say that computers are bad for you but they can really benefit society. Computers are used for research, socializing and almost all of our @CAPS1 work is done on computers. One of the main things that computers provide is research information. If you want to find out anything, you can find it on the internet. It is an efficient way to study or find information for school. Before the internet and computers, it would take weeks to find enough information for a paper or business work. This was because all information was found in books. Books did not always give you the information you needed whatever was written was all you got. Because of saearch engines and websites, you can type in whatever you want to look up. It is much easier to log onto a computer and type in a question than search an entire book to find an answer. Computers are the best way to research a topic. Computers are also used to socialize. You can chat with almost anyone on the internet. Being social is one of the most important parts of life. It has been proven by science that social people live longer than people who never talk to anyone. The person you're talking to phnes only give you audio and that doesn't give you the some thing. video chat can allow you to show someone a picture or an expression. Computers allow you to see people that you can't see otherwise. For example, if you have a relative that lives far way and you cant him or her, you can see them through video that socializing through computers is pne of the best ways to talk to people. Our @CAPS1 is mainly run on computers, without them, it would be very difficult to be aware of an on coming attack or threat. The @CAPS1 uses computers to store thir legal files of court cases laws, etc. It is much easier to transfer files digitally than actually sending a paper copy. The store market is also run on computers. You need them to see how you are doing financially computers are essential to our @CAPS1 and economy. Although some experts say that computers do us no good, computers benefit our society very much. They help us research, socialize and they help our @CAPS1 and economy.

129	1	"Hi! My name is @PERSON1 and I think computers are not bad. I think this because yes, people do play the computer to much, but they can also learn a lot of things. Another reason is that some kids like bullys can stop bulling and spend time on the computer to stay away from stress. You can also talk to your friends and even video chat with them too. Computers can teach you a lot. For example @CAPS1 your computer breaks or has virus you can just figure out the problem by yourself. You can also learn or read the news that your missing. For example you can also ask questions that you don't understand and people would answer your question. In moder afoot kids, teens, and even adult computers to look up things that they don't understand. For example, when I read along a book and read a word that I don't know and read around @CAPS1 I still don't now I would go to @LOCATION1 and find what the words mean. Bullys and other people like street people that have computers should stay on the computer and you can just play games. They can play hitting games, shooting games, and even board games. You can even watch fights @CAPS1 you want. What ever you want you got it. This is a good thing because then no one will get and everyone will be happy. Bullys can also go on the computer to relax and stay away from people that they hate. The computers can make you relax because you don't have to be around people and you can just tell the computer to do what ever you want. Kids, teens, and adult don't have to leave the house justto talk to a friend or two. I said this because most computers hace a microcam and you can comminicate with others. For example my dad is trying to get a computer with a micro-cam so that he can be incontact with my mom, my brother, my sister, and I. He has to get one because the doesn't live with us any more. He had to leave and go back to @LOCATION2. Another example, would be that @CAPS1 one of your friends move far, far away you can just talk to them on the micro-cam or even send message back and forth. So I think computers are not a bad idea or a bad things. I say this because you can learn, stay good, and communicate."	5	5		10																					
133	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of the Newspaper, @CAPS2 is no doubt that computers don'@CAPS6 benefit society. First of all, most people only have a limited amount of time to things. Secondly, many friends would get mad if you can'@CAPS6 see them. Last but not least, you have to watch out for your health. To sum up, computers aren'@CAPS6 always a good thing. From my point of view, time is a big thing. When people get so involved with something, its hard to back away. Thats just like smoking. The nicotine attracks you so once you start, it is very hard to quit. Many lazy people like to put things on hold. In other words, you waste time. The time that you could be spending on homework or even working on a job, your wasting it. Other people know that they need to do something but keep putting it off. For example, you need to paint your house or fix the motor in the car but you keep putting it off. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people do this in @LOCATION1 everyday. As you of all people can see, many @CAPS3 don'@CAPS6 think too much about time. The next big topic is @CAPS4. You and I both know that every one needs a @CAPS5. When you don'@CAPS6 interact with your Friends, your friends might not bother trying to talk to you. The might not even go near you if you forget about them. Pets on the other hand need you. They usually just sleep around the house when they are lonely. I'm sure that you know pets need love and need you to play with them. Parents need to be @CAPS2 for their kids. When you were little, didn'@CAPS6 you need help? I know I did. Thats why parents need to interact a lot. In conclusion, the more you stick with your friends and stay away from the computer the better you will be. That leads us to the next big topic, health. Staying healthy's no joke. If you want to live long and watch you rkids grow up, the healthier you are the hotter you'll be. Everyone needs exercise. Exercise helps prevent against diseases as well as keepin gyou in shape. @NUM3 out of @NUM1 eople are over weight. When you are sitting in front of a computer screenplay games or sending e-mails, that's just as as palying video games on your @CAPS6.V. You know as well as anyone, most video games are not good for you. Last but not least, most people don'@CAPS6 eat healthy when they play video games or go on the computer. You and I both know, a healthy diet and exersice will give you a happy life. From my point of view, computers don'@CAPS6 benefit society. Time is a big thing which many @CAPS3 don'@CAPS6 realize. Secondly, @CAPS4 which everyone needs is another important thing to look into. Last but no least, everyone everywhere needds to stay healthy. For a long happy life. As you can see, many people would be better off without computers!"	5	5		10																					
148	1	"I belive that computers benifit our society for many reasons. Computers have been around for many years now and everywere you go you usualy see one. That must meen people love then. These are so many uses and fun expeirences you can have with a computer. Computers make people happy and that makes for a better society because it is happier. they make people happy because you can play games like tetris, @CAPS1, and even cards. Compuer games make people happy because when ever they are bored and does nothing going on you can hop on the computer and play a game. Some of the awsome games featured on a computer are @CAPS1, cards, pinball and other great game. The computer makes for a happier home because as soon as kids get home from school they use it for games or chat with freinds. Another reason computers benifit society is because you can now pay bills and buy hings from the internet. When you pay bills or buy things over the internet have is no need to go out and waste money on gas so it makes people very happy when hey save money. It also saves on polution because if a car isn't going out there is less so computers are also saving society as well. My last reason that computers benifit society is they can make you smarter and make you do better in school by learning about often people or cultures. For example on my last research project for social studies I used the computer and got an A. this made me happy so in effect it makes society happy. Now you have my reasons why computers benifit the society. They make us happy, made us smarter, and make us a better society for it. I love computers and everybody else should too."	5	4		9																					
154	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers are an extremely useful tool in society. It helps people learn new things about different cultures. Also, it lets you communicate with friends and family through the internet, for example, using facebook or @CAPS1. Finally, it provides an accurate research tool for school projects, or interviews. First, learning about different cultures helps the world stay together. For example, here, we learn @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. Each class teaches us to respect more and more of this culture. However, some people don't have the chance to get this land of education, so they turn to the internet. If the computer didn't exist, we might not know about the lifestyle @NUM1 mi away from us. We wouldn't know if their lifestyles are extremely difficult or luxurious. Also, we wouldn't know if we could help them or not. For example, the earthquake in @LOCATION1 which. It's one step closer to world peace no more war or conflicts. Secondly, the computer helps you communicate to friends and family for in the world. I remember one time I was mailing my family friends who was in @LOCATION2, risking his life. I knew he couldn't come back to town, so I started to email him, and video chat with him. Whenever I saw his face, I knew that everything was okay. I don't know how I would have without the internet. Other ways lived you could as. Also, just communicating with friends! internet sites, like extremely useful. Finally, you use the computer for educational use. For example, research projects, study tools and essays. Whenever that a research is the internet. This extremely reliable and accurate. However that some of the websites are fake, which is easy to great research to use for school projects. Also, I know many teachers in my school have a blog or page where they put their @CAPS4 on, study links, and handouts, just in case we lose them. Whenever there is a test coming up, my @CAPS2 teacher, @CAPS5 would have links on her go to help use study. Also, is another website that helps us study for vocab. It also has many games that and learn our vocab words. As you can see, the computer helps us in our daily use and makes a positive impact on our society. From educational purposes, to learning cultures and socializing with friends it helps us get through life. As very successful newspaper and people, I assume you will understand how much the computer has made a positive effect in society."	6	6		12																					
158	1	"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 some beleive computers do not benefil society, I do. Computers help buisnesses thrive, keep people people aware of what is going on in the world, and allow people to stay in touch with each other. Computers greatly benefit small and large buisnesses across the world. Imagine all the jobs at each buisnesses without a computer. Buisnesses would be unreliable because no instant contact would mean it might take a long time for products to be assembled and shipped. Any buisness owner would cringe at the idea of running of buisness without a computer. When surveyed, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 buisness owners and workers would prefer a computers assistance at work. Almost every modern day buisness relies on at least one computer. For example, companies that mass - produce their products often rely on computers to do jobs more precisely than a worker. Sometimes computer operated robots do dangerous jobs so workers are not at risk. Buisness also need computers to quickly recieve and send information to other buisnesses and people. Buisnesses are not the only need for computers. People use computers as much if not more, than buisnesses. People like you and me use computers to keep in touch with friend and people we know. Thanks to websites like @CAPS2 and e-mail people can easily stay in touch. Families use computers to plan get-togethers. Friends use computers to keep contact after grade school or if they do not live nearby. With computers, anyone that is anywhere can be in constant contact with anyone else. People also like to know news imediately. Without computers it would be alot harder to contact the rest of the world. Imagine a natural disaster accuring and not knowing about it right away. In that case we could not send aid to the area. With the recent earthquakes in @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2. Knowledge about the rest of the world is even more important. Newspapers provide news and information but a day or two late and they often use computers to aquire that information. Eighty-seven percent of scientists agree that recieving information would be a lot harder."	5	4		9

And noteveteing time into school because of computers. These high tech machines should be outlowed and given to only those who truly need them. People spend way to much time on computers. The time people spend on the computer is time they should be exersizing. Computers make people obees studys show that @PERCENT1 of obees americans admit to being adicted to the computer.

169	1	"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, after reading your article about advances in technology, I would like to offer my opinion about this contraversal subject. All around the world, people are using computers to do all sorts of things; weather its for games, the buying and selling of items, talking with people in different countries; the possibilites are endless. This is, however, not nessessarally a good thing. Many people become addicted to computers. Esspecialy adolesents, who enjoy the games that computers offer. From personal experience being addicted to computers, I can honestly say that I was under almost complete control by that computer. My grades started to go down, I stopped interacting with my friends and family, and trouble on things. Many parents watch their children go through this and are sometimes helpless to stop it. This poses a large problem for parents. My word of advice; don't let your children become addicted!"	3	3		6

Coumputrs are also for great for recer antal acitivitys, and they also take your life away. I not talking about a real life @CAPS1 talking about the activitys you do away from home. Now lets see the benifits and problems we come so far on how we handle money. We use to put it in chets and hide them now all we do is click and type in a securty number. people can also invist in items but invisting is tricky you dont always win. You can win small or lose big they say @CAPS2 coumputers today are hd. The screens are made of a liquid crystal fourmula that hardens. The lights in the back pixels do most of the wort to bring stunning graphis to life. On coumputers today people make money by selling graphis they made on coumputers. So this would be another plus on what a coumputor dose to a human. I went to a school to lern how to perduce great graphis. All teens kids and adults have used a coumputer for recerantol acivitys. On todays coumputors you can play games watch videos, and listen on coumputors. People do this to engoy then selfs. Some people ran get in trouble for fooling around on the web. But there is nothing stressed out and just playing some games for a while, personly I like to go on youtube and find funny vidos after school. I use to own a youtube account and get many views. The worst thing about coumpurts is it can ruin plan gobo or somones socal life some people get addicted and cant stop being on the coumputor until it is takin away.

180	1	"In my opinion, having computers is avery nice thing and does good in our society. I think this because of three reasons, @ORGANIZATION2, it allows people to relax and wind down after a long day of work. Second, it allows people to communicate with their friends, @CAPS1, it helps with schoolwork and makes things much easier. These are only a few of the reasons why computers do good in our society. @ORGANIZATION2 off, I'd like to say that after a long day of work, all you want to do is relax. Television gets boring and you just want to sit and play games on the computer. Well, thats a great way of winding down on a rough day. You can go on @CAPS2 and watch funny videos or go on @CAPS3 and on you friends new photo album. Your @ORGANIZATION3 computer is to do many things. There are @CAPS8 many game , such as @CAPS4 come or @CAPS5 cam that can be a lot of fun. Do you see why the computers a good way of calming down? Other than winding you down on a rough day at work, on the computer @CAPS8 allow you to communicate with friends and family. AIM is a good way to talk to friends and plan get together. Or, you can just have simple talk @CAPS3 and @CAPS7 are great websites to keep in touch with old friends of you, @CAPS8 even make new friends. A lot of teenagers and adults have @CAPS3 because it gets. So @CAPS4 that you can't get off it. As you get older, you dont talk to your friends that much and soon you don't have many friends at all. @CAPS3 prevents that so you can always talk to them. You should always keep in touch with friends. Most importantly, you use the computer for school work. Without it you can't get picture off @ORGANIZATION1 or type an essay that due. @CAPS8, you can't search words on @LOCATION1. Some teachers require you to type out essays and other don't. You need a computer if your teacher require you to type things. I go on swifts website to see if i have homework dure and that helps me out a teachers @CAPS8 put extra credit online. All in all computes are good for society. @ORGANIZATION2, you can just calm down and relax. Second, you can talk to old friends and keep in touch with new ones. @CAPS1 and most importantly, it's very useful when it comes to schoolwork and up pictures/ . Now you must understant when i tell you that computers are important and very useful in society."	5	5		10																					
185	1	"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are many people who use computers this advanced technology we have. Lots of people life that we had computers they have lots of benefits that come with having computers. But not everyone agrees with this @CAPS2 are many people who don’t like that people use computers to much it takes away less time from enjoying nature, exerising, and interesting with family and friends. But I think on people with computer such as talking to people who you cant see, looking up information gives people something to do. One of the effects computers have on people is it allows you to talk to people you really dont see. I say this beacause not all your friends go to the same school so you dont see them as much. But they might have email, myspace, and facebook. Surf you cant online. It makes it easier to talk to them instad of driving so you can see them. I think that is @CAPS2 are activities you have to do or other activities, they need to do The second effect computers has on people it allows you to look up information. Think of it have you to do a project and you dont always have enough information on what it is to do it. But if your computer it gives lots of you can find information. I think that computer can help you in that way the endless sites of information and of better. Also the might be times go on a trip and know how much it cost and how long its going to take to set to you destination. Well if you look it upon the computer it will be all their for you to see also where else will you find this information you call to questions when consist go to the website. The third effect computers have on people are it gives you something to do. I say this because not all the time will you me to do something to do. Sometimes you will be bored something to do go on computer. The things you can do like play games. Also watch videos on youtube. For example you funny keeps you laughin add on the computer you watch videos. Another thing you can do is download music to your do you ever have line that think of not busy so do it now. See these @MONTH1 things you can go on the computer. To conclude I think that computers have lots of effects on people. These are about computer how people spend time on them. But I disagree is many good effects computers can have on people. I hope you agree with me. These are the three effects computers has on people allows you look up information, gives you something to do."	4	4		8																					
186	1	"Dear, Newspaper I am writing to persuade to put article in the paper about how computers have bad benefits on people. Computers make you unhealthy, bullying takes place on the computer, and it effects how you do in school. First, computers have bad effects on people because it makes you unhealthy. I say this because most people don't get enough exercise. Then you get obese from not having enoughb exercise. Eventually you @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not get diabetes from being obese, but most of the time you do. The next reason why lcomputer have bad effects is because kids get bullied on the internet. This is important because when kids get bullied the feel bad about themselves. Then they all get very depressed. This is called cyber bullying. One example is, is that a guy came to our school to talk about his son. his son had killed himself from being bullied on the internent and at school. That is why bullying is an important issue and computers have bad effects on people. My third and final reason why computer have bad effects on people is that kids do bad in school. they do bad in school because they spend so much time on the computer that they stop doing their homework and stop preparing for tests and quizzes. Also kids get distracted in school because all they think or care about is going home and going on the computer. Kids also do bad in school because they eventually think that school is a waste of time and drop out. It is a proven fact that @PERCENT1 of kids that have dropped out of school was kids that were always on the computer and they said that school was a waste of time. Thats how a computers have on effect on school. Now remember, computers have bad effects on people because it makes people unhealthy. People gets bullied, and it has on effect on your schoolwork. That is how computers have bad effects on people."	4	4		8																					
194	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you want our society to becaome one of obese, lazy with no appreciation for family or friends? @CAPS2 you want people to lock a respect for nature? This is the result of excessive of computer usage our society will become lazy, and dependent upon robot slaves and loose, brain washed. People will not be caring for family or friends. Most importantly, our society will have no appreciacion or respect for mother nature. Is this the way you wish our world to be? Have you ever read @CAPS3 @NUM1? In the book, the government uses technology to brainwash people and then manipulate them. If our society, like the one in the book, becomes over dependent on computers and technology, then we will collapse from the inside going from a respected world power, to a third world country in. We will need to redesign buildings to have doors big enough for our bodies to fit through. We will not be a respected nation anymore. There will be charities in other countries to send money to build gyms and pools, but nobody will use they. Recent research from @ORGANIZATION1 says that @PERCENT1 of people who spend more than an hour and a half on their computer every day are over @NUM2 pounds. People won't remember how to talk. Babies will learn to type instead of talking or walking. Is this good for our country? People say that the best thing you could ever have is a supportive family and a group of good friends. According to @PERSON1, a well known psychologist, ""People who have more friends have a @PERCENT2 reduced risk of depression."" Friends actually affect you health. People who use the computer too much lose friends and became separated from their families. The mental health effects from this can be horrible, and people sadly will miss out on all the positive parts of life. It's important that people are happy, but if you onlr communicate through e-mail and social networking sites, you aren't social enbough. It is one thing to chat online, but it is better to be able to see someone face to face than a picture on screen. Nobody wants to end up like this, so limit oyur computer usage. With too much computer usage comes a lack of respect for nature, People used to care nature for many reasons, but the biggest is that it affects us everyday, in everything we @CAPS2 and own. Everything has a base in nature, even ourselves. The weather outside even on a beautiful @DATE1 day, can be deadly if we don't pay attention to what is going on outside of our safe house. We depend on nature but if we don't respect her, she will kill us. Anything is good in moderation, even a computer. But when we don't limit ourselves, it has bad consequences. We will no longer have a respected society. Our family and friends will dissapear, causing health problems. Worst of all, we will lose all expectation and respect for mother nature. The time to start limiting computer usage is now, or we will have many great problems."	5	5		10																					
198	1	"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 show that @PERCENT1 of humans in the @LOCATION2 alone spend most of their time on a computer or laptop. I believe that the effect of computers has a negative effect on humans because it creates people to have a lack in exercise and it limits the physical interaction with others. As a nation, we can lower the statistic above and create a better environment altogether. The amount of people that lack a sufficient quantity of exercise has risen in the past decade. Doctor @PERSON1, who is expert in the connections between health and computers, surveyed @NUM1 people. Out of those people, @PERCENT2 said they rarely go outside because theu are trapped in the cyber world. This shocking percent proves that only one in twenty people actually get some tyoe of exercise. @PERSON2 stated, ""this shocking @CAPS2 means that most -if not all- all people are unhealthy physically, which is a problem that must be solved."" @CAPS3 goes on to say that being on a computer for most of the day and not exercising is what contributes ti unhealthiness. In addition to lacking exercise, many humans are losing the physical interaction that they should have. As humans have become, modernized with technology, most humans lose the physical interaction that they world normally have encountered if they we not on the computer. @PERSON3 agreed with this statement and said, "" I am a college greaduate; I have a degree and all, but I wasn't always like this. When I was younger, I owned a computer. As soon as I got home from school, I would always go on the computer. I wouldn't talk to anyone-not even my family! If I could go back and change that, I would."" This statement proves that the lack of physical interaction with human is a crucial subject to touch on. @PERSON3 regreted it all and changed his ways once @CAPS3 got to high school. No one wants to live with regrets, so physical human interactions are necessary to live a non-regretful life. the lack of human interaction and lack of exercise are problems that need to be solved as soon as possible. In conclusion, using computers has started a growing epidemin in the @LOCATION1. The most important reasons as to why computers have anegative effect on humans are it limits the amount of exercise, and it almost destroys the physical interactions between humans. Thank you for your attention, and remeber one thing: Computers can always have a negative effect on many humans lives."	5	5		10																					
204	1	"You want my opinion on the effects computers have on people? Well, I believe that computers help people educate people and some computers people relie on. It's time to decide if you agree with me that computers have positive effects on people. Do you agree with me that computers can help people? Say for example you have a question noone in your home can answer. Why not @ORGANIZATION2 it? Of course once in a while you're going to get a school project. Surely you'll need information, but the library is closed. And you don't @CAPS3 what to do. Simple, all you have to do is reasearch it on your computer. Don't you agree that computers help people? I remember this one time I entered a @CAPS1 contest, and the @CAPS2 I needed was lost, then I remembered I put it in my computer. Computers can be relied on by people. Just think about it! Almost over @PERCENT1 of jobs out in the world relie on the technology of a computer. For example the @ORGANIZATION1 job. It would be kind of hard to keep track of how much trash is thrown out every year without a computer, surely banks use computers too! To keep track of everyone's allowance and money situations. Let's not forget about what lawyers do? There are some lawyers incart who use the computer to type up every word said. They turn the words into short and to keep up with what people are saying. Did you @CAPS3 that without these computers ever half the million jobs in the world would fail? Some people would agree that some online games are educational. For example, there is @CAPS4. That game teaches you words you probably never seen before. And don't forget @CAPS5. That game improves your counting of numbers. Last, but not least would be @CAPS6 @CAPS7. That game sharpens your skill and exercises your brain. Strategy come in handy, surely you now see that some games are very educational. In conclusion, I agree that the effects computers have on people are positive. Because computers help people, are reliable, and can educate people. It's now or never do you agree that computers have positive effects on people?"	5	5		10																					
213	1	"Dear local newspaper, I just wanted to say that I do I agree with you that some people spend a lot of time on the computer. My reasons are that people need to exersize, go out doors. And have fun. If you keep reading you'll understand why they need to do theis things. My first reason was exersizeing. And the reason why I say exersizeing is because you don't need to be on the computer all day long. So many things that they can do, is run, jog, and go for bike rides. I mean it's ok to go on the computer once and a while to learn but that's why they have books, and school to learn about things. My second reason was going out-side and the reason for that is because people need to get fresh air and not be locked inside all day. Another one was to explore and go on a hike to see what is out there and just have a good time. My other reason was nature. And what I mean by that is you can go to the zoo and learn about stuff there to. Another thing is that you can do much more with out being on the computer all day long. My last reason was you can talk to your friend about stuff, you can go to the mall all day, you can also hang out with your friend and have a sleep over and watch movies. You don't need to stay on the computer all day you need to have fun. This is why I say you don't need to be on the computer. You can do other stuff and still learn with-out being on the computer.

Computers impact humans in a harmful manner because people are spending too much @ORGANIZATION1 their quality time on their computers which additionally leads to less time spent doing exercise. People also do not get to spend as much as their days outdoors and interacting with friends and family. Firstly, people are spending too much @ORGANIZATION1 their time surfing the net. Study show that an average @CAPS1 spends in total @NUM1 hours a day on the computer, almost double what they should be spending on it. Dr. @DR1 from the @CAPS1 technology society, says' that if this increases @ORGANIZATION1 time spent on the internet, continues for more years, most @CAPS3 will completly lose contact with family and friends outside @ORGANIZATION1 the social computer network. The average weight @ORGANIZATION1 a @NUM2 year old has increased from @NUM3 pounds in @DATE1, to @NUM4 pounds today. Statistics show that the main caus for this dramatic increase in weight is due to the acessive amount @ORGANIZATION1 time spent on computers in addition @CAPS4 do not have as much time to exercise. Teenagers need to exercise three times a week for thirty minutes each. @CAPS5 the average adolescent only spend ten minutes a week exercising not including gym. All @ORGANIZATION1 these numbers must change and a way to start would be losing the computer because people are spending too much time on them and less time exercising. Secondly, comuters are effecting the people get to go outside and enjoy nature. Form my personal experience nature is a beautiful thing to be apart @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS5 now adays I spend way too much time on social networks such as facebook, my space and @CAPS6 others. How often do you go outside to take a walk, fo for a bike ride or something else? A study done by @PERSON2 shows that the average person living in @LOCATION1 have only spent a total @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM5 days outside in the past two years after reciving their new computer. This must change people need to enjoy what this world has to offer. Thirdly, computers have effected the interaction between family and friends. ""@CAPS6 people hav only been interacting with family at mandatory times such as school meetings."" says @ORGANIZATION1. Family and friends are a major importance in everyones lives. I love to sit down and talk with my mom over a steaming cup @ORGANIZATION1 hot chocolate. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people now a days do not spend anytime with family and @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people use computers to interact with friends. It is vitally important that people stop using computers because ""before you know it you will have lost all communication with family and friends"" says @PERSON1 from I.U.M Computers help people lose communication and interaction with fmily and friends. In conclusion, I urge you to make the right desion by quitting using computers and in return will be a much happier and stronger individual. Computers impact humans in a terrible way because people spend too much time on them leading to a lack in exercise, time spent outside and in addition interaction between friends and family. Sorry about the lack @ORGANIZATION1 organization towards the end, I ran out @ORGANIZATION1 space. Please excuse the mess. Thank you."	5	5		10																					
218	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you @CAPS2 want your kids & citizens to get fat and lazy? Or be active, learn everyday skills and become more friendly to life people around you? @PERCENT1 of parents would agree with me on the second idea over the first one. Well I think after reading this those extra @PERCENT2 will be persuaded. Now a days @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are over weight or obese. This can be causes by lack of exercise and inactivity. Our children need to learn @CAPS1 go out and exercise an hour a day. This could got their eyes off the computer screen. A great way to help encourage to join a sports team or a club. This can work to people away from screens and the @ORGANIZATION2 course. If we can get people out of the office this could even push them towards nature. Their are great things to @CAPS1 at the local park every day. For example you could ride a bike play games or just fool around with friends. Learning could also be a big faster in getting people out of their computer chairs. If they want to look up tell them to use dictionary, theasaurus or a book. If people on the computer but it can be teach kids and drugs. Bt @CAPS1 help find carrer options and life. sitting on front of a screen can your health and also. Their are better things to @CAPS1. Instead via internet. You can still have fun if you not good at just for instance and friends. If your a boy you could just go @CAPS1 like a park and pay carrer base bill or even wrestle. In conclusion I'd say this would want to get up and get outside. Since geting p and side could help you socialize and learn and even loose weight. So now I leave it in the hands of you whether or not to take the challenge. But just to fill you if you stay your computer it can promote the need for glasses obesity."	4	4		8																					
222	1	"Computers and the @CAPS1 have changed the way the world works today. From stocks to instant messaging (@CAPS2) people have based important decisions in their life based on what they have read. Although some people believe that computers are pulling people away from the beauty of nature, relatives, or exersize. I believe that @CAPS11 is only helping the world on a day today basis. One example is conversation, many people have close relatives that but over seas, cross country, or even across town. The @CAPS1 helps them speak to others that they normally couldn't have a conversation with. On several occasions, my family have planned trips together even though we live across the continent. What could have taken months by letters in the mail took as little as one hour to do over the @CAPS1. Another way to speak to friends or family is a website called @CAPS3. @CAPS3 is a website that allows you to speak to, @CAPS6 or send pictures to others. Other websites like this are @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 @PERCENT1 of people in @LOCATION1 have an account on one of these websites. One other way to speak to others, more for business reason, is @CAPS6. Multiple servers proud @CAPS6. such as @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, or @CAPS8. ""@ORGANIZATION3 is my personal favorite' says @PERSON2 @CAPS9 of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS10 newspaper, ""@CAPS11 has helped me endlessly if need to contact someone on short notice."" That is one reason why I support the use of computers. Another reason I support the use of computers is because <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of all students rely on the @CAPS1 for research papers and other assignments. ""Even though I still use books,"" college student, @PERSON1 said.""The @CAPS1 is so much faster and the articles are more up to date. Search @CAPS13 are most popularly used, such as @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS14.com @NUM2, of all computer users with @CAPS1 access have @ORGANIZATION1 at some paint. Another handy program provided by all computer companies is @CAPS15 @CAPS16. This program is used from everything to research papers to. This program also has a spell check, a punctuation check, and a check for mistakes. The main reason I am writing this paper is because experts have been complain that people have been spending too much time on the computer and @CAPS11 has been distracting them from the important things in life. Such as friends, family, and nature. However, from the examples explained in this paper, I have shown that the @CAPS1 increases conversation and curiosity of how the world looks and operates. As for exersise, @CAPS11 is commonsense to spend as little as one hour working on personal fitness."	5	4		9																					
225	1	"Computers, @CAPS1 how far we've come. Computers hold many opertunities for the world and… we don't use any of them. Computers have taken many and left them without excersize. Computers fasinate many and can become very adicting if not used only in moderation. Computers are also attention hogs and take away interaction with family. Imagine seven years of your life sitting in front of a computer. You never get up unless you absolutely need to. You even decide to cut the sports from your life. Now imagine what that does to your body. Even if you ate right, the never excersising part woudl kill you. I remember I was at my cousin @PERSON2's house when she sugested to play the game @CAPS2 fit. If you have never played this before, when you sign in, it does some tests and determines the age of your body. My body was @NUM1 years old. I was a @NUM2 years old in a @NUM1 year old body. All those years gone in front of the computer. I don't want that experience to happen to anouther. Don't make the same mistake as me readers of the @LOCATION1 current. I have a friend name @PERSON1, and she is a computer addict. She would spend days on end on the computer. Sometimes she'd miss school for the computer or come to school just to play on the computer. She'd sometimes get violent when someone tried to pull her away. I hated seeing my friend like this, but mostly I hated how I watched it happen. It started off innocent enough. She enjoyed a certain website on the internet. It would sometimes get scary when she talked to me about it and clearly had played it all night. If you are looking at this story and thinking that would never happen to me, your wrong. I was thinking the same way when I took a look at that website that got her started. Thankfully, I stoped my addiction before it got to serious, but many others like @PERSON1 could and will be absorbed by the computers. Many readers reading this right now, should understand how dangerous and read this is, ""@CAPS3!.... @CAPS3!... I'm talking to you!"" That is the sound of your family members trying to talk to you when your on the computer. It doesn't work, computers are so attention grabbing, you can't even stand to talk to your own family. My mom does this many times a day to grab my attention and ends up calling my cell phone or I.ming me. Thats really just sad. By doing this you also become detatched which is never a good thing. The more and more you ignore your family for the computer the less of a bond you'll have, the less of a life you'll have. Computers truly are amazing, but the loss of excersise is very unhealthy and rapidly happening. Computers can also be dangerous, many people will get addicted. The more you chat on chat room to strangers, the less you will talk to your family. Computers are the devils tools. They will most certainly destroy you, readers. Alway be careful, computers are not as they seem."	6	6		12																					
226	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 out of ten people spend their time on the computers. I believe people should not spend @CAPS3 much time on their computers because it can hurt their eyes. They @MONTH1 watch inappropriate videos or pictures. Lastly, their bills will get higher. Did you know a lot of people spend their time on the computers? Well I think they should not be sitting on their damage their eyes. When you sit and watch computer your eyes starts to hurt. Then when you go to check your eyes, the doctor will probably give a glasses. My second reason is that people go to inappropriate sites and watch inappropriate videos. One time my friend was sitting in the computer and she started to watch inappropriate videos @CAPS3 when her father found out about this, he canceled their internet. Can you imagine the high bills you would get? Why pay too much money for spending @CAPS3 much time in the computer, when you can turn off the computer and spend some time with your friends. For example, instead of sitting on the computer @CAPS3 much, go outside and play soccer, kickball and more. In conclusion, people should stop spendinding @CAPS3 much time on the computers. Computers can hurt your eyes if you sit too much. People @MONTH1 watch inappropriate videos. Also your bills will get higher. It seems to me that people need different activities to get them off the computers. I hope you are agree with my ideas. "	4	4		8																					
231	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people find the clicking and clacking of computers a nuscense. What they don't realize is thay are helping the youths lives and making them easier and they could be doing the same for them. This is why computers have a very good effect on people. First off computers arn't a bad thing if they are just helping people get to know each other better. You always see ad's for dating websites and other things like that. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of couples meet online. Thats a lot and to think they would have never if it wern't for computers. Second of all computers provide a tremendous amount of entertainment. There are over @NUM1 on computer games online. @CAPS2 of them are free too. I bet almost every kids has played a game on the internet before. Think about it your child could be out getting in trouble or be nice and safe at home playing on the computer. You are probably thinking, computers sound so childish and infantile. Well computers arn't just fun and games. They provide a lot of information. They are very useful for teens in school for projects, but they benefit adults in many ways too. It provides information on vacations, hotels, ext. Also computers now have videos all over on how to do things like how to and other useful information. So as you can see computers arn't just a pain. They help bring people together, provide entertainment and have very useful information. Think about it. A computer might save your life one day. Computers help peoples every day lives and they could be helping yours."	4	4		8

246	1	"Dear editor, Have you ever would to know something so badly that you can't focus on anything else? Have you ever tried to find that information and had an""ah-hah!"" moment? What did you use to search for this knowledge? You probably used a computer. All you need to do is type in your request, hit "" enter"" and viola! Your screen fills with choices of information sites. Computers help so many people with everyday questions. Our country has gotten smarter because of computers. You can converse with friends that have moved across the state, country, or even world. At every click of your mouse there are new things to learn. You can even use the computer for your personal enjoyment. Computers have opened up so many opportunities the world needs to lake. When I was four years old, my best friends at the time moved to florida. I was devastaded. At first, we tried writing letters to each ohter. Then, as we grew older and became busier and busier, or connection with each other halted. As technology and computers have advanced, my friend and I text, e-mail, and instant message each other all the time. It has made our long distance friendship easier and closer. Because of computers, you can communicate with friends you thought were long-lost. You can also meet new people with one of the many sites available. How would you like to talk with someone all the way down in @LOCATION2? World communication has also opened up many business opportunities. Since the economy is failing, computers will open job spaces, help college students study for their futur career, and hopefully help to improve the lives of many people. Communication is needed for many things to make our world better for generations to came. Instead of going to a noisy arcade, why not play exciting games right in the privacy of your. Any game you can think can probably be found on the @CAPS1. From a simple game of solitare to an advanced level of shift, games for any age and difficulty level can be found. New, some people @MONTH1 think that all kids are going to do is sit in front of the computer and play games. There are going to be some peole that will refuse to go outside, spend time with their friends or just read outside. There will definitely be some people like that. I can't help it. What we can do is all those that refuse to go outside to do so. I know many people who spend and budget their time wisely and still have a great time. We can also encourage kids to use exercise programs on their computers and video games to improve their health. There are many fun and games that help you to be a better and healthier person while still having fun. The computers we have in our homes right now are equipped with so much information that if you tried to take it all in are you would be overwhelmed. @ORGANIZATION1, a popular search engine, gives you the power to look up anything you could ever wait to know from the vice president's birthday to the price of eggs in @LOCATION4 to how wide the @LOCATION1 is can all be found with the click of a button. this knowledge helps with homework assignments incredibly. Most reference books are out of date and information is inaccurate, but computers are updated so frequently, you have all the facts all the time. I think our country has gotten much smarter because of computers. So whether you want to talk to your long-lost friend in @LOCATION2 or talk to an expert on osprey in @LOCATION3, you can find your answer on the computer. While you're at it, play a couple exciting games and learn about the best movies ever released in @DATE1. Have fun and learn lots!"	5	6		11																					
247	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people are now using computers. However, everyone is entitled to their own opinion about them. Some people don't like them, and then there's people like me who do like them. Computers can let you communicate faster, you can play all sorts of games for @CAPS3, and it provides information. Nine out of ten people love what computers can do for them. Unlike sending and writing letters to people, instant messaging is a much faster and easier way to talk to another person. Sending and receiving letters can take days or weeks, on the other hand, instant messaging takes only a few seconds! Even better, it's @CAPS3! Instant messaging is not the only way you can communicate with friends or family, there is also video chat. Video chat is just like talking on the phone but you can also see the person you're talking to. You can be talking on video chat with someone from another country, and guess what? It's also @CAPS3! When you make long distant calls, it can be very costly, but video chat won't cost a penny out of your pockets! Not only is a computer good for communication, but you can also play fun and entertaining games! Everyone enjoys playing games, whether you're one or eighty-two. There are @CAPS2 websites on the internet and among them there are game sites. Most game sites have virtual games that you can play online for @CAPS3! There's one player, two player, and party . This means you could play alone, with a friend, or the whole family. Everyone on in and have a time. Also, computers could be for fun and your used for work. The @CAPS2 information. It's like your own personal library at home at a touch of a finger! Either you're doing research on a project, , or just want to be informed, the internet can help you with any subject. All you have to do is search the topic you need whether it's cooking a certain dish, learning about space, trying to spell a word, or anything you can think of, and it'll all be there for you, and once again, for @CAPS3! In conclusion, computers are useful for @CAPS2 things and these are just a few examples. I hope you think of computers the way I, and millions of other people, do. As you can see, computers impoved the lives of @CAPS2 human beings."	4	4		8																					
248	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I Computers is a new technology that keeps on getting better and better. It can do many things like help you learn something new and see new/old friends. Even some people do online education. Also what a lot of people like about computers is the games. Computers are a great benifit to us and can be useful and fun. The computer can teach us many new and exciting things. There can be a lot to learn too. Somethings you could learn about on the computer are places, people, animals, plants, food, etc. I have once had to find a recipe for carmel apples and to do so I used the computer. Some people use the computer for there education. There are online college and online high school. Its like a new way to be home schooled. Not everyone can go to big @CAPS1 so it is easier for them to use an online college. Also, lets say your doing a project and you need information instead of rushing to the library you can use the computer and find it. There are many other things you can do on the computer like visit some friends. I friends, everyone has friends either new friends or old friends. Back then before computers if you wanted to talk to your friend you would have had to send a letter. With computer you can now send a letter faster then before. Its now called an email. Which you just type what you want and click..send it off to your friend. Not all use an email, some use instant messaging. An example of that would be aim or meebo. I moved from @LOCATION1 to hear and I have friends I don't get to see much. I bet there are many people that have that same issue. Well with the computer you can now see people! chat and see them. For instance @ORGANIZATION2 is a way to see your friends like that. Its a easy and fun way to stay in touch with friends and even you family. There is still more that a computer can do. Another thing it can do is play video games. They are so much fun to play and what I am talking about is video games. Kids them even teens and adults love. Whenever your bored you can go play online games. Or you can have games you purchesed and play them. They are entertaining and fun too! Even very little kids can play games. Sometimes you can even play with you friends online with a online game. I know when I get bored I go on the computer and play a game called @CAPS2 @NUM1. Computers are great and there are pently of more things you can do other than what I was taking about. I hope I have convinced I or showed you how computers are a benifit to us people."	4	5		9																					
250	1	"I do not believe computers benefit society. Many people spend their life on their computer instead of exercising, going out with friends, or spending time with family. @NUM1? Of @CAPS1 will agree they spend at least @NUM2 hours a day on their computer. Which is unneccessary. Why is there so much obesity in the world nowadays? Because of a lack of @CAPS3. And who is the #@NUM3 cul? Computers of course. In order for more people to maintain healthy, there needs to be a lot of @CAPS3. When someone can sit around all day clicking a mouse or typing keys in, how much @CAPS3 are they really getting? Plus, there are many different disorders in the world. @PERCENT1 inf will agree that with more @CAPS3, these sometimes painful disorders could be avoided. Too many people are choosing their computer overexercise and it them many health problems that could've easily been avoided. Secondly, everyone would agree that friends are essential in life. But now people are talknig to their friends online or in computer games instead of going to the them. Online there is much more which often break up friendship. Also, online you new people or make as many new friends. @CAPS2 you go and have many more friends, which makes life in general much better. Finally, you wouldn't wants families become would you? Well, this is one of the many effects the @CAPS2 members of a family get together which could weaken them as a family. Plus, husbands and wives could not talk very often, often leading in separation or devorce. This could make a child have in decide between a whole family to @CAPS3, friends, and family are essential in life, and computers put those in jeopardy. So take a stand and end this reign for good, stop the use of computers before it is too late."	5	5		10																					
255	1	"Dear Newspaper editor, Computers have been a great advancement in technology, but some people think otherwise. It is a great thing to have some people say but others think it is a hazard to health. I think it is an excellent thing to have. I have come up with @NUM1 reasons to support my opinion. Computers help you keep in touch with distant friends and/or family, they assist you in research, and they even let you do shopping. Firstly, if you have any relatives or friends that live far away computers have websites such as aol or facebook & myspace that you can use to keep in touch with them. Most of them are free to create an account so you don't need to worry about monthly bills for them. So this is a lot better than driving and paying gas for visiting. Computers even have webcams for video chat. With video chat you can see each other & talk at the same time, thats amazing. Secondly, you can search the web for research. If you have a project and you need more information than books give you then just use google or ask.com. You can easily find the details and information you need. All this takes is just a couple minutes, which is alot better than reading for an hour or time. Lastly, if you really want something or need it just shop online. For example if you are a really cool toy that you want to buy for your daughter or son, but its not for sale in stores then buy it off the internet. They even ship your item fast. I like buying off the internet. When I really wanted a bike I saw my mom end up getting it for my birthday. In conclusion, computers are very handy. If you need information, talk to someone, or buy something its got it. I use computers a lot. I think they are very great to have."	4	4		8																					
262	1	"Do you think being able to look up information on anything or talk to people that are for away is ggod? With a computer these are some things that you will be able to do. Being able to talk to anyone that is far away is good. Some people have family in other countries that they have not seen in a long time and with a computer you can talk to them. @CAPS1 the people we have sent to @ORGANIZATION1 they have a Family here and I have heard of them using computers to talk to them because they miss them. Also if you live in an area that gets bad weather and you can not go anywhere a computer can help pass the time, @CAPS1 the people that live in the @CAPS2 they can get alot of snow during the winter time and @MONTH1 have to stay inside. So if they have a computer they are able to do things @CAPS1 play some games or can watch some videos to pass the time. Another thing a computer is good for is that you are able to search for anything. You are able to learn about faraway places even if you have never been there just by looking it up. Some kids do have some trouble with some homework but can use a computer to learn some more about it and hopefully they will now understand how the work is suppose to be done instead of going to the teacher tomorrow and telling them that you did not do it. There are my opinions why a computers have a positive effect on people. By being able to search anything, help children with homework, and pass the time if you have nothing to do."	4	4		8																					
266	1	"Dear Newspaper, I strongly agree that computers have effected people in a very positive way. Since more and more people have been using computers, the technology gets higher and people can acess much more things. Computers are good because they are convinent, and provide entertainment. Have you ever wanted to know what the capital of @LOCATION3 is, or what the weather is in @LOCATION2? To find out these answers, all you have to do is look them up on the computer! The computer is so convient, that whenever you have a question about anything, you can use the computer! Take my cousing courthey, for example, everyday, her teacher asigns definitions for homework. So, she just looks up the definitions on the computer instead of taking the time to find them in the dictionary. However, @PERSON4 isn't the only person who thinks the computer is convinent. When surveyed, @PERCENT1 of people voted that when they have a question about something the computer is the most convinent item to use. Professor @PERSON2, from @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""@CAPS1, since more people are learning how to use the computer, it is becoming more convinent to everyone."" In conclusion, many people rely on the computer for information, and you wouldn't want to take that away from them, would you? It's a @DATE1 @TIME1, and your bored, what do you do? How about go on the computer! The computer is a great source of entertainment. Whether its listening to music, playing games, or talking with friends, you will always have fun on the computer. For example, my neighbor, @PERSON3, comes home after school by herself. She is usually extremely bored, so, she goes on the computer and plays games, and talk with friends. @PERSON3 can also talk to her cousins, @PERSON5 and @PERSON6, that live in @LOCATION1. But, @PERSON3 is not the only one who talks to relatives on the internet. When surveyed, @PERCENT2 of people agreed that they talk to relatives from other places on the computer. Dr. @PERSON1, from @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""The computer is the main source of entertainment for most teens and adults."" @CAPS2, you wouldn't want to take away our main source of enteratinment, would you? After school, many teens and adults go rushing to the computers for all different reasons. But, in conclusion, computers have positively affected all people with their amazing convinence, and great sources of entertainment."	6	5		11																					
272	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I think Computers have a positive effect on people because it helps their education,you can talk to family and friends, and you can get better hand-eye corrdination. Read on to find interesting details about computers and their positive effect. @CAPS4 first reason that computers are positive is that it can help you with your education. I mean come on, how many college students do you see without a laptop? You see none. Am I right? You always need a computer because you have to type eveything, and do research for big essay papers. People think ""we'll, there's always the library?"" @CAPS1 your wrong. @CAPS4 local library closes at @TIME1 pm. I'm sure college students are yo way later than @TIME1 doing homework. Just imagine, late at night, @NUM1 pm, no library, no computer, and a giant essay due tomorrow. What are you going do? @CAPS1, you better get yourself a laptop before the next giant essay comes! @CAPS2, even if you did go to the library, who wants to log all of your books down stairs, and drive to the library and then finally get there and realize you forgot something. Thats just a waste of time! Next, computers are positve because you can talk to your friends and family. For one it saves a load of money because email doesn't cost anything! I have a @ORGANIZATION1! email and I don't pay a cent for it! With a cellphone you have to buy the phone and pay the bill every month. Did you know the average american spends atleast #@NUM2 each month on cellphones? It's out @CAPS2, what if you never see a certain family member? I know @CAPS4 cousin just had a baby and her dad lives in @LOCATION1 @CAPS3. So, she got a webcam, and now everyday they talk, and her dad gets to see the baby. They think the they always talk about everything day, and other things. After, I have just said all these wonderful things, you look someone in the eyes and then than that computer don't help people. For @CAPS4 final reason, computers are positive because you could gain hand-eye corrdination, @CAPS4 brother, @PERSON1, loves, and I mean obssesive love, loves video games. He's addicted to them! He can't stop playing them, and I dont mind at all. I dont mind because now he can chew gum, jotdown ideas for his essay, think about whats he's gonna have for lunch, and play a video game. How's that for multi tasking! @CAPS2, you will be healthier. Think about it, better reflexes, better hand-eye, better and happier doctor! I mean seriously, if you play computer games you can have fun while knowing your going to make your doctor happy. And who do sent want to move your doctor happy! For @CAPS4 conclusion, computers have a positive effecton you because they help your education, talk to your friends and family, and have better hand-eye corrdination. Tell me right now that computer don't help people. I know, you can't because computers help us in so many ways."	5	5		10																					
273	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think that computer have bad effects on people. The first reason why I think this is because people in the world are becoming less healthy kids and adults should stay @CAPS3 more. Kids and parents should only be aloud @NUM1 @CAPS4 on the computer then go outside. Computers are not so bad because @CAPS5 is helpful for looking up information but @CAPS5 is harmful @CAPS5 u abuse @CAPS5 kids play games on the computers and @CAPS5 damages there eyes and @CAPS5 makes them lazy. Also going outside there are lots of things to do instead of talking with your friend on the computer you should call your friend ask him to come over play games outside. @CAPS6 this continues lots of kids will be fit and @CAPS3. The second reason why computers are bad is because of what people past on the computer about other people. Do not ever put something put something bad up on the computer because sometimes they are deep secrets and million of people will see @CAPS5 and that person might be teased and laughed at. And really the computer could do horrible things @CAPS6 you and this person are freinds @CAPS5 could break you guys forever. The final reason why the computer is not good is because people are dieing from overweight there is several teams that are on comercials saying that kids and adults @CAPS7 up and be @CAPS3 @CAPS6 @CAPS5 wernt for theese heros much much more kids would die faster, when kids die they look at whats in side of them and scientest found big fat chunks around the kids heart. Well thats my theory I hope all of you listen to my advice @CAPS7 up shut the computer of and @CAPS7 @CAPS3."	4	4		8

You can make new friends from around the world without leaving your house. You can have a new best friend every day! Not only can you talk to people on computers, they give you better hand eye coordination, and they quicken your raflexes.

I wrote the beginning @ORGANIZATION1 it and my hand started to cramp up. I had in finnish my paper soon so I ran to my computer and typed it in half the time I would've spent writing it. I also got a good hand-eye coordination . Not only do you type on it, you learn on it. @NUM2 out @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM3 computers are used for learning about place and people. Say you just won @NUM1 free tickets to go anywhere in the world with a celebrity at your choosing! With a computer you could research anywhere you want and make that trip the best days @ORGANIZATION1 your life. And even if you don't like actually going to other places, you can virtually go there on a computer. With computers you can see the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION1, the tropical reef fish @ORGANIZATION1 or the @ORGANIZATION2 at the. Computers hold the world at your finger lips. So as you can see computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow people to interact with cites, increase your hand-eye coordination, and allow you to have the world at your fingertips.

277	1	"Dear @LOCATION2 press, I wonder if you know that @PERCENT1 of people out of @NUM1 surveyed by the university out @LOCATION1 agreed that using lap tops and computers had a very good benefit on their life? I agree that computers benefit society and every day lifes. With a computer, you can interact with people all around the world, they can help with school work, and make every day life eaiser. Five years ago I had to move from @LOCATION4 to @LOCATION3. We had to leave all of our family and friends behind. However, with this great tecnology, we could e-mail them. Instant message them, and video chat with them, instead on having to face out money to make long distance calls. Theres many people out their like me. Who have friends and family far away, weather its family in different countries, old school mates and camp friends using a computer is a great way to keep in touch with one another. Using a computer can also more life easier. Moms taking care of their kids might not be able to go to @CAPS1 & @CAPS2 with one kid not wanting to get off his video games, the other watching their favorite @CAPS3 show. Thankfully that man and go online, pick the food that she and the quantity and she can get someone to deliver it. That mother also might not be able to get out and go shopping. So with her computer she can go to her favorite stores website and pick the clothes she wants. And then when @CAPS4 comes, a computer can be great not to worry about not having enough time to go and. A computers just have life that much simpiler!. Statistics how or people help online instant or going in. ""Computers are great, I can homework and know that if they to write planner than they we to and out. If, they can and more of information on the computer from @CAPS5.com, then they could find in their local library. You can find almost anything with search engins on your computer! Some people do disagree with the use of computers, or some also believe that some people abuse the benefit of computers and spend to much time on it and not exercising and enjoying nature enough. This is true, not as long as you stay reasonable with usage or your computer, it benefits you in many ways. Like I said, its great for keeping connections between people, simpling everyday life, and research for school."	4	5		9																					
278	1	"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers effect people in a positive way. Computers increases our knowlage, lets us communicate with our friends and family, teaches us hand-eye coordination, and lets us see our news faster. Computers are enjoyable, great pieces of technology. Even though sitting down looking at your computer screen is not very interactive, computers increase our knowlage. Computers have all these websites that are full of great information. You can look up anything you would like to learn about and find exactly what you want. Going to the library for a book on your report would consume extra time. Instead you can look up the facts you need online. Computers also let us communicate with family and friends. Calling someone or sending a letter costs money, but sending on email to someone does not. Many people have family and friends that live far away from them. Through computers they can talk to them as long as they want at no expense. You can also see each other through a webcam. Which you can attach to your computer if it has not have in one allready. Another reason why computers are useful is because they help with hand-eye coordination. Computers require you to type, which is a great skill. While working out an essay by hand is tiring and boring you can type up the essay on you computer. Typing takes to get good at but is very helpful. Finally Computers help us get our news foster. When major things happen, such as the earthquake in @LOCATION1 it was all over the internet before the news. In conclusion computers are very useful and help us increase our knowlage, communicate with people, help us with hand-eye coordination, and lets us see our news faster. But most importantly computers are fun!"	4	4		8																					
288	1	"Dear newspaper, I think that using your computer too much is bad. Some people spend way too much time on the internet. Many people are too focused on the internet and they lack on their normal activities. Also, the computer is bad for people because they will be on the internet all night and get no sleep. This leaves them exausted for the day ahead. Alot of people spend too much time on the internet. Since they are always on the internet, they don't spend alot of time with their families. This causes the internet addicted person to lose relationships with their family and friends. Not exercizing is a result of this addiction also. For example, my stepbrother is always on the internet now. He doesn't talk to anyone because he is so preoccupied with his game. Another problem people encounter with the internet is being too focused. When you are too focused on the internet, you forget there is a whole world out there that needs your help, most people won't do their choires, or make a meal for their family. These people also have no time for their outdoor activities they used to enjoy. Internet addicts usually don't get any sleep. They have no time to study at night because they spend all their extra time on the internet. During the day, they will be very tired in school or work and the internet will be the one to blame. Last month my mom made a facebook. She is constantly on it. When she is on she ignores everything around her. My mom goes to school and she tells me how she never has time to study because she always on the internet. She also stopped reading the bible in her spare time to go on the internet. The internet is a bad thing to get hooked on. You lose relationships with your friends and family because you never get off the computer. People usually don't exercize or do thier chores. This is not a very good addiction to get into."	4	4		8																					
292	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 the world forty years ago. People would need to travel to visit a library to research, every document, doctors notes, and building plan would have to be written by hand or on an old typewriter. Life would have been much more difficult. Today, computers allow us to communicate with one another, access the millions of websites on the internet and help with school work. Almost everyday, my mon and dad receive friend requests from long lost school friends as well as relatives and current friends. Today's computers allow the world to talk to one another and know what is going on. My dad always says "" @CAPS2 makes the world go round."" With the social networking sites, everyone is receiving tons of @CAPS2 about one another. Another way to communicate is by video chat. All @CAPS3 computers are equipped with a video camera and you can buy one if you have a @CAPS4. This will let you see the person's face are talking to. I have heard many amazing stories about this. One is about a soldier in @LOCATION1 and his present wife back home. The doctors set up a computer equipped with video chat in the operating room and the soldier was, in a way, in two places at once. The man got to see his newborn baby and his wife. Computers can do amazing things! Another reason computers are great is their accessability to the internet. There is this cool website called @CAPS5.Dcotors.Com. If you have an illness or a symtom to something, all you have to do is type it in on the home page and it will list all the possible reasons or outcomes. It also tells you how to treat it and where to find the medicine. If we looked back in time, one would need to travel to a doctor and pay to have your problem checked out. Also computers help out immensely with school work and homework. Many teachers nowadays request or demand students to type their asignments because it is easy to read, and it is easier to correct. I also find it faster to type then print. Say that you need to research the periodic table and write down @NUM1 facts as well as all the elements. There are probably hundreds if not thousands of websites on this subject. All you need to do is type it in on google. You can also add an image by copy and pasting; which will inhance your work. Computers have helped students and teachers. Lastyly, computers (and tehn keyboards) are helping people with hand - eye coordination. Many schools are offering typing classes to try and help students. I recently searched this topic on the internet and it showed a study done by @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 that people who practice typing at least @NUM2 minutes a day, will experience increased hand-eye coordination to @PERCENT1 better. This increase would help many, people with low coordination. Today, computers are helping the world in many ways. From communication, to internet accessability, then to helping hand-eye coordination. The world would change for the worse if computers were abandoned. "	6	5		11																					
295	1	"Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that technologies for kids and adults to use computers. I strongly believe that people have a bad affection people because you addicted, you spend less time with your family and friends. Finally, you spend less time excercising and doing great opportunities for your self. Clearly, i think that lettng students and adults use computers will take over their mind and make them addicted to the computer. This very bad because when your addicted to something, you can go back. This means you will have time for anything. For example, they micht forget what life is about and what was around for us to live in. Addiction is hard to get over , so don;t live your life in a box and play on nonsens live your life to the fullest. Over all, addiction in everything, including computers and a horrible . Without a doubt, spending too much time on computers will rott your brain and make you lazy. Meaning that the less you excersise, the less active you are. This problem is specially for teens. Teens have computer every week. cell phones, ipods, and many more. Alot of teens get cranky and the become node and neisty to their parents because they are testing to. As people dont excercise and move around alot, cause severe consequences like obesity and cancer. Obesity usually happens when you eating food, but it can also ahppen by not eating and not exercising. People that arent moving become lazy and have no desire to do anything which will an effect . Overall computers cause people to do the excercise and less active which will cause . Lastly, Computers make people spend less and less time with their family, and treat their computer as if the computers are . In everyday life , teens on their cell phones , their computers listening to , music . these electronics are causing. If this goes on alot of teens will loose the people they. Computers are a waste of time because they can make you. because they have affect on people who use computers and other electronics. "	5	5		10																					
297	1	"Dear local Newspaper, I assume you've heard about the ongoing debate about computers. I personally believe that computers do benefit society. I believe this because computers benefit by its online, internet, and overall help in other things. My first reason for why you should believe that they benefit society is that computers have online. By online in chat rooms, bank, etc. this helps because people talking to other people online can beast there their morale. it can boest morale in situations like with military officers, soldiers because they don't get to see their family but online can change that in on instant. Online also helps because you can pay bills to gave bank and it overall saves a trip to the bank & a waste of gas. So, online is my for why you, the local newspaper, should agree with me. My second reason is that the internat benifits a lot. The internet, a marvelous created @NUM1 years ago . Its great because you can buy things it, like on a websites such as ebay, amazon, etc. This helps because it also saves time. The internet is great also because with the internet, you can learn of foreign nations. Finally, the internet helps because you can receive news through it. This benefits society because people can instantly hear about natural disasters & problems occuring in the community, rather than hoping to find it in the new or on television. Thats my second reason for why you should agree that computer do help. My final reason for why computers benefit what the help, overall in other situations used later rather thab just the computer. For example one way the computer can help in the future, is that a student can research info a bout a subject online and it can help raise their grade on a project. Stedy has proven that computer training in the , by playing online games with other people, like in call of duty, helps boost soldiers' accorucy. it helps because it boosts their hand-eye coorination & we all increases their accuracy in target shooting @PERCENT1. This @MONTH1 not seem like much but, on the battle field, it can make the difference between life on death. Computers not only help that but they are plentiful & can be used in places such as libraries on internet cafe. That my final reason for why you should go with computers. Some people might believe that computers are bad thing sina they take time away from exercise, but that can easily be solved by using the internet to buy an indoor joggee. Computers benefit society by using online. the internet, and overall help in future situations. There are the reasons for why I believe you should go for the cause of computers. Thank you for taking the time to read my opinion."	4	5		9																					
314	1	"I believe computers aren't having a positive effect on people in this time period for some people they’ve really taken over their lives. There are many health concerns that take place in a generation full of computers. Also there is less time in your schedule for more important things when you're adicted to facebook. Also money will always be less when computers come along! Computers can really be dangerous to you health! For example all that typing can lead to arthritis in the hands and fingers in the long run. Did you know, more seizure are induced by compexors than epileptics? Dr. @LOCATION1 is as saying ""People don't cause obesity, computers do"" @CAPS1 also thinks that the majority of the obeisity is caused by an addiction to computer games. Ever been depressed than taken a long nature walk, and felt great? Well a lot of people tell on rely on thier computer when they're down. Computers usually make things worse. When on twitter, facebook, google and you tube all the time its hard to find time for even the most important things. For example if you're a parent your child might feel abandonned if you start caring about the computer more than very little time spent together could turn them to alchohol or smoking. I let you never of a computer like that! Computer can be good way to wind down but they can also become an addiction there when youre addicted to sitting on a computer you forget about the beauty of nature! Money can also contribute to the addiction. For example shopping addictions are a good way to blow money because it's so easy. All you have to do is type in a credit card number which gives you the illusion that youre not spending money, until the bill comes! Another thing is kids websites like webking which you need to pay for you also need to pay for internet and the electricity bill. It's clear to see that computers cause nothing but health problems, less time in your daily schedule and the money out of you pocket. To me computers are just a trouble in our lives."	5	4		9																					
330	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that there is a big discussion going on about if computers have a possitive effect on people. I believe that computers do not have a possitive effect on people because children on the computers are not safe, they are spending too much time on the computer, and the programs and internet for the computer cost too much money. First, computers have a negative effect on people, including chicken, because computers are not safe. With all this @ORGANIZATION1 technology, child predators can go onto facebook or another website and find out everything about you. This has happend to many people. Some predator went onto my friend @PERSON2's facebook page and found out his birthday, where he lived, and what school he went to. Thiss guy sent @PERSON2 a threat saying that something going to happen to him. Luckily, with the help of police, they were able to find this guy and arrest him before he got to @PERSON2. These days, this is happening all the time. More than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 give all of their information away about it on these websites and child predators have looked at them. @PERSON1 states that ""@CAPS1 this @ORGANIZATION1 technology has helped, but the negativity if has had on society but @DR1 the good the computer is doing."" @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want @CAPS3 to get taken by these child predators who know everything they need to know because of the computer? Another reason why computers have had a negative effect on people is because @CAPS3 are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time doing homework and exercising outside. These @ORGANIZATION1 websites that gives @CAPS3 the ability to talk with friends and play games have made @CAPS3 lazy and addicted to the computer. My friend, when he was little, would play outside for hours and hours at a time. He would play all different kinds of sports with his neighbor. Now @PERSON3 is older and all he does is sit on the computer until his parents have to force him off of the computer for dinner time. @PERSON3's grades have dropped tremendously and he has gotten very chubby compared to what he used to look like. Statistics show that more than @PERCENT2 of @CAPS3 have gained weight due to not exercising and their grades have dropped @NUM1 on @NUM2 grading scale. Dr. @DR1 Much says that, ""@CAPS3 have forgotten the fun in playing outside and lost the determination they had to do well in school. This is all because of these @ORGANIZATION1 computers @CAPS2 @CAPS3 now can go to any website do anything on that website."" @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want your @CAPS3 to gain weight and stop doing well in school? Lastly, computers have had negative effect on society because of money. Many families have spent thousands thousands of dollars on buying the computers and @CAPS1 them fixed. These @ORGANIZATION1 computers are crazy expensive. They range from @MONEY3@NUM3 for a @CAPS4 computer. Then each family had to buy the software and programs to go with the computer. A close family friend of ours just bought a computers. They bought a @CAPS5 that costs @MONEY2, on top of that, they spent @MONEY3 on all the programs they needed for the computer. This family cannot afford this computers but they think that they need one. @CAPS2 they have gone to the college fund for money. Now their kid has to go to a cheap school @CAPS2 their family won't go. Statistics show thas @PERCENT3 of families have waste their college money in computers because the family thinks they need a computer. Dr. @DR2 @CAPS6, ""families do not need computers, yet they waste their college money on them. @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1 do you think that money from a college fund is worth a computer? Computers are not worth @CAPS1 your children at."	6	5		11																					
335	1	"Dear @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 if I was with or aganist people using computers. But I thought about it I decided that i was aganist using computers. For the same reasons, safety stop education, sites that are not appropriate to see. I know many people @MONTH1 think how come using a computer is not safe. Well eventhough you are not talking to someone in person and only on the computer what you do over computer is not safe. The reason why is because most of the time there would be thats thirty and we be like @NUM1, @DATE1 and I use those ages because kids are age be the man one on @CAPS2 myspace, but he can be like thirty and we be like @NUM1 - @DATE1 and us not knowing he comes on myspace or @CAPS2 put another picture up there of young did we start thinking to him meet up and something had happend. For example my friend who was on myspace was talking to a fourty-one year old and then they met up but she did not know his age and she was rapped. Not everybody is true over the computer. Education is very important even for adults and children. Bieng on the computer is not going to bring are education up is going to brings down. The reason why this is most @DATE1 threw @NUM3 come home from school put there hookbag down eat and then do straight on myspace, @CAPS2, @CAPS5 instead of studying, reading, doing their homework. Eventhough those websites do help you learn but only about for myspace, read messages on @CAPS2 look at people comments on @CAPS5. Like for example I would go and instead of me learning new I am bieng and learning new information. Learning brings achievement, a computer brings not succeeding. There is not much I can say about sites thats not appropriate all I can say is watch what you on and see on myspace cause you might just but into something you not suppose to such as raped that went on.

336	1	"Dear @CAPS1, ""@CAPS2 at @CAPS3 killed in a horrific acident"" is the title that flashes across the screen. Then another, and another. What is supposed to be @NUM1 minutes grows into an hour or two that take away from your family. I can see why this @MONTH1 bring up many conflicts; as computers can be very helpful. However, I feel that more often they negatively impact the general public. For one, there are many sites out there that portray false information. Plus, computers begin to consume the rest of peoples' lives. When it comes to these technological devices there are pros but there the cons can easily outweigh them. To start, computers are loaded with viruses, scams and internet predators. So easily someone can steal credit and information by placing offers that seem ""too good to be true."" @CAPS4 you listen to your instincts, then you'll know that they are. But, many people who don't know any better fall for these traps. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people have been scammed some time in their life I can clearly remember when someone. I know thought they were buying a pair of boots. Later That day, they got a call from the credit card company warning them about the purchase. These days you have to be so careful when you're on the computers. When my friends and I were learning about evaluating websites in computer processing class we came upon a site that seemed reliable, and accurate. We were all shocked when we learned that everything about it was fake. Computers can put people who @MONTH1 not know any better at risks. I strongly feel that sites like these and many others have a negative impact on the public. in addition, computers steal much of peoples' time to the point where family, 'doing homework and exercising is limited. I can understand the effects of too much exposure to computers because I see it everyday with my younger brother. Once he begins his video interactive games, homework is pushed a side. The only words from his mouth are, ""@CAPS5, just one more game!"" I suppose you can infer how this turns out: one game, turns two and so on. It isn't only children either. Many of my own friends are update status or pictures on @CAPS6 for three hours every night. Isn't their a point where we can draw the line. between going on for ten minutes and letting the computer control your life? When surveyed ;the majority of students said that they spent at least two hours on the computer every night. When games and instant messaging starts to take away from studying and exercise there is a huge issue. Computers take away peoples' free time and can negatively impact their grades and fitness. So, I ask you to consider the benefits of computers; but also look for the negative effects. You will realize that their are more than you would believe. Support me on this by limiting usage of computers and by helping the public see the dangers that these technological devices @MONTH1 bring. Computers can harm relationships, finances and your personal life more than you would think!"	6	5		11																					
339	1	"Dear @PERSON2, @CAPS1 a “home on your town; all you hear is, “mom, mom , mom drive me to the library to get books”. You see many residents just dying to go to foreign countries but have no money. Is this what you want every home to start looking like? Computers have a great affect on people seeing as it allows people to talk and interact with one another. You can learn about places you’ve always wanted to go to and it is probably the device that makes your life easiest. For these reasons computers are what benefits society most. First of all, computers let friends and family talk without spending a nickel. I know I have relatives who are too poor to pay the high costs of phone bills that come their way when we need to talk this means that not everyone can afford talking on a phone, but a computer costs nothing to use. Also, in the @ORGANIZATION3 issue @NUM1, @DATE1 @NUM2 a recent poll showed that @PERCENT1 of people who own computer use it to talk instead of on a phone. I know some people say that computers are too time consuming, but if this many people use computers to talk, there’s no need to worry about paying phonebills. Also, @PERSON1 a @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION4 says that less people needed a loan when the computer came out with instant messaging and video chatting. This shows that friends and families stopped paying massive phonebills and just talked online. Furthermore, just from using a computer anyone can find facts about lands halfway across the @LOCATION1. What’s more is that they can be in the bedroom or room. A boy name @CAPS3 @PERSON4 who attends @ORGANIZATION1 said that he always wanted to go to when he was little and was as when he looked up @LOCATION2 and facts and pictures on the web. Also, @PERSON3 a teacher at @ORGANIZATION5 @ORGANIZATION1 task a poll asking how many students did projects having to do with foreign countries and @PERCENT2 of them they did. That means that so many people need to resourced foreign countries and need to use a computer to find out about it. It shows that many more use computers to visit faraway lands. Last but not least, computers are just about the convenient thing to have in a recent poll done by @ORGANIZATION2 showed that @PERCENT3 at people would rather have a computer than a car that just shows the important computers are. Also, I used to think computers were bad for you and everything, but when I received one for my @NUM3 birthday, I found out how useful they were. Many people say computers are time comsuming because they haven’t used one yet. Also did you know that million people use a computer that’s more than half their population and such a poor country? That shows her important computers are and how convenient. All and all, now @CAPS1 have if happy residents, laughing on the computer they do because computers allow them to talk with friends learn and visit foreign countries and are so convenient @PERSON2 and readers computers withour a doubt benefit society."	6	5		11																					
341	1	"Did you ever need to know something about another place, or maybe want to see your baby cousin who is not a baby anymore? Having a computer is a huge benefit to society. It not only ables you to find out information, and chat with family and friends but also can teach you hand eye coordination. A computer can tell you just about anything you need to know. This could help you learn about other cultures, places, or something as simple as what is @LOCATION1 creampie. the computer has endless knowledge. This is a huge benifit because a computer is one of the few tools that could help you expand your learning with a click of a button. Having a computer also allows you to talk to family and friends. New computers now have webcams. This benifits you to see and speak to them without having to get on a plane or any long car rides. Which I know is a big benifit for everyone who has relatives that don't live right next door whether it helps your swing in baseball or to catch that touchdown, having a computer is a big help in hand-eye coordination. Believe it or not, having to type a paper for school helps out alot in hand-eye coordination. Having hand-eye coordination can help you out a lot in life whether in activities, school work, or jobs. It is obvious that having a computer is a huge benifit to society by having that ability to learn more, chatting with family and friends, or to help you pass the football with one of your buds. The society today wouldn't be the same without computers."	4	4		8

""@CAPS1 my older sister moved to @CAPS2 it was hard to keep intuch and see eachother, but we found out about @ORGANIZATION1, which is a site where people all over can add people and chat, call, or webcam eachother, so we do that everyday and it's like she never left home."" @PERSON2 says about the internet site @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS4 sure @PERSON2 and a lot of others love their computers.

Even schools took education to the web, with all books from a class avalible at home online. Students can even check grades online now and recieve comment from teachers. So now students are pushed to use the web at home and at school. I hope I have opened your mind a little to understand the internet is not all bad, and people spend so much time on them now because everything has moved to the web like school, stores, food, even tv you name it the web has it. Personaly I spend about an hour or two on the web chating, studying, watching tv. After I might go walk or play my @CAPS5 but i'll still conected to the web because the @CAPS5 picks up on wi-fi connections.

I presume that books are better resources, people can find fun in other ways and that computers can be dangerous and cause health problems. @CAPS1 a well-read newspaper, your stand on this subject will influence the minds @MONEY1 many. I know computers can help find information, but personally, I believe that books are better resources. Anyone can write and post an article on the internet, even if what they are saying is not true at all. People can lie and say they are a doctor in their @NUM1's when they are really a @NUM2 year old working at @ORGANIZATION1. On the computer, you can never be sure who to believe, but with books you know what you're reading is accurate. The information on the computer, (that's true) you can find a book. Sure, the computer @MONTH1 be the quicker or ""easy way @CAPS6 "" in some cases, but maybe what people need is a challenge. It seems that because @MONEY1 the growing technology, every generation gets lazier and lazier, and less and less into books and it's time for that to stop. Also, people can find fun in many other ways not involving a computer. Many people use social networking sites to connect with their friends, such @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, but on those, you can't tell if that person is really who they say they are or not. If you want to talk to your friends, why not call them or more modernly, text them? That way you can be sure @MONEY1 who you are talking to. Too many teens nowadays hide @CAPS6 in their rooms and play games on their computers and spend less and less time with their families. What happend to playing cards and board games with your family? It's much more enjoyable, in my opinion if you play the game for real and not virtually. You can also go outside and get some fresh air, instead @MONEY1 that muggy smell in your room because you're so busy on the computer, you forgot to @CAPS5 the laundry. Plus, if kids have to start handwriting their papers that would improve their handwriting, because they wouldn't get the simplicity @MONEY1 typing. Besides, some kids don't have access to computers, anyways and you have to handwrite your @ORGANIZATION2's, so why not? Lastly computers can be dangerous and/or harmful to health. The use @MONEY1 social networks allows kids to put all their information @CAPS6 there, for anyone to see. This can lead to bad things, like being stalked or kidnapped. The internet also carries many innapropriate images and websites, that youngsters, or anybody, really, should be looking at also staring at a computer screen for hours on end is very bad for your eyes and can cause very serious vision problems in the long run. Plus, I'm sure you've heard how many typists are more prone to arthritis or any problems with pain or loss @MONEY1 the use @MONEY1 their fingers because @MONEY1 the movement @MONEY1 your fingers when you are typing. Getting rif @MONEY1 computers will help to impact peoples' well- being-in a positive manner. While many people enjoy the use @MONEY1 computers, there is really not that great @MONEY1 a need for them. Books are better resources, you can find fun in many other ways, and they can be dangerous/harmful to health. Why spend hundreds or @MONEY1 on a tool that is not even necessary? Don't let the media fool you or pull you in with their tricks, scams, or gimmicks to get you buy one, and next time you go to turn on your computers, thinks "" @CAPS5 I really need this or is there a better way to achieve what I need to get done or what I want to @CAPS5?"" because, more than likely there will be a better way. So, sometimes it's better to say ""@CAPS6 with the new ways @MONEY1 doing things technologically in with old ways @MONEY1 doing things manually."	6	6		12																					
347	1	"Dear local @CAPS1 I hear you are not sure if computers are good or not well they are and I have many reasons why but I will tell you is. First the games teach hand eye coordination, teach people about faraway places like other countrys, last it helps to keep in touch with people. My first major reason is it can and does help hand eye coordination every day. It does this with the mouse you have to be very coordinated to be good at the games on the computer. This will help in every day lives to to play catch with your son or to pick something up it is very important. Also it can help you get on ethnic back round to learn about faraway places. If you are going on a trip I would want to know about that place to see what I need. Or to just look at how beuatiful the countrys are will make you amazed. So for just @NUM1 reasons I would already rethink. Finally I think this is most important reason of to stay in touch with I know my mom dont got a facebook and she talking to all he old friends she says ""nice"" I think have friends is very important to everyone and computers help them. I conclusion there are reasons why a computer is good like hand eye coordinations learning about faraway places. So I hope you have been I know I would have and there is no doubt is my you will make the right choice."	4	3		7																					
349	1	"Dear, whom @MONTH1 concern; Local Newspaper. I belive you are right. Computers can be helpful, let us chat with people but we don’t exercise. Forget about family and most importantly yor health their vision gets bad, they eat more junk foor and that can lead to bad cholersterol. High blood pressure and even diabities. A computer is very addicting people stay up on it for hours. It will give you bad higiens so I think you should really take a look at this and put this on the Newspaper and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 residents I know it could be very fun and ejoyable but it would be all fun and games until your very sick you @MONTH1 take this as but this is highly serious in many ways. Not being with the people you love not doing any activities you people need to get off that computer and do more in your life for. A computer is like a drug but do it for your family and listen to my point of view so I think all computers should be banned for at least one week to look up on work or school and maybe even your health. This @MONTH1 seem like were overacting on this but we really arent. Do you want population on people having diabetis and other causing affects that can happen to your body increase. Well I think not how would that make you feel. Not good al all so people get of your feet and jogg. Do whateverenjoy time with your family. So just listen to me and stop this badd habbit."	4	4		8																					
355	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I think that computer are a waste of time, but they also help you in many ways. You should only go on the computer if you really have too. Peple are on the computer for hours at a time, they go on the computer if they are bored or if they don't want to go outside. People have made the computer daster and more effective. So more and more people buy computers each year. Computers als helsp you in al of ways, you can learn from a computer, you can find a job on the compter, and you can also shop on the computer. So if you need to find a job then you can go on the computer and find a job that is right for you. You can learn from the computer. The computer can give you so much information it is unbeleiveable, you can look up anything and even ask questions. Last, you can shop on the computer. Say you can find something in a store and you looked everywhere so you go home and you can go on the computer and find what you are looking for. But, you most likely are going to need a credit card. So this is why I think computer are helpful but a waste of time."	3	3		6

Computers also are another way to comunicate to people for away it only a few houses down. Computers have a of knowledge and more is added everyday. Everyday i go on the computer i learn something new. You can search the word @LOCATION1 and instantly have millions of web pages in fron of you that all had new knowlage and exciting things about @LOCATION1. Computers are much faster than having to go down to local library and look for a book that has the information you need. You can also find diffrerent veiws and perspectives of a subject online. Depending on what website you go to you can get opinions on certain places and events, which you cannot find books at the library. Computers have a amount of knowledge instantly and also some opinions of things. Computers can also entertain you. There are many entertaining website online that you can go to when you bored. There are books and magazines you can read at anytime you want. If you like to read then check online, these @MONTH1 be a book you enjoy free of charge to read. Some people like to play games. On the computer you can find almost any game you want to play. These are board games, video games, strategy game, adventure games, and many many more than that. I could go on for hours listing at the different types. If you like sports you can look on the internet and find pages about different sports. You could find ways to improve how you play or you to play that sport. If you like to watch @CAPS1. you can also do that on a computer. Some @CAPS2.V programs put the diffrent episodes online so people can easily view them just by one click of the mouse. Computer can anybody who uses it. Computers help tech you things entertain you. but they also can communicate to your friends and family. Many programs let you to people through the internet. You could send emails to your cousin half way across the world. In emails you can attach pictures and files with text to communicate. These are various programs. IM means instant messaging, that means that instantly you message to another person using that program. You put a message in and away it goes instantly reaching ther person you trying to teach. Now thse are even more to communicate. you can make audio calls to a person using the computer. It is like a phone just not.Web cams make it possible to record and send video instantly, but can also uses to talk to one through a video call. The program connects you to your friends or family and you can see them thourhg a video. computers are a great way to comunicate with others. Computers help in a positive way. They give you access to an amazing amount of information. They can you. Computers also great way to communicate to people no matter how far away that person is. I would completly say that computers are a positive thing."	5	5		10

Computers, give exercise in a way it makes your fingers move faster. The computer is the best thing ever that happend to this world you can chat with your friends family, print writing play games. What can get better than that we can research a famous person google dead people look up pictures. But the computer makes you lazy because it makes you wana just sit there never get off of it its addicting to people but others just don't know the meaning of using or having a computer. If the others had an computer they would change there mind. You can go on myspace thinks to tom talk to friend family people from a diffrent town, state. You also can go on google yahoo, facebook, twitter the computer and internet is really fun and it give you a little exercise. And it helps you with your school work, home work, research of a country, place, house, vacation you can do lots of things. But then the other people have a point enjoying nature is good because it gets you healthy strong and it will get playing sports more and having fun outside instead of staying in side all day doing nothing staring at your computer screen not wanting to get sleep or going out side so both pretty much the same to me but I do with the first opionion because computers are the best!"	4	4		8																					
365	1	"Can you imagine a world full of lifeless zombies obsessing over technology such as computers, television, and cellular phones? Our world as we know it will come to an abrubt end if we don't stop this nonsense. Computers can cause obesity, a lack of interactment, and they waste their time on these useless items. Our world can't set aside time for such. Our planet is run by us humans and if we don't take care for its necessities, we will all die including our beloved planet @LOCATION1. Computers aren't a benefit to our society today. First off, computers can cause major obesity like it has done already. Obesity is one of the most brought up health problems in the world. Many issues cause obesity but technology (computers) take a big role in it. Instead of sitting on a computer all day, they can do something a lot more productive such as taking a walk starting a club (adult once children!), help out neighbors ect. So what if they teach hand eye cordination they don't teach us how to stay fit! Computers play a big role in the obesity factor. As adults, you should know how much obesity matters. Children are the future nobody would want the future leaders to be known for the widespread obesity. Never theless, computers take away ""bonding"" time from family and friends. Adults and children alike are lacking social needs. They don't verbally and physically interact ith their ""online friends"". And they wonder why families these days are turning out the way they are the source of the cause is computers. Anyways, people spend too much time on computers if people didn't waste so much time on computers they wouldn't be losing jobs like dropping flies. The unemployment rate is high because they suppose they ""don't have enough time"". When all their time is devoted to To computers if they took out the computers in their lives, they would have @CAPS1 of time to do such. No one wants a ""stay at home"" unemployed loser as themselves. In the end, computers are not a benefit to our poorly run society. They cause obesity, corrupt social needs and eat the people's time away, you @MONTH1 think computers allow others to ""chat"" online with their ""online friends"" but they don't provide our physical and verbal social needs which results in a low self esteem. If newspapers keep publishing articles about the ""benefits of computers."" people will soon stop believing that non sense and eventually stop purchasing these newspapers. Nobody wants to read lies, do they?"	4	5		9																					
367	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 is a lot of positive things about technology, especially computers. Computers gives you a chance to communicate with people from all around the world; also computers gives you the opportunity to go on educating websites, and last makes it easier to shop and pay bills. Talking to people from around the world can be interesting. Computers help you do that, using the internet. You can learn almost different people and their cultural background, or even talk to your friends and families that live in other cities, states, or maybe even countries. Yes, some people might say they cost too much, but that's really only a one ime price. Computers can be very helpful to students as well as teachers. That reason is because students can get homework help on educating websites. On the other hand it helpful for teachers because they can put their students grades online and won't have kids bugging you about what's their average in a certain class. Yes, I know their are bad unappropriate websites, but their are a lot of ways to block them. For an example I had a @CAPS2 in @CAPS3 and I needed a lot of help, and my teacher told me about a website called studyisland and by going on that everyday boosted my grade up to a @CAPS4. Computers give you a chance to get your bills paid and do some shopping for a cheaper price. Their are ways that your things that you buy online could come a few days late; but think about how much time and money your saving because you ordered offline instead of going to the store. But it's also very helpful to people with disability. They're are a lot of positive things about computers. They give you a chance to communicate with people across the world, and gives you a chance to go on educating websites, and last helps you pay bills and go shopping. Local Newspaper computers are a big benefit too society, and without them a lot of things would'nt be possible."	4	4		8																					
368	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON1, Computers have helped us in many ways. Computers have helped children and adults learn, increased the amount of jobs and computers have helped law enforcement as well. Yes, i, agree some people do spend too much time on these machines, but that doesn't mean they haven't helped us. Computers help children and adults learn so much. Children can use their computer to re-search homework they're doing or even just research thing for fun. Most adults have been through school and are educated but computers help them make discoveries about space, the human body, etc. So not only are computers teaching children, but they're part of making new discoveries that need to be taught to children. Right now our economy is not doing to well. A ton of people are out of jobs and can't support their families. But imagine how many more people would be out of work if we didn't have computers. @PERCENT1 of our society works with computers. An that means @PERCENT1 of the people won't have jobs. Computers not only give us knowledge but they give over half us catch the members of society that do wrong. Computers have helped catch law enforcement for a little bit more than @NUM1 years. Yes, crime has gone up in the past years, but computers have helped us catch criminals. Computers store massive amounts of data, which means we can story already arrested criminal's finger prints, pictures, @CAPS2, previous record, etc. to help us catch criminals. So yes computers have helped us in more ways than one. Computers have helped children and adults learn, increased the amount of jobs, and helped law enforcement. Even if people spend too much time on thse machines, it's their decision and look how much computers have helped us. Make the right decision let out technology continue to edvance."	4	5		9																					
374	1	"Dear local Newspaper, I believe that people who uses alot of technology such as computer are not good, technology can affect adults and even more is children. Children who go on chatting websites such as facebook are starting to see a difference which is in there grades. I found out children who gois on face book are starting to not turn in home work and there grades are going completly down, I heard a student say once he had got on face book he stoped doing his homework and reading his grade dropeed from a @CAPS1 t a @CAPS2 average because he was much focused on the computer than school and his reading. I belive computers can be really addicted to people the first time you get on a website it go's from once a day to twice a day and further on its as if the computer is sometime connected to you and we can let go. People who allow themself to chat online can also be a dangerous thing, young females and males think its exciting to chat with some one in a different state or city but its not exciting its very dangerous. Chating online is very dangerous because the person that you are talking to could have murdered people or could have kidnapped kids or could be wanied but we wouldn't know because on chat lines you dont have to put your fear name, you could put a false picture, and unknown age that's why in cases something go missing because they didd'ent think before they started chating. Another reason why using or being on a computer can be bad because it can lead to a strong distraction from you family instead of sitting down and asking your family now was thier day you'll be in a rush to go on the computer. The computer can also lower you test and quiz grades you can be on the computer for a maximum of hours that you need to be studying for a huge exam the next day and when you fail theres no one to blame but yourself because of your addiction to the usage of an computer. In conclusion @PERCENT1 of people have been affected by computers and its not a good thing you could miss a day out of work or you can be tired and exhaused because all your energy is wasted stay off of computers unless educational."	3	4		7

People think computer benefits society, @CAPS3 it don't people learn more they also could talk to people online if they dont got a cell phone to talk you could also research places you wana go to vacation and you could see how it look. Computer is one of the best things they inveted, but is bad to some people because they want to search direction and vecation places but they cant so is hard for people who dosen't got a computer to find out, computer dosen't benefit the society. Those who support advances in technology belive that computer have a positive effect on people. A computer is one important in ma life if @CAPS2 behind in some classes I could do some research and study at home and learn about it. I lost ma cell phone but now I talk to ma friends online when ma parents dosent wana take me shopping I go shopping online is easyer to look fourwut you want.

381	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, more and more people are getting hooked on computers. I am here to say that computers are not the best way to benefit our society. First off, most @CAPS1 are spending less time with friends/family and more time looking through a screen. Also, it would be so much better for our bodies and minds to go out and enjoy nature instead. Lastly, you can get addicted to the computer. So here are my reasons why computers do not benifit our society. My first reason includes friends and family. more and more people are neglecting to spend time with their loved ones to get to the next level on '@CAPS2 wars.' @CAPS3 this really how we want our future generations growing up, looking blankly at computer screens? I know I don't want that. I lknow this from personal experience. When I was young, I visited my cousin @PERSON1. All I would get to see of him was a quick '@CAPS4', but then held escape to his room to continue clicking angry on the computer. The point @CAPS3 you can't replace family and friends with a computer screen. It's not right. My next argument against computers @CAPS3 about our bodies and minds. The best way to take care of those things @CAPS3 nature. Unfortunately most @CAPS1 aren't getting outside for a wack of exercise due to computers. In fact almost @NUM1 @CAPS1 say they spend more time on the computer than anywhere else. This @CAPS3 not a good way to spend time. We need to solve this issue before more @CAPS1 make the switch from nature to computers. Fresh air, trees and birds are much better than a screen, a couple clicks, and the hum of a machine. My third and final reason @CAPS3 about addiction. So many people are getting adicted to the things they are finding on their computers. Addiction @CAPS3 a very sericuse matter that we need to fix. All of this @CAPS3 pointing to lazyness too from lack of intrest to anything else. I know this from personal experience. When my brother first got his computer he literally locked himself in his room for days. All he did for almost a week was socialize and beat his personal best score on a game. This @CAPS3 not the way to be treating a device. So, as I know you can all see computers don't have a positive impact on our society. First of all computer @CAPS3 over ruling family and friends. Also, nature @CAPS3 becoming less and less of a priority with the computer in mind. Lastly it's becoming a worldwide addiction. Thank you for deeply considering all the arguments that I have to offer. I know it majorly helps people keep in touch globaly, but there are other ways to do it, such as mail."	5	5		10

Or how would we learn about the places we want to see, and the places we want to stay away from? We need computers to do this. We would never even know of some countries if it werent for computers. Next computers help us with our school work. Sometimes we get project spend most of them involve research! Computers make this a whole lot easier on us. Also instead of lugging your text books from school to home and back, we can use online textbooks. Why give us extra work, it's a waste of everyones time. Instead of wasting your minutes talking on a phone, you can chat online. Wasting minutes is wasting money. Who wants to do that? Besides using the keyboard to chat with friends will help you in the future. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 studens, say they prefer to talk online then to call someone.

Computers are good for many reasons: @NUM1 reason is because people can learn about far away places; @NUM2 they can talk to people and learn about their culture and @NUM3 they can teach hand eye coordination. First off if you're taking you want to learn about where you are going. Computers can help with that! Also if you want to find good hotels you can use the computer for that. If you need transportation just log onto google and type in what you're looking for. Now if you are doing a project for school or something on a different area of the world you can log onto your skype, facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or any other website that you. You can @CAPS2 many things while talking to freinds on the internet, such as: find out school assignments, find out due dates, make dates and many more wonderfull things. Hand-eye coordination is very important. Computers can help with that. Drivers need very good hand-eye coordination; if you don't have that then plan on a big insurece bill. If you don't have good hand eye coordination then you are going to have a hard time with a lot of stuff. So thats why computers are a good thing to have in our society. You can learn about where you are going, stuff that you need to get done, and even become a better driver."	4	4		8

Going to the library is just as useful if not more useful than going on the internet. lastly, have you thought of the damaging affects, trojans, cyber bullying, violence? In other words, computers are just a negative waste of good money. Families are becoming less and less connected with each other, who's to blame. It's that big book of technology on your desk. Rather than socializing and just spending time with family and friends, computer addicts choose to sit on their butts talking and gaming away. They are teaching our family apart."" @CAPS1 one @LOCATION1 man on her two tennage children's computer obsession. ""I swear they're on that thing for hours on end"" she claims. In an artical I was reading the other day it said that most people who suffer depression admitted to being online for atleast @NUM1 hours per day. What does all of this go to show? Computers are abuse take them out of your child's life, or atleast limit them. Studies prove that @PERCENT1 of people who spend most of their day surfing the web have either over-weight or just on the boarderline of being over-wright. Rather than going into the real world and experiencing life for themselves, they look it up online and rely on other people's opinions. Does this mean anything to you? People who are overweight have a higher risk of aging, and if not, then they have some pretty health problems. All because they didn't want to breath like. When in a library environment people tend to be more and more on task. You @MONTH1 ask yourself the answer is simply that the is too expansive and distracting. If you are in the library you can't get in as much trouble, you can't play online games, or even be looking at things that are innappropriate. Libraries hae more credible sources and reliable information to study from. Not to mention you can go with a family, friend of even be tutored. Computers dont provide that. Going to the library is such a better solution. I must admit, I was before a computer addict, and believe me the effects it has on people are atracious. Now that I've moved on from that period of my life I can honestly say, the addictive grasp it has on you is strong I know. I also know first hand the rewards of being clean from this harmful drug per say. I am more sociable than ever and im dealing with issues much better.

The reason why it is so popular paper want to talk to friends that they enjoy talking too. From my experience out from canada have @CAPS2 too, which is surprising. Talking to in country is unbelievable. As you're opportunity for people to make new friend. This can also affect the way people lively. When teenagers attend high school, they have a choice of talking a specific, almost like a helping one classes is because when you are in college, so many in a short amount. I have people who stay up for our their paper. @CAPS1 these are an advantage for everyday life, especially college because it is an oppurtunity for someone to get better at typing computer classes can really help someone trying to learn how to type at a fast pace, and get a caple more hours of sleep! In conclusion, I believe @CAPS1 computers effect our society in a positive way. Thank your for reading this letter, and I hope you can take this into consideration. @CAPS1 computers have dramatically changed lives forever. "	4	4		8																					
405	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people surveyed in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 agree that the use of computers benefits society. I personally concern with these @NUM1 people, computers have a positive effect on people. There are multiple reasons why I think the use of computers really benefits society, including it can teach good hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn abour faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Once again I do believe computers can have a positive effect on people. First of all, its's a proven fact that most sports on physical exercise to involve hand-eye coordination to some extent. The computer can help reach people from a very young age good hand-eye coordination. When a person uses a computer they have to keep an eye on the screen but still be able to use the mouse or keyboard. This takes alot of coordination if you think about why don't even love to look at the mouse on keyboard when they are typing, they just know where everything is. People disagree with what I'm saying often use the excuse that when people spend to much time on the computers they aren't getting enough exercise. However, I believe that is not true. The hand-eye coordiantion people learn on the computer help to improve their skill and coordiantion in sports, for example in baseball a person has to be looking at the ball to catch it, but at the samee time they have to move their arm to catch it. That is were the hand-eye coordiantion helps. This proves that computers can benefit society through teaching people hand-eye coordiantion. In addition to this @PERCENT1 of teachers at @ORGANIZATION2 believe that computers can be used as a great tool to help students learn. Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. They give people acess to information about a foreign place or people be available in or other resources areas. On the computer one can go to a search sight and type in my place in the whole world. Then all they have to do is search and they have dozens of with information of that place and pictures, @CAPS2 are a society that is advencing in technology people are learnings learn and they can wtih great the of a button. In addition is think it's also a tool in schools. Teachers can have students do projects about different countries on people and the student can easily that the information on the computer. Computer benefit society in the way that they can teach about different loaction and people. Computers can help people become interested in these different topics and @MONTH1 be even inspire some people to go to these faraway places or hack different people. Finally, @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people asked had some kind of way to contact with people online, whether it was through email or facebook. Computers allow people to take online with other people. In our modern society it is very important that a person has friends, are great why to keep in with friends, if live very far away from you on it haven't to them in a while connecting them on the computer is a great way to keep i touch. Those who disagree with my opinion believe that spending time on the computer means less time with family and friends. I believe taht is just the opposite. Since @CAPS2 are living in modern ages families understand that kid leaves to college they might be going far away or even across the country. Having computer allows that family to chat an easy way to keep in contact talk with each other. People talking each other on line is just another way how computers benefit society. Its now or never! Computers can have benefit society. They reach people hand-eye coordiantion can be use all through our life. Most importantly they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Lastly they allow people to talk online with others. @CAPS2 are living a modern time, society is advancing everyday and computers are a huge part of it! They are having a positive effect on people."	4	5		9																					
414	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you agree that computers effect people? I think I @CAPS1 agree that computers affect people. I @CAPS1 agree with this statement because people dont get use to doing other things then stay on the computer. One example is that people that @CAPS1 stay on the computer wont have much fun on other people. They wont enjoy as much by stay on the internet. My last example is that doctors sometimes say its not good for you to stay on the the computer. First of all, people that stay on the computer wont have much fun on othe poeple. I know one of my friends love to get on the computer and stay on it for a long period of time. One idea in that there not alot to do on a computer for some people. People dont go out and have fun like going to the mall with your friends. Some people try to focused on the computer if theres something importent they have to do. Thirldy, people wont enjoy themselves. When @CAPS2 on the computer I really dont enjoy myself by just sitting there on the internet. One important fact is that you wont want to enjoy a beautiful day with your family when ther going to the beach. People will take maps for a while and not want to go back to sleep and you wont have nothing else to do for the rest of the day. Sometime you wont have a good life without enjoying it. Lastly, doctors say its not good for you to always stay on the computer. One important fact is that you always need to excersise instead of lamping around. Sometimes might happen to your eyes because your steading looking at the computer. You need to do healthy things to help your body. In conclusion, I had agree on the statement and my reasons why was because you wont have fun. You wont enjoy yourself, and doctors. Say its not good for you I hope you liked my prompt so it can go in the newspaper."	4	4		8

Although computers are all around us they do not have a possitive effect on people because, harmful people could findout where you live and they are too addicting. Where ever you look you can find a computer. At home, in school, in your car, at work, and hotels. Being exposed to these computers are helpful. Everything we see now a days is run by or has a computer. In the future we are going to see more and more computers. Buisnesses practically run off of computers, soon they will run them by thereself. Also with so many computers it creates jobs. You can make computers, program them, fix them, and even supervise them doing work. Even though everyone says they are safe on the computer, they are not. While on a chatting website you could meet someone and they might be a child melestor or a. They can find out where you live and when no one is home or when you are home alone. With your address they can even look at your house on a website or possibly get your houses blueprints. Then they can come and leave you mentally scared for life. There are tons of things you can do on a computer. For example you can play games. There are games with virtual worlds or games that are fun and have no meaning. Either way games on the computer are too addicting. You say you are going to play for @NUM1 minutes but they are so addicting you play for @NUM2 hours. The games just suck you in and your stuck. Although computers are all around us they do not have a possitive effect on people because harmful people can find out where you live and they are too addicting. Computers are good and bad at the same time. People need to know when to stop using it or it can drasticly change your life."	3	4		7																					
432	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Experts say, ""@PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 spend @NUM1 hours or more on the computer daily"" The reccomened time limits is @NUM2 hour. By spending more time on computers people aren't exercising. Secondly, those people aren't enjoying life and nature. Lastly, the use of computer puts a strains on social skills between friends and family. Surely the effects of computers cant be good. First off, people in this aren't exercising as much as they should. Obesity and diabetes effects <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of @CAPS4. Both of these diseases are lethal. If you spend so many hours on the computer these diseases wouldn't spread nearby as fast. When will you get off the computer for an hour and go outside or to the gym and exercuse so these won't affect you? Secondly, nature is a marvelous thing. Sure camping in a tent and catching dinner isn't for everyone. But, there are many ways to experience nature without ""roughing it."" You can go to the or to the aquarium. Sit on your back pond and go bird watching. All of these are great alternatives to sitting at the computer screen, looking at pictures of nature. Lastly, people aren't spending enough time with family and friends. Yes you can email, I. M., @CAPS5, and @CAPS6 family and friends, but its not the as people are less and friendly then they. Mainly of socia skills. We need to the of social without computer. In conclusion, computer do have a negative affect on people in the long tern. People aren't exersising. They aren't enjoying nature. Finally their bonds between friends and family are weahiming. This is a growing problem which must be put to end. Thank you for your time."	4	4		8

The computer has helped mankind with various discoveries about our world. As far as many can see, this piece of technology has positive effects on people everywhere, everyday.

How many times has it been said that communication is key to a healthy relationship? Computers, believe it or not, are on easy and way to maintain contact with far away people. Some friends and family keep in touch completely by computer. Because they don't live close enough to visit daily. If one is cautious and uses internet safety techniques they can make new friends with common interests through computers.

470	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, This leter I am writing to you is about how computers affect people. I am concerned about computers use in our society because people that spend too much time on the computer spend less time outdoors, exercising, and with family and friends. Let me tell you modre about it... As stated in the paragraph above, one reason I am concerned about computer use is that less time is spent outdoors.""Everyone, young or old, should get outside for some fresh air for at least @NUM1 minutes everyday,"" @PERSON2. Using the computer could limit this time, and that probably isn'@CAPS1 healthy being in the house all day. A second reason @CAPS1 worry shout over- usage of computers relates to the first reason. Too much time on the computer limits the amount of exercise you get everyday. ""People should exercise an hour a day to stay healthy,"" ssays health expert @PERSON1,"" however @PERCENT1 of people don'@CAPS1 because of computers."" this happens often especially if you are playing a fun game with many levels. You plan to play for @NUM2 minutes, but the @NUM2 minutes turns into @NUM4 minutes, which @MONTH1 even turn into an hour! I know still @MONTH1 be hard to understand why I'm concerned about using computers, @CAPS2 I have one more reason. My final reason in this letter of why I don'@CAPS1 like over using computers is that it limits the time that can be spent with family and friends. How of you can see your family and friends on the computer using a webcam. But it's not the same as spending quality time. ""Friends come and go and you and your family won'@CAPS1 live forever,"" says therapist @PERSON3"", @CAPS2 motor the best of that you have."" there won'@CAPS1 be many if you eyes are glued to the computer screen. As you can see there reasons why I am concerned about people spending time on the computer. There's less time to exercise enjoy nature and interact with family and friends. I hope you take this into concideration."	4	4		8																					
479	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some people are debating whether advances in technology, such as computers, are benefitial to our daily life. I think that computers are a good addition to life for a few reasons. For one, information and knowledge are at your fingertips. It takes merely seconds to know anything you want or need to. Email, @CAPS2, @CAPS1, etc. can be labeled as wasteful or dangerous. New friends can be made everyday. Lastly, there can be limits set so no more worrying about to much time spent on the computers. One of the reasons computers can be benefitial to our daily life is what it can give us. Knowledge is just seconds away. Anything you might be interested in learning is all on the web. Homework, school projects, and even work need information that isn't found anywhere else. The library is a great place to find what you're looking for, but if you're in a hurry and need what you're looking for quick, there is the online encyclopedia, world book, etc.Technology is becoming a huge part of our life today, many opinions are up in the air about it. If, there's one thing everyone can agree on, it's fast and can make daily tasks easier. Ordering clothes, books, movies, tickets for trips and more all can be done online. That's not all the computer has to offer. Friends/family are a necessary part of life, but they're not always living right around the corner. They @MONTH1 live on the other side of the state, country, even world! @CAPS2, @CAPS1, email, etc. can allow you to connect with anybody around the world at anytime. E-mail has been around longer than other websites like @CAPS2 and myspce which allow you to keep daily tabs on them. @CAPS1 or ichat allows you to instantely talk to anybody that you want. These websites can't replace being together in person, but it can help keep in touch for the meanwhile. Some are worried about spending too much time face to face with the screen, there is even something to prevent that. Time spent inside on the computer is becoming a problem. Not enough exersise or time spent outside can be unhealthy. Time limits can fix this problem. A certain amount of time can be plugged in. When there's @NUM1 minutes left, it gives you a warning. That way more time can be spent outside in the open, and less inside staring at the screen all day. Many different opinions about whether computers belong in our life have been shared. I believe they're a beneficial part of our life. They allow you information at the touch of your fingers, access to friends/family, plus there's time limits. In this day/age, the computer is something we can't live without."	5	5		10																					
491	1	"Dear, @CAPS1 Who would'nt agree that more and more people are using computers. The isusse is @CAPS2 bad or good for you. My opinion on this matter is that agree that computer are bad and people are spending. Too much time on computer. Also I agree with that because people are spending more time on computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friend, And thats my opinion on why people spending to much time on computers. Cearly you can that people spending too much time on computer and less time exercising. I say because i rember a time when my you to spend most of his time on computers and not for school eitner he would story on for all most the whole day he would bring food up stairys and throw the plates on floor just keep eating and eating and go to sleep without doing any thing. He would do this day after day. when I go over his house it would be dirty after all those times my my to hold him to clean up he didnt after he ate I ash edition want to got for a you can @PERSON1 the of and caliores he would say no I can walk on the computer, @CAPS3 one day he became really part and the doctor said you obeased but do you think he cared no but we would try to push him ever day to exercision know he has dibietes. We told and him told him spending to much time on computers is bad for you. Another reason why spending too much time on computer is bad because you need to learn how to enjoy nature and get out scid. I rember a time when my friend would story in his house for day on a computer when I would ash him to come out sid he would say no all time, @CAPS3 one he to come out sid to get a new computer sofeware and when he opend door he got scared of the lite and run in side reason why spending to much time computers is bad for you this prove that get and play get active "	4	4		8																					
502	1	"Dear, local newspaper, Some people are starting to belive that the computers are effecting people @CAPS1 also on that side because some people would stay on it all day, get edictded to it and want do nuthing all day. First reason why computers are effecting people because some people would study on it all day some people when get homw from school or wry they go right on the computer. They would stay on from @NUM1 to @NUM2 at night on the computer and do it nthe next day. Another reasons why computer are effecting people edictded to it because there off all those freind, plus when think on the computer things final reason computer people siting computer. So those are reasons are stay on some edictded do anything."	4	3		7																					
503	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that there is nothing wrong with being on the computer. The computer in my thought helps you learn about new technology stuff such as new games to help you learn or new websites. Also using computer helps you talk to people you know that maybe you haven't talk to in a while and you don't know their number. I think that having a computer makes you smart because i mean you still do other stuff besides be on the computer all day, when you are not on you are either hanging out with friends/family or you are eating or sleeping/working out or just doing something like homework. I believe using a computer is part of you healthy choices and you can lean a lot more than you really think you can. Using a computer and learning in school basically can teach you the same thing. I computer can be very health for you hands because when you are consteatly moving you hands gives them more strength and can give you stronger muscles in your hands and lower arms. Inconclusion, I believe that computers are health for you don't take anytime away from exercising time or time with friends/family/sports/sleep/ or eating. Computers are a hundred percent health for you. So i think that people should keep using their computers but just make sure they fit everything else into it each day."	4	4		8																					
504	1	"Click, click, click, ""@CAPS1!"" @CAPS2 no, your computer froe, what are you going to do now? Computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches you information, you can socialize, and you can improve your skills. Without a computer, you'd be hopeless. Have you ever needed to do a research project, but don't have access to go to your local town library? No problem, @CAPS3 you have a computer at home. You could just sit down type in a few things, and get all the information you need, and more! You can research just about anything on everything, because the computer will have it. Maybe you want to learn something new, but there aren't many books on it, well there you go, the computer is your friend. Many people assume that computers are just for entertainment, to play games and have fun on your free time. What they don't know is all the research engines like google, netrekker, @LOCATION1,etc. All loaded with knowledgable information. Some people sit at home and read to become smarter, right? You can do this with computer, which would probably even be more entertaining than a boring ad book from the library. Have you ever thought to yourself ""the computer is just a way for people to get away from everyone else, and just have time to yourself?"" @CAPS3 you thought that way, you thought wrong! There are many ways to socialize with others through the computer such as e-mail, instant messaging, video chatting, etc. There are various ways to communicate with people through the computer. It is amazing technology because even @CAPS3 someone is in a different country, you can communicate with them in the click of a button. Ever heard of social networking? The name is self-explanitory. You socialize with people all across the world through a network. For example, these is myspace, facebook, twitter, tumblr, etc. That is a fun way to connect with others like relatives you have never met or that live far away, friends, friends of friends, etc. You can even be really social and meet new people, as long as your safe. You @MONTH1 be thinking at this point, that a computer is nothing more than research and socializing. Again, you thought wrong. Computers are a good way to help with your skills. For example, your hand-eye coordination. You look at the screen, type your words, look at the screen again, while clicking your mouse. That really improves your coordination. Also, your hand movement will get better. When you type, your fingers are moving all around the keyboard, creating hand muscles. Not just physical skills, but computers help with research skills. There are certain ways to research information effectively. This can help for future researching, and school purposes. Without all this, wouldn't a person be missing something? Computers play a big part in everyones lives, no matter what age they are. Computers definitly have a positive effect on people."	5	5		10																					
507	1	"Dear local newspaper, I strongly think that manypeople are not benefiting fromusing computers. There are so many more things people can do besides go on the computer. By using the computer, people are getting less exercise, not enjoying the nature, and not interacting with family or friends. By using the computer, people are not getting many benefits. As i mentioned, people who use computers too much are getting less exercise. By not exercising, this could really affect people's health. From recent studies by @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of people whouse computers too much are overweight. That is an extremly high statistic! By computers affecting this many people's lives is ridiculous. This many people really shouldn't be over weight. If these people aren't getting exercise they could become addicted to the computer. If peopole are getting addicted to the computer they @MONTH1 start to do bad things with the computer. They could publish bad things go on ridiculous websites, and watch horrible things. The worst is probably watching bad things. It really puts a bad influence on everyone. Lastly, if you are on the computer too often it could affect your eyes. If you are staring at the computer all day, your eyes @MONTH1 not be used to seeing everything else. It's hard for your eyes to transfer from seeing one thing to the next. Clearly, being on the computer is bad for health. Not enjoying nature is also something that people aren't benefiting from. As you @MONTH1 know, getting freshair is good for everyone. Its always nice to smell the nice @DATE1 air after being in school all day. Many people dont do this because as soon as they get home its to the computer. These people are losi a lot of refreshment. I recently interviewed @PERSON1 she told me that, ""many people don't get to see what's on in the world because of computers."" They never take that to look at anything thats going on around them. By keeping updated. You never know what topic @MONTH1 pop up in school you could always benefit from checking on mother nature. Lastly, there are always animals that need help. Have you ever been in a situation where a stray dog needs a home i have and by helping these animals you're saving life. Many people dont have this opportunity because they are on the computer. Obviously, there are many people missing out on the beauty of nature. My last reason is hat by being on the computer you're not interacting with family or friends. In some cases, the person who is addicted to the computer is the parent. If you're a parent you need to help your family with everyday chores. I know, they can be innoying to have to do but you're helping your family and thats all you can do. Also, if you are a parent that has children they always need help. Some kids are younger and don't know how to find information for a project. But, that's why a parent is there. But, if the parent is on the computer they aren't able to fulfill this requirement. I know that my brother is always looking for help because he is younger. Lastly, family parties and computers do not mix. From past experience, when family has come over my brother has sat on the computer without even coming to say ""hello"" to anyone. I find this extremly rude. I just hope that family members don't get offened by this. Clearly, using the computers takes time away from family. In conclusion, people should have limited time on computers. By using computers people don't have enough exercise, aren't enjoying nature, and spend less time with family. Thank you for reading my opinion."	6	4		10																					
509	1	"Dear editor of local newspaper, @CAPS1 you know that the average person spends three or more hours each day on the computer? The time taken up by staring at a blank screen can be spent helping the community, exercising, or simply having fun with others. All this valuable time is wasted because of computers, spending large sums of time on a computer lessens your time with family and friends, causes health concerns, and alternately @MONTH1 became addictive. First of all, computers @MONTH1 prevent you from spending time your family and friends. Often people come home from work or school just wanting to relax, so the seek comfort from the web. However, a more relaxing activity could be playing a game with your family or going out with your friends. After all, nobody lasts forever and your time with once everyday. This precious time is taken away by computer technology, which will last longer than any human and doesn't even provide comfort when someone is down. For example, a teenager would be on the computer who is making fun of them. This does not benefit the and the bullying could lead to depression deceded with her family or friends, they could probably share a few and make everyone feel good, @CAPS2, time spent on the computer is less spent with family and perends. Secondly, computers can bad for your health, at a the eyes, and people with trouble seeing. typing a lot way the need for spending more time on the computer gives you learn time for examples and often temple you if someone finds a website they really like, they will quite went to visit it often, perhaps even multiple times a day! Along with websites, @CAPS3 games and networks are also very popular and addictive. Computer addiction can lead to health problems (as talled about before) and withdrawal symptons when you try to stop. It's very important that people stop spending a lot of time on the computer to make sure an addiction is prevented before it can even start. In conclusion, computer technology is hurting the human race and could be preventing greater things to be happening in individual's lives. There is less time to do things with your loved ones, more negative impacts on your a rising number of computer addicts because of our modern technology. However, all there, could be prevented if people simply spent less time on the computer."	6	5		11

Earth is a beautiful planet, it has trees, mountain, seas, and humas. We creators the internet and people love it more man the rock they're standing on.

517	1	"Dear local newspaper, Computers are fairly new, everone has one everone wants one! There are so many great things they can be used for. But are they getting used to much? As a student and a teenager I know I am using mine way more than I need to. Sure they are fun, and sure their very usefull but they are time consuming. You @MONTH1 be doing work or chatting with a friend, but your also just sitting their. Being on the computer taks away from lots of exercising or doing other activits. I am deffintly not saying to stop using your computer totally, becasue they are agreat inveshion. But why sit on a computer chatting to a friend that lives right down the street, when you could be outside, playing a game of kickball or something fun. It would be a good idea just to chat on line with the friends or family thay live far from you like in other states. Another time that I would say to use your computer is when doing some work, projects or homework. Or even if your job involves doing research. Computers are a great tool to use. But most people aboose that privilage and go one other websites that have nothing to do with there reserech. So if you need a computer for school or work stay on task! That way you get what you need done. If you are a student or have a job which is the comon day person it's hard not to use the computer. There are so many helpful things to use it for. But that doesn't mean you need to be on it all day and night. Take about @NUM1 minutes to an hour of your day talk to those people you never get to see, do your reach. Then get up and enjoy nature. You don't need more then an hour. I stronly agree with the experts people are spending way to much time on there cumputers. Use it to befit you, and to help you not to kemp you from getting bord. Don't abuse the fact you have enter-net if you need resherech get that done stay on task. Rember an hour a day is more than enough! So get off your computers go out side and stay fit!"	4	4		8

The last reason @CAPS9 searching the web because @CAPS3 you want to get @CAPS4 ticits for a trip look online. @CAPS1's the best way to get them. researcher say @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say getting online @CAPS9 the best way because you can see when the @CAPS4 take off, when the next @CAPS4 also when to come back home. All in all I say that compuetrs are a good thing because they help with you hand eye coordination also. @CAPS3 you have a web cam you can see family members from different states and see the face and talk to them like you are talking In person. The last thing @CAPS9 searching the web for @CAPS4 tickets @CAPS3 you want to go somewhere far a way go online and see when the @CAPS4 and comes back because researchers says that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 People say that getting online for @CAPS4 ticket @CAPS9 the best way to get them. Ask your self woild you like to have the web to seach or not?"	3	3		6																					
521	1	"I believe that people should enjoy nature more than computes. I say this because computers can sometimes get addicting. The people who are addicted will only know about stuf on the internet. people need exersise. They will not get exursise by sitting in front of an computer all day. Computers are addicting. The people who spent most of their time on the computer are the people who are addicted. When they get addicted they will probly fail in school because they do not do their homework. Don't you hate it when you feel week and tierd? Well that is how the people who sit at computers all day feel like alot! @CAPS1 people whant to stay healthy then they should get some exersise daily insted of sitting in front of a computer all day. Alot of people get annoyed when they dont know about stuff when it happens. Most of the people who do that are the people who are mostly on the computers. I say that because the people who are mostly on the computers only know about things when it is on the computer. That is why I strongly believe that people spend to much time on computers rather than. This is because firstly computers get addicting, secondly people need exersise @CAPS1 they want to be and stay healthy lastly @CAPS1 people like to know things the only way they will find out is on the computer"	3	4		7																					
522	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I have herad that you guys are deciding whether or not computers have a negative or positive impact on the society. In my opinion, I believe computers have a very negative impact not only to adults but mostly to students too. Computers in general can be distracting, very dangerous, and give people less time to excercise. Computers in total do not have a bad impact on people. Some people say computers are not distracting, well I say they are. Computers have varies websites such as @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 which can distract people from studying or even doing their homework. @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 are websites where you can chat with friends and see peoples pictures. These websites can be very interupptive when trying to do something important. For example, I am one of the biggest slackers when it comes to doing homework or studying. If I had to choose between doing homework or chatting on @CAPS1, I would choose @CAPS1. But if you actually think about, are these websites benefitting anybody. Homework and studying can actually benefit you in doing better can benefit you in your studies and ferther on in your life. In total, I believe computers are a big distarction. When people go on the computer they go on without worrying a little bit. They don't know the danger behind it. These dangerous computer have people on it called online predators. Online predators sit on the computers basically all day trying to harm others. One website in specific that I herad was very harmful is myspace. This website is even more dangerous then @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. Myspace is like @CAPS1 in a way but very dangerous. For instance, my mom told me that one of her friends daughter had a myspace and became friends with a guy she didn't know. Of course she didn't worry because according to her he seemed a nice guy so she gave him her number. Good thing her mom saw it, otherwise something bad would happend. He ended up being an online predator. Lastly, computer can make people unhealthy. People who stare on computers non-stop can make them not exercise. For example, not playing sports such as soccer, vollyball, and tennis. This is very unhealthy for people in our society because they can become obese and unhealthy. This is why computers can make you not exercise. In conclusion, computers can have a very negative effect on people. It can be very distracting, dangerous, and unhealthy for not exercising. In total, computers cannot have a bad impact on people."	5	4		9																					
525	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I feel that computers are very beneficial to our society. They are very helpful when it comes to homework, you can talk to people online and you can make plans/ without even leaving your house. First of all, computers help us a great deal with homework. Many kids are adamant about it, but with the help of a computer, they will be more willing to get it done. For example, when I have a difficult science/social studies assignment, I can research it on the computer. Also, @CAPS1 I have a just coming up and I left my textbook at school, I can just study on my computer. So, as a result, computers are very helpful with homework and studying. Secondly, computers make it very easy to communicate with others. For example, talking on the phone costs money, and why would you money when you could text, chat voice for free? Also, many people use e-mail because its very easy and you can send documents to others. Lets say, that I had a work document on yearly company profits and I needed to got it to my boss. No problem, I just it to an email and I don't have to drive. Finally, my last point, computers make it very easy to make plans or connections. I know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people love to travel, but you need plane tickets. Just go to the website and do it online. Its fast, easy and safe. Also, @CAPS1 you needed to make reservations for something, like a hotel, you just have to go online, pick a date and when you arrive your room will be ready. I can see how this would be very beneficial to traveling business men who might need a room for the night. In conclusion, computers play a huge roll in the world because they can help with homework, its easy to communicate, and you can make /reservations without even leaving your house. And the best part about them is that they are fun and easy to use!"	5	4		9																					
536	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Even though there are good effects of computers on people, there are also many bad effects. Some of the major bad effects of computers on people are no exercise, you can talk to strangers, and no interaction with family and friends. One of the effects of computers on people is no exersise. One of the most important effect of computers on people is no exersise. Right now many people in the @LOCATION1 are obese because of bad eating and no exersise. One of the problems is that these people don'@CAPS2 get off their computers and couchs to go outside. These people choose to stay indoors and just do nothing except watch @CAPS2.V. and go on the computer. So computers have a big effect on how these people live their lives. Another problem caused by computers is kids talking to strangers. Most kids in the @LOCATION1 are a member of a social network like @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. There are people out there that go on these websites on their computers and pretend to be a teen. This can get many kids in trouble if they are not careful on these websites. Since most people access these websites from their computers its another bad effect of computers on people. Another bad effect is no iteraction with family or friends. When people are on computers, they focus on whats on the computer and not about their surroundings. Being on the computer stops many people from interacting with their family and friends. Not interacting with anyone causes their social skills to weaken since they are always on the computer. This can become a serious problem if a person becomes too adicted to the computer. This can cause many problems between communication throughout the family making the family weaken. In conclusion even though there are good effects of computers on people, there are also many bad effects which can cause serious problems. Computers can cause tragaties in families and/or in that persons's life."	4	4		8																					
543	1	"@CITY1 @CAPS1: I believe that computers (for now) are a good thing for our society. They allow you to see places. If you have a long distance relationship you can talk to them and they have many good excessories. What if you were looking for a new home? You could use google to search of selling homes in a certain location. Then finding some one to move your stuff for a fair price. Computers have many websites that you can go to when looking for that special place. The computer is also handy when you are going on vacation. You can look up the weather for that time. If you are going somewhere for, you can use the computer to find a plane. Computers are helpful when it comes to places! The excessories on the computer are endless. One big excessory that people like to do is games. Games are great to get your mind going. Practically all of the grades require hand-eye coordination. For example, @ORGANIZATION1. You need to remove all the tiles before the time runs out! If you are bored, games are very fun. I think that games are a great excessory. Some people have long distance relationships right? Well, if you have a computer you can have an online. This relieves many people when they know your not there. If you have an email, you can "talk" to your friends that you dont see at school. This gives you a chance to connect with them. Myspace and facebook are very similar. These are what you can use to talk to your friends at school. Computers are very useful. As you can see, I have stated many good reasons. Excessories, "talking" to people. Also, places. Many people use computers in their every day life. Computers are awsome!"	4	4		8																					
547	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I @CAPS2 that computers has benefits to society. First, it gives and teaches you social skills. Next, computers can help you learn new things online. Finally, computers also teach you hand-eye coordination. In the following you will see why I @CAPS2 computers have its benefits to the society. First, computers has its benefits to society because it can teach or give you the social skills you need. On a computer you can interact with others from around the world and make new friends. Therefore, you can learn about their culture and what they do in their country. Also, you can talk and interact with family that does not live with you or is not with you in the moment. So as you can see, Computers has its benefits because it can teach you social skills. Next the benefits it has to society is people can learn things online. for example, you can learn how to use a computer if you don't already know how. Also, you could play online learning games for free or buy a @CAPS3 with more options for learning. Another example is you can look up recent or past events you want to know about and research it. So as you can see, Computers benefit society because you can learn all types of things online. Finally, computers how its benefits because it teaches you hand-eye coordination. for example, you can find all types of games using hand-eye coordination using the mouse and keyboard. Also if you just want time to go by you can use the computer as entertainment by chatting with other and playing games. Believe it or not, you can find boat loads of jobs that uses a computer for any of these also as you can see computers have its benefits because it teaches you hand-eye coordination and gives you some free-time entertainment. In conclusion, computers have its benefits to the social community. First, it helps you learn your social skills. Next, you can learn about any subject online for free if your not the one paying the internet bill finally, it benefits you by teaching you hand-eye coordination. So as you can see, I @CAPS2 that computers benefits society in plenty of ways."	4	4		8																					
554	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people is that computers have a good effect. It's good for education mind exercise and communication all over the world. It could @CAPS2 be bad because it would keep you from getting exircise, being with your family and being healthy. But I still think that there are ways to use computers without the bad cause. Some ways computers are good for you are that you can get a better education when you have websites with so much information. Sometimes these information are flase but if you find the websites you can get the rite information. With all of this information you ran exircise your mind to do better in life. You can @CAPS2 talk to people on the other side of the earth and get more inforamtion from them. If I were to say computers are bad for you I would I say that it keeps you from getting enough or maybe any exircise. Computers @MONTH1 be the reason why ther are so many obese people in the @LOCATION1 @CAPS2 when computers are use too much people part from their family and go into different fantasy worlds that somethimes get you addicted to them. And staying for too long on the computer cause prolems. You can get hurt by just sitting for a long amount of time at once. Being on the computer for too long can @CAPS2 cause eye problems where you will begin to lose your sight and will need glasses which will get thicker as you keep looking at the computer screen for hours and days. But even though computers cause so many problems we can prevent them by using the computer to help us. People dont get enough exircise but with the help of computers they can @CAPS2 find times and ways to exircise so that they can stay healthy. They can @CAPS2 find information about how much time should be spent on the computer to not have sight decrease or worse. Some people live far away from their family so computers really help them stay in touch and to be able to see each other. In conclusion I think that computers are more beneficial then harmfull because they give you alot of information for everything and you can comunicat with people all over the world. And computers can help you prevent those things that are bad for you by showing you ways to use computer that won't harm you."	4	4		8																					
555	1	"Dear newspaper, I heard you were discussing if more and more people using computers was a benefit to society. I believe that @CAPS4 has a negative affect on people. They get to interact with people who arent safe, they spend less time exercising and they get into more trouble thean before. Spending more time, online in chat rooms causes people to meet preditors. Take my friend @PERSON5 she was online one day when a man started to talk to her. She thought he seemed acceptable when he said he was @NUM1 and a model. She flirted with him on and on, day after day until one day her friend logged on and found out the man was really @NUM2 and a pervert. @PERSON5 @CAPS1 the only on that this has happened to @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people in chat rooms say they have been lied to like this. Website designer @PERSON2 say, ""More and more people everyday are falling for lies over the @CAPS5 and getting in sticky situations like getting asked to meet the person."" @CAPS1 the saying ""@CAPS2 talk to strangers?"" Spending all your time sitting down on the computer means less time outside exercising. At triputs, this girl @PERSON4 wasnt in shape enough to stay up with the players. Instead of being our practicing like the rest of us, she was in her house talking on facebook. She wasnt prepared when @CAPS4 came, time to show what you had so she didnt make the softball team. The next year she made captain because she was out training everyday before the big day. She's not the only one with a laziness problem. @NUM5 out of every @NUM6 americans are couch potatoes and choose to go online than to stay in shape. Nutritionalist, @PERSON1 says, ""This generation is worse than the last. They complain when they cant do something but thats because instead of going outside, they're on their butts watching @CAPS3 or online."" @CAPS4's a breath of fresh air, what do you have to loose? Kids seem to get in alot more trouble online then they ever have on the streets. They're out posting threats, dissing each other, sending personal messages or pictures and worst of all sometimes hurting someone so bad they commit suicide one year. The neighbor was more popular than this lady's daughter so she created this person online that the neighbor fell for. The online ""guy"" began trashing the teenage girl so bad she ended up hanging herself. People, including singer @ORGANIZATION1 have been caught in sexting. @CAPS4's embarrasing, innappropriate and against the law yet @CAPS4 still happens. These people are not alone. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people have gotten in big trouble through the @CAPS5. Governer, @PERSON3 says, ""@CAPS5 and phones are destroying this society. Theres too much real life drama already."" @CAPS6't you see something wrong with all of this? My opinion on @CAPS4 all is that we should use the computers less before we all start interacting with people that will scare us, become couch potatoes, and get into huge trouble. @CAPS4's really not worth the damage of getting scared, hurt, lazy, or taking your own life."	5	6		11																					
568	1	"Computers they give you @CAPS1 and reasearch from a for distance from you. But is it good for you? Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe they @MONTH1 be correct. I believe that a computer can be used by finding things out from far distances, it can also give hand - eye coordination, I also believe that it is ok to use a computer if you are just using it for reasearch or other needed actions. When useing a computer it gives you the advantages of researching and studying far away places. This is good because some people have intrest in places around the world. Also, @CAPS2 need computers now adays, thier teachers give the write up typed assignments, or power point presentations. Also, parents you computers for work or maybe to get away from work to take a vacation they need took book it some how. Also, some say using a computer can give you Hand eye coordination. Well, it does in fact when you type. Some @MONTH1 not know this hut typing is a skill, some people type fast some type slow and some are average typers. Also, to teach little kids maybe even some adults, people have created a typing game on the computer it will teach kids how to type. Also, some people who type super fast go to get test to see how fast they type the test gives numbers like seventy words a minute. People naturally type about thirty words a minute. I believe that people should be able to go on computers for needed actions such as research. Many kids have learned about these other websites such as facebook, I tunes, youtube, and twitter. Some become addictted so they never got off. Also, being on all of these websites and more try to give you things. that my give you a virus. Viruses can come in many strengths some can crash your computer some just send boat loads of pop-ups to your monitor. I feel that it is ok to go on the computer to do research or bok vacations. If you are addicted to other websites stop because you will crash you computer with one click of your mouse. Over all I believe computers are a great source to get information off of but should not be addicted so called toy. Computer have a positive effect on people. Just dont be addicted and got outside... and have exercise with friends and family too."	4	4		8																					
591	1	"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 people in the world use coumputers, we all know what computers are used for like surching the internet, games, work and school. Some people think that computers are good to use to help teach hand eye coordination, learn about other places in the world and talk with other people online. I am in @NUM1 grade at mystic middle school. I think that computers are not as good as some people think. Have you ever heard of computer camps. This is where some kids go because they are addicted to the computer. At this camp the kids are pulled away from the computer and pritty much forced to join gropes that do activitys like fishing or working together to solve a mystery. This camp is pritty much known as reliable for kids that are addicted to the computer. Another reason that computers are bad is because of the internet. The internet is a very dangerous. Place because you can chat to people that you dont even know. You never know the people could be messed on in the head. And try to find @CAPS4 where you like and come. you so you always have to be carful who you talk to other wise you could get. Nothing eve really goes right with computers, there alway getting slower and slower every time you use it. About every two years a kid or parent could go throw a computer. Also your computer doesn't have the right @CAPS3 it could get a vins and cost a person a few hundred dollars to get it fixed. Any thing could happen at any time with your computer, @CAPS4 of no where it could just die and not work and @CAPS2 of your data will be gone forever. Now that I have explaines my part of computers people will think different. Would you want to end up like one of those people, that are in a camp because they are on the computer to much. Or you never know you could forever and never be found. I alread know @CAPS5 much it is for coomputers to get fixed, but you might have to find @CAPS4 the hard way. That is why I think that computers just cause more truble for peolple."	4	4		8																					
593	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers take away from our lives in a negative way. New advancements in technology in general take away from our lives negatively. It can contribute to obesity, turn you into a couch potato, and can take away from your social life. It's not that computers arent useful, it's that people are using them too frequently. As a country, @LOCATION1 has more obese people each decade. A good way to lessen the obese population, is to get them out of that comouter chair. @CAPS5 all you do is sit on a chair and play flash games and watch youtube videos all day, your sure to put on a few pounds, Those few pounds do accumulate. @CAPS6 fast food companies like @ORGANIZATION1 contribute to obesity, so do computers. When someone eats a big mac burger, should they go upstairs to play a flash game, or go work out at the gym? Trust me, you arent going to burn any calories by clicking a mouse. People who often use the computer, rarely see the true beuty of nature. They are too busy shooting animated rabbits to go see real rabits. Would you rather take a walkin the park, or stare at a computer screen for @DATE1 and a half hours? The world is a beutiful place, and the more you @CAPS2 @CAPS3, the less you realize it. Being on the computer can even effect your social life. The more you socialize to people you don'@CAPS4 know on the computer, the less you know how to communicate to real people I know that I would want a real girlfriend, not a virtual one. You @MONTH1 be too into a @CAPS4.V. show that your watching on the computer, to even spend time with loved ones. Your family is much more important than a silly computer game. In conclusion, I'd like to say that (in my opinion) computers should be used a little less. Who wouldn'@CAPS4 want to be a fit, nature love, popular kid @CAPS5 people would just spend a little less time on the computer, and a little more time in reality, You could be a kid like that.

We have taken these simple devices to far and haven't used them in moderation. Did you know that at least an hour @MONEY1 exercise is needed everyday? Well @CAPS3 from all over the world are not getting enough exercise because @MONEY1 computers. Parents hard earned money is being wasted away on these extremely expensive computers, they can pay anywhere from @NUM1! What a waist @MONEY1 money! @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 kidnappings are caused because @MONEY1 to much information on the internet, do you want that for your child. Computers were once helpful devices that have now turned in to @CAPS4 worping machines. @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 the world's @CAPS3 are obese today. Why are they abese you ask? @CAPS3 are growing fast they are meant in be active and playful and without any active sport like dancing nor basketball they are going to grow big. Kid's spend as much a @NUM2 hours a day on a @CAPS2, and not keeping active, @CAPS2 pull kid's in like a magnet. This obsessive @CAPS2 time leaves no time to keep healthy active and fit.

Times are tough, money is tight and electronics are expensive. A @CAPS2 can cost anywhere from @MONEY4 TO EVEN @MONEY3 that is a ton @MONEY1 money.

608	1	"Dear, Newspaper @CAPS1 my name is @CAPS2, @PERSON1 and I think that this idea based on why people need computer is a good statement/ @CAPS3. My @CAPS4 oppinon is that same say people use their computers so much they don’t yet exercise. When that is not true do to the fact that computers have. Programms on how to watch your weight. Stocks and etc also Technology helps people around the world on websites, programs such names as to video chat, @CAPS5.com for instant messaging. on the way teen stuff like computers help people for on video chatting, emailing people their rezemates to jobs on why and how their based. On showing people their recent jobs. And giving details on showing people reading this article is that technology of computers also help @CAPS6 save. Most reasons we need tech equipment is that people use it on fields such as the navy, @CAPS6, dealships, all over the world industry. Why is that good well my point of view is that business need that to order their stocks for store carriers and more. For @CAPS6 on field to use for @CAPS7 sean, pregnacy, pulse radar's and more. And on the negative point of those side of the readers are based on the mostly that people get addict to technology when the truht is that people really need technology look around you and everything in this world has mostly been made by technology and. the @CAPS8 is that people should agree. that computers help people, speak, @CAPS9, email, lives, help find family, friends, give directions, so on my point of view @CAPS9 tel your dean @CAPS1 and readers that interacting with technology. Is a good way nto control ways on how or what you do in the computers do to that in my way I make sites audio and interesting Technology can allows people on ways to help people. Find and create ways to making money or interesting positive out comes out of using person in this world goes in and thru out tech equip.

613	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people are using technology. A lot of them feel that it is helping and improving their learning ability, others disagree. I personally feel that computers are an advantage but also disadvantage. I say it can be an advantage because it is giving people a chance to experience above and beyond what they are learning. I say it is a disadvantage because a lot of people are on the computer and they don't get a lot of exercise. There are pros and cons to computers but manly cons. How long do you stay on the computer? @CAPS2 people find computers more entertaing than going outside and getting some exercise. Since technology is advancing, more and more people are going out to buy computers. A lot of teenagers are spending more and more time on the computer, playing games and going on their favorite websites. That is one reason why children from the ages @NUM1 and up are obese. They don't get enough exercise. That also leads into people spending time with your friends and family. I know alot of people like to spend time with their friends and family. But what if you were always on the computer and never made time to hang out with your friends or family. Your friends might ask you to go to the park with them, and you say no. Your friends are going to start pulling away from you. You might end up being lonely. Being on the computer constantly can ruins your life. If you are choosing the computer over other important thing, then I think we have a problem. Going on the computer all the time can became an addiction. I don't think people realize it, but it can. I can take over your life. I say this because when you have an addiction to anything, it is hard to stop. It is possible to stop all by yourself but thats rare. Majority of the times it is best to seek help, I personally think you should take all of these reasonings into consideration."	4	4		8

Secondly, I would talk about people who talk online way too much. Lstly, I would say spending to much time on their computers. To start, people that use computers too much. First, people like to go on things such as myspace, secondly people like playing online games. ALstly, some people like to gosep to others online. For example, if you go to soemones house you are always going to see a young kid or a parent online somewhere or playing online gmaes. Also, peopel talk online way too much. First, they go to face book all the time. Secondly, they got ,myspace which you can get your identity stolen. Lastly, kids love to go on myspace it's the smae as myspace. for example, peopel might come to you and say do you have a so and so and sya can I get your eamail address. Certainly, spoending too much time on their computers is bad. first, kids might have problems online and to keep the problem to get worst. Secondly, might be argueing with a friend. Lastly, might nit be active but live playing or going other online websites. So @CAPS1 did you start to agree with why people should get active outside and have fun. In conclusion, this was why I agreed with beign active because being on the computer all day would get your and hard use too being on the computer @NUM1. "	3	3		6

Like homewrok and projects. @CAPS4 could use it for info on a project or homework. @CAPS4 could use it for the @CAPS8, @CAPS9, and @CAPS10. and many other reasons why @CAPS4 should have @CAPS12 for @CAPS7. @CAPS4 could use the computers for @CAPS5 @CAPS6. Like making holiday and birthday cards. Pay bills for morgiges online. @CAPS4 could book a hotel online. @CAPS4 could play on or agentst with online games. @CAPS4 use for bidding on ebay or amazon. Pay bills for long distance calling. @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS13 if you missed it. Or just @ORGANIZATION1 shows in general. @CAPS4 could use it for chatting online. Like sendding emails or talking on ooVoo. So thats why @CAPS4 sould take the advantige."	3	3		6																					
649	1	"Dear Newspaper, In my opinion, I think computers do benefit society. One reason is because people can learn about new things, it makes life a little easier then it is, and lastly, people can meet new people while they're on the computer. First off, we can benefit from computers because we can learn new things. People can find places that they've never heard of, or they can see whats going on in the world. Computers can help kids that are in school who want to learn new things. Computers help you find out important information that you might need to know in the future. Secondly, having computers in our society can make life a little easier for some people. On computers, you can order things from online websites instead of trying to go out and buy them. For people with no transportation, this'll help make their lives a little easier than it is. Or, for example, if a person wants to buy something that isn't in stores yet, they can go online, and they might have it up there. Lastly, having computers can help you meet new people. If someone just moved from another town or state, this will help them meet new people. Or if a student doesn't know anybody from their new school, they might find them online and then they'll be able to get to know each other. In conclusion, computers help our society in a lot of ways. They can help us learn new things, we all can meet new people. and computers can make our live s a little easier. Thats whay I think we should keep computers in our society."	4	4		8																					
654	1	"Dear to whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, and I feel computers are bad for society. Computers have been the big difference when comparing @NUM1 to @NUM2 centuries. People have come to rely too heavily on computers. The communication globally has not been very helpful and people are spending hours on their computers every day instead of exercising. On the whole I feel society would be better off without computers. At the end of @DATE1 before the millenea would take place everyone feared what was called @NUM3. The year two thousand would supposedly be when all computers shut down and didn't work. Computers were at their beggining for society so everyone thought they were great. People were panicing over the thought of their precious computers not working. The entire nation had become reliant on computers. Everyone hid in attics and basements waiting for the world to end. Do you know what happened? The sun came out the next day and everyone logged onto their emails with a sigh of relief. Not only relief for the world not ending but for the life of computers to be able to go on. People still rely on computers just as much more today. I recently visited @LOCATION1 and in a rest every where the even had their laptop that they had to take everywhere with them. In conclusion the @CAPS2 society is at a sad state with how much they rely on computers. A fast instinct is to say communication when you why humans need computers. Why is that? We have telephones. Is there nation television channels? We have plenty of means of communication, such as ways like maybe writing a letter to someone? Communication would not be a problem in fact it has mainly caused trouble. Computers and internet allow news to be spread quickly even if it isn't free, damaging someones carrer and publicity. They also allow communication with foreign countries. Exess communication that can get countries into wars. Normally the @LOCATION3 would have no idea whats going on but with internet the nation is involved quickly. Computers breed had communication and you can easily communicate other ways with family and friends. Since I am a teen I also know the problems with youths and computers. Often times kids don't want to go outside and istead sit inside on the computer. Obesity is a rising issue in @LOCATION2 and kids need to exercise. Kids also dislike going on trips like camping outings because they don't want to leave their computer. Without computers kids would get more exercise and be less overweight. Now you have seen @CAPS1 reasoning that society would be in much better if there were no computers."	5	5		10																					
655	1	"Dear local newspaper, I think computers are used way to much in this society! People spend more hours sitting the computer than exercising because people find it more thrilling spending more time with computers than trreadmills! People in this society think we are spending to much time on the computers, while others don't realize how long they've been staring at a screen for! I am one of those people who like using the computer a lot but I have relized changes. I can tell many others and spend to much time with the computer screen that we have drifted away from our familys! I never really thought about how much I don't talk to them anymore because I'm to busy cyberly chatting with friends. Although, I don't think we should get the computer either. Online we can research almost everything in the world. I can even type my name in a research bar and find me and anybody else with the excel same name as me! The internet got for more technical in the past years. Without it, these days, just about everybody would be lost! The internet should be used less on blogging and chatting, and should be used more on things more useful like @CAPS1.com or @CAPS2.com. I hope you consider this."	3	4		7																					
661	1	"In present day, most people live on the computer. Whether if for work or pleasure, everyone uses a computer. In a recent study, researchers determined that an average person spends @NUM1 years of his or her life on the comptuer. Thats a total of @NUM1 years of life waste. Most kids spend all day on the computer on @CAPS1, facebook, @CAPS2, and youtube. They could be using that time to be around family and friends making memories. Kids dont realize how short life is, they should be hiking, camping, spending time with friends and family. I think years from now when kids grow into adults, they will be looking back and regretting not spending more time with there family, or not taking opportunities to explore the world we live in. Instead, they will be looking back and thinking about the halarious video on youtube that got over one million hits. Also, as you @MONTH1 know child obesety is on the rise, they are more overweight kids then there are then and healthy. If a you look back to the times before computers, you will notice that you will rarely see an overweight child. The computer is to blame for this new pamedemic. Kids should be outdoors playing sports and getting fresh air. I bet that if computers were taken away for @NUM3 year, then the changes in health would be drastic. Kids would be alot healtheir and have lost the weight I hope that everyone can see the harms of the computer by reading this, and they will get rid of this poisiness object.

668	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand the conterversies between having computers. Computers are the center of technology. I can't imagine a world without them. Though having a computer @MONTH1 cause children to play uneducational games, computers teach more and help children as well. I know for your company, having no computer would be a nightmare. It gives education to not only children, but adults as well. First of all, computers are proven to be the second best source of education, behind school, along with the best source of information. Millions of websites are specified to only education of all kinds. Not only are there websites. these are @CAPS1's with online tutors or just work. Computers provide practically anthing you need. For work, adult use. computers to sell something communicate with someone or just look up a new topic. The technology of a computer is farther than any other item. Without a computer life would be much more difficult. Instend of just sending an email, mail would have to be sent out. Most information would have to from brooks. In fact even the internet has books to buy and read. I am aware that people feel that children are spending too much time on the computer talking to friends, but children need to be social, @CAPS2 it weren't talking on the computer, there would just be more texting and calling. The computer makes life so much easier that to take it away would cause stress and less time for other important activities. Lastly. computers have documents and it is the best way to type. Your company can definetly agree that without typing documents life would be a mess. Everyone writes up documents and needs to send them, open them up again, and edit them. The only other access to typing is a type writer. Types writers can't save anything, delete and do half the work computers do. Your whole job depends on the computer and typing. How would you feel @CAPS2 you couldn't use a computer. In conclusion, computers are a necessity to our living. Without computers life would be difficult and stressful. Computers give education stand information to everyone. The technology is unbelievable and makes everyday life, easier. I couldn't even imagire no documents and typing. I'm sure you will agree with my decision. I hope you chose to inform others with this information. Thank you for your time"	5	5		10																					
670	1	"Some people believe that computers are a positive effect to people, but its positive because it rots you brain. I think that computer is a waste of time and is an excuse for you to not spend time with you family as to go outside and enjoy nature. This is why computer time should be reduced and family time increased. Absolutley, computers is the type of things that can kill brain cells if you spend to much time on it. Teenagers are the main cause of this and when they get on the computer and get on myspace and facebook they wont be learning anything and just kill major brain cells. When they go to school to take the cmts they are going to fail because they wont know anything because of the computer. Also, This is a big problem for familys because they dont hang out with each other because their always on the computer. The excuse for parents is ""@CAPS1 im on the computer"" then they never go and the children get very upset. This leads to anger problems then they stop listening to you. All it is, is cause and effect. My friends on @NUM1 has anger problems and doesn't listen to anyone all because her family never hung. Consequently, peope spend most of their time inside on the computer, you guessed right! my sister is on the computer @NUM2 and she never goes outside to enjoy the nature. People can get that @LOCATION1 were they haute to go outside and we dont want that do eve. Doctor @CAPS2 brown says everyone should go outside to just relax mostly everyday because staying in the house is not good. The computer is defeating that purpose. On the other hand, the computer is a nifty device and can be very handy at times like if your need perfect directions or need a question answered. Sometimes you just want to talk to old time friends you haven't seen in a while. Computers are good for alot of things but to much of it is not good for us lastly, i'd like to say the computer has great purpose but i think it just makes excuses for us so we dont spend time with our family, dont go outside enough to enjoy the nature."	4	4		8																					
679	1	"Could you live a day without a computer? I talk to my friends everyday on the @CAPS1. I learn about current events that I wouldn't know without a computer. A computer also helps me through my daily life. I acknowledge that I should get outside and meet up with my friends, but sometimes when its raining or snowing I just want to talk to them online. Another great thing about talking online is that I can talk to all my friends, not just the one I am playing with. I noticed that even when my friends go away, they can still stay in touch because of their computers. Not only can you stay in touch with your friends, but you can learn about the current events. Whenever I go into @CAPS1 @CAPS2, my @ORGANIZATION1 page comes up and shows me the current events. Without a computer I woudn't be able to see who woll last nights ball game or whats happening with the health care bill. These are important things that help me keep up with things away from my town. A computer also lets me learn mopre about what the healthcare bill actually is and how it affects me. Not only does a computer teach me about current events, it also helps me in my daily life. When I'm eating breakfast, I check my email and look at the weather. During school I type up my essay. When I get home I check the homework and talk to my friends online. All of that is done on a computer. That just goes to show how much I use computers each day. i rely on my computer so much that I would be lost without it and I would get half as much done. I strongly beleive that computers are a necessity. They allow me to talk to my friends when we can't meet up. It keeps me up to date with currents. I think computers have become part of our daily life."	4	4		8																					
680	1	"Dear @CAPS1 man, @CAPS2 would you want people to be on a computer all day doing nothing? How would you feel if no one was out getting excrise, and no one was using the playgrounds, parks and beachs. Everyone will be sitting at home on there nice new fanny computers. When you really do think about how much time people spend doing nothing, just sitting around, @CAPS2 would a computer solve that problem? It really @CAPS4't. This is what I would say to having computers, People spend to much time on computers, excrise is needed, everyday, and it makes your body wear and your eyes strained. When it comes to computers everyone wants to get one, but when we say excrise it seems like peoples mind click off. This happens because people are really starting to spend lots of time on computers. If they work on computers during a long period of the day, @CAPS5 head home to spend more time on the computer, @CAPS5 whats that doing to your body? not helping it. I like computers to and I like spending time on them, when i need to get something done sometime that doesn't happen, because I get and I forget what time it is and that's not fun. Sometime this happens to people they are engaged in there computer, when someone is talking to them and your telling them something you need them to do, and there noding there head like they know what you sayed, but the next time you asked if it got done and it didn't, you know they were listening. Excrise is really important for your body and doens't even have to be to got anything, but don't spend your time wasted on computers. This happens to @NUM1 to @NUM2 or families when they come home from work or school, and jump right on the computers, families are not getting enough excrise or spending time with family because computers get in the way of that. Excrise would help to keep you instead of electronics. Computers are like little robots that control your mind and body, it sucks the life cut of you. It strains your eyes it makes you wrat and you really dont want to do a lot, maybe if people spend less time on computers and more time being more focused on families and nature, they @CAPS4't be weak and tired. I know a lot of people who @CAPS4't want computers to be banned, but I think it would help for a lot of reasons and make families closer and bodys more focused, from my experience computers do help in some ways, but when it comes to real life it helps for really no one. i hope you understand @CAPS2 I say these sort of things, but if you do care about health and activities @CAPS5 you would say that computers are not a lot of help also."	5	4		9																					
687	1	"Computers are a good benefit to society they you to talk to people give different for you the the latest updates. First they allow you to chat with friends they allow you to message anytime you want. You can talk to people the faraway you lose. For example your friend live the other side of the globe you an your computer and message so you can still talk to them all the time. Also when your bored it will give you something to do. You could see if anyone wants to make plans to hangout. And if you just want to stay home all day you can still interact with people. Secondly it gives you new ideas on things. It shares oppions. Maybe someone bought same they and it did not work you could see the comments and review. Would you want to spend you money on some thing that did network? I woudn't. You can also see majority of people like what they got. Also they make you think of something you would not think about before say you had are mark about how this horrible maybe if you read the page it online it shows what you did wrong what you did not do. It gives you the to try something you @MONTH1 enjoy what you get. Lastly it gives you the latest updates it can share if the sched is closed, delayed, or open. You wouldn't have to wait for the news to show it. It can tell you about crimes that are happening. Also it tells you about your town. Who dont want to know whats going on your own? It tells you new things that are in your town or what their going to make or it tells you what it is getting rid of. Computers are they lot us chat with friends and family.

694	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that computers benefit society very much. I believe so fo various reasons that I will state through out this passage. Although sometimes people spend too much time on computer it doesn't mean computers are bad for society it just means people need to learn to spend their time wisely. Overall I think computers have a positive effect on society. One reason I am for computers is because they are a huge advancement in technology. They are able to make everyday life easier. They allow you to store information. Learn about many places, and communicate with friends and family. For one device to do all that is amazing! Also if we can make something like computers imagine all the other possibilities of technology advancements. Computers are only the start of it all! Anouther reason why I believe computers greatly benifit society is because they provide entertainment. You can watch movies on your computer, and download fun games. There is hardly anything you can't do on a computer. If it is cold outside or raining you can still entertain yourself with just a computer. Computers are very great to have around. Now anyone who thinks people spend too much time on their computer and that computers are bad for society is just wrong. I think those people are wrong because a computer can't force you to spend more time on it. It's your own fault if you choose to use your computer too much. You always have the choice to go outside and take a walk. Computers are only wrong if you choose to use them wrong, like the expression ""guns don't kill people, people do."" In conclusion I believe computers are a great thing to have espicially in this modern society. Computer are one of the greates advancements in technology and they benifit society as well. So if you are ever wondering weather or not to buy a computer I suggest you get one!"	4	4		8

I think that you should @CAPS8 the gym and work out you should @CAPS8 out to the park or have family fun night with your kids (@CAPS1 you have any) The last thing I think you should @CAPS7 is @CAPS8 have a little ""@CAPS2"" time for example take your self somewere nice (you'll about time in a second) @DATE1 all you've done is sit home playing farmville and other games and what not you probably get really fastly and you eating right? well @CAPS1 @CAPS3.... boy you gained some pounds of the @DATE1 and you look you need to get your self to a gym. from sitting on your while on the @CAPS9 every day you any calories or fat @CAPS3 when you eat all your doing is gaining weight. and @CAPS4 you probably don't want to. @CAPS7 you have a family? Well @CAPS1 you @CAPS7 I think that taking a family trip to the park would be fun or going to @ORGANIZATION1 would be a fun way @CAPS3 you can get your hands off those keys and your head with your kids. Also you should make other nightfamily fun night and play games and hang out with family on family fun night you can play characles or a board game. (as long as you don't have a in your house) The last my favorite one is ""@CAPS4"" Time. During ""@CAPS4"" Time you can take your self shopping out to lunch/dinner you even take a map the whole point of ""@CAPS4"" Time is that You @CAPS7 NOT @CAPS8 ON THE @CAPS9!! you need to relax and just take a brake.

If you have school work to finish, computers help will work.

Talking to family members can do good for you in many ways. You can be having some trouble in your socical life, you can always talk to a family member or friend secretly through the @CAPS1. I remember having some difficulties with a few friends and one of my cousins gave me very good advice through an instant messaging program named ""@CAPS2"". I garantee you will have a good time using a @CAPS1. There are many games out there that you @MONTH1 enjoy. Playing these games, will teach hand-eye coordination, says @PERSON2.

And when your out in the world you rely need to be able to look at something and pick it up or say if you get into a altercation with someone. So it's rely important to have hand-eye. Another reason why I feel computers have a posative effect on people is because you could learn about diffrent stuff over the internet. Like learning about far away places and people. So the internet is giving you a great opportunity to learn more about or earth, other than your back yard. So technacally it's preparing you for life. My final reason why I think the computer has a posotive effect on people is because it allows people to talk to other people who are online. Like say you dont have a phone but you have a computer and you need to tell something very important to someone; you could do it online. And people say it's one of the fastest pieces of technology known to mankind to people who need it. Those were my three reasons why I believe the computer has a posotive effect on people.

737	1	"Dear (Newspaper), This is a very controversial topic. I am discussing. But on this one, I must say I agree with the experts when they say computers have a negative effect on people. It ruins their social lives, and other bad things. If you spend all your time on the computer, you get no exercise, no fresh air, and you will not get to experience the rest of the world. Not recieving your daily exercise is a big problem. Obesity has already been an issue for millions people in the @LOCATION1 And it is mostly because they eat unhealthy snacks while sitting at the computer the whole day! you want to live a long and healthy life, don't spend all your time having your eyes give to a screen. In adition everyone needs fresh air, right? Going on the computer inside a room is not going to help at all. You need your daily intake of oxygen. Lastly, if you are on long enough, enough, it will become an obsession. Computers already have a bad effect on people all around, and just think about what has just been mentioned. Another problem computers have is that they keep you away from your family and friends. As mentioned before, the social life you had will be gone. With that in mind, people will always see you on the computer, and eventually get sick of you. Computers bring no adventures, just pictures of them. Going out into the real world might be hard, but it is something that should be done. a real life cannot be lived in a dark room with no people or no nature. Haven't you always wanted to travel around the world, see different types of cultures, lifesyles, etc? It gets to the point where computer use should be limite, and living your life should be in place of your free time. Using a computer all day will not let you meet new people, and see new places. You will sbe getting nowhere with a computer screen in your face, so put it away! In conclusion, using computers all the time restrict you from exercising, getting fresh air. Meeting new people, and seeing different places all over. At the end up the day, life is short, so you can't aford to waste it. computers have a negative effect on everbody, and hopefully someday these problems will be changed!"	4	4		8

Computers teach you hand eye coordination, they give you the ability to learn about far away places, and allow you to communicate with others online. Technology is continuing to grow, and it is becoming to impact our lives more and more each day. One way that computers benifit society is that they teach you hand-eye coordination. For example, as a person becomes firmiliar with their computer they are soon able to type on the keyboard with out even looking down to see what letter or number they are touching with their fingers. Although the person isn't developing hand-eye coordination @CAPS2 playing a sport such as baseball, they have still developed this coordination. Computers also benifit our society because they give others the ability to learn about far away places. Instead of walking or driving to the library to find a book about @LOCATION1; they can simply go online and type in @LOCATION1 under a search engine. Within seconds, thousands of sources appear right before your eyes, and you didnt even have to leave your chair! That is another reason why computers benifit our society.

I know when ever I'm at my computer my instant messanger is always open. It is something I utilize everyday in order to communicate with my friends and distant realitive. In conclusion, computers do benifit society, and they are proven to have a positive affect on people.

746	1	"Dear @PERSON1, I'm sending you this letter on the behalf of the people that spend way too much time on computers. Some people @MONTH1 say that you learn different cultures and interact with new people everyday. The truth is that a computer doesn't help you; in fact it hurts you. By spending all day on the computer you will get fat, lose great experiences on the outside and miss out on life. As a whole @LOCATION1 is known as an obese country. This is due to the fact that most people eat and then dont exercise. Most of these obese people don't exercise because they are glued to thier computer. While interacting with others they just keep on eating, most dont even know why they're eating. If we want to erase @LOCATION1 as being an obese country, then we must get people away from their computer screens. It is actually our fault, because we aren't making a stand. We must show people just how bad the computer really is. Also, while people are on the computer they're missing out on the world. They won't go outside, they wont know what the real world is actually like. Imagine cthat being an adult and having no clue about the outside world. Also, the could miss out on life changing exercises the kind of experiments that people @CAPS1, they would miss out on life as a whole. We only have one life, so you better enjoy it. It would be so sad for someone to just pass through life being stuck on your computer screen. I truly feel bad for that person, then again it could be fixed. All that we have to do is take away the computer. If we do this then all the problems will be solved. Finally, if we get rid of computers we will be known as a new nation.

Some people like to look at photos of nature or birds on the internet, even though there's a whole forest outside. Another problem with computers is how safe they are. There are a lot of people on computers that don't belong there, and are trying to hack onto your computer. Viruses can sneak into your computer without you knowing it, and can look up eveything on your computer, even personal information. They can even monitor what your typing, which could be passwords! A lot of people have been paying their taxes online and if there is a virus on their computer, they could get their person's personal information! Plus, most people who pay their taxes online have to use their online bank accounts, so now. They have your bank account password too! Computers are bad for most people. They make people become unhealthy and can get their personal information hacked by a virus."	4	4		8																					
750	1	"Yes, I agree with the concern that expert have. I say this because its true people get on the computer for a long time and forget about their family, there is also all kinds of danger online, and lastly your brain is not getting enough work out. Don't you think all of this is true? Well, then if you still don't believe me I'll prove it to you. First, people get addicted to the computer they forget about there family. Insted of beign on the computer just looking for stuff like myspace or facebook, but they should spend time with their families playing games like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3. I say this from a personal expirience, it wasn't me it was my cousin @PERSON1 he got addicted to the computer so much that everytime his family tried to do something fun together they would always end up fighting because he didn't want to go. Secondly, people can be facing major danger online, for example when you got to those chat sessions where you meet people supposley your age, but it might not always be that way everytime on the news you see stories where old people try act like @NUM1 year olds, but they aren't they just want to do bad stuff. So you can be facing a lot of dangerd online. Lastly, by beign on the computer your not letting your brain get the good workout or exersice it needs. Your just letting it be there, but instead you can be reading a book or do a word seach puzzle; these are all good idea for making your brain exersice. On a recent research experts say that people spend time reading and exersicing their brains do very good on test, but people who spend most of the time in the computer fail test. So don't you think I'm right? Don't you think that if you spend to much time on a computer you have less time with your family. You can be facing serious danger, and your brain is not getting the exercise it needs. Did I convinced you yet?"	4	4		8																					
759	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have heard the concern of many scientists about computers. Computers have brought us into the @DATE1 and have improved our society but they are harming our childrens health and education. Because of computers, children and adults around the world are spending less time with family and friends, they are not enjoying athletic activities and they are having health problems. Because of an increase in technology, children and adults are not spending time with their families. The computers are ruining family connections. For example, a study at @ORGANIZATION1 showed that families with more computers in their houses communicated less. The children are talking to their friends online or are going on social networking sites instead of talking in person to their family members. Also, computers are making it very hard for families to have meals together. When the children are on the computer, they do not want to leave. This obsetion with the technology is making it harder for families to grow moved and of were more succesful in school. The computers are children from a better education. Athletic activities are also suffering been so of @PERSON1, fresh air more children They will be on websites all day insted of being on a. Sports teams because of computers. The electricity that runs computers of this radiation. Being exposed to this could lead to brain damage or possible death. When my aunt bought a computer for the first time, she complained about massive headaches that kept returning. This was caused by the radiation emitted from the computer. Another health risk is obesity. When children sit in front of a computer for many hours, they have an increase in apetite. These children eat because they have nothing better to do. While on the computer, the users eat and will gain weight because of the loss of exercise. They could become obese and possibly get diabetes. Therefore, there is less communication in families, a loss of excersise, and health concerns caused by the computers. The consequences of misusing this technology are devastating and could be life thretening. Thus, I urge you to do whatever is possible to use the computer less or face the consequences that come with it."	6	4		10																					
761	1	"Dear local newspaper, Computers are a usefull tool when doing a school report or something to that effect but, @CAPS2 we really need thoes computers. When using a computer for a school project @CAPS3 can be a hassel. One of many problems people are fased with while using a computer are freazing, when doing a project and your computer frezz's @CAPS3 can be verry time consumming. Another problem is pop up's, pop up's can couse virouses, and when you computer gets a virous, @CAPS3 leads to becoming very slow. Witch leads us to are next problem slowness, when a computer becomes slow @CAPS3 is verry a digital. There are several problems and risks that come with a computer. One health problem is that you can become a hermet and stay inside all day because your too attached to the computer. Another problem is that you can become verry obease because your not getting any physical exersise. One risks of using a computer is that you could end up getting an fassebook, @CAPS1, or myspase, and meating some one who is protending to be some one there not and get abducted by a molester! There are other alternations you could make instead of using an computer. One alternation is that you could go to the local library and cheak out books on your topick that your wanting information on. Another alternation is to ask teachor if she/he could leand you a class text book. But the main aternation is computer to old fashon books! So now @CAPS3's your choice,""@CAPS2 we realy need computers or can we live with out them?"" @CAPS3's your choice!"	4	4		8																					
765	1	"Dear editor, I beleve that people should have computers, The resons are it dosen't take @NUM1 days to email. You can learn about faraway places. Also you can talk to people around the world. After looking at these detail most people are likly to agree. Firstly it dosent take @NUM1 days to email you can email someone and it takes five seconds to get to the other person. While regular mail takes @NUM1 day to a week to get to another person. When you email some one and then the email you back it saves the and government money. Email is much fasters than the mall or I like to call it snail mail. Another reson is that you would be able to learn about diffrent contrys faraway and near. Would you be able to about @LOCATION1 from you living rooms without computers. No you wouldnt't. Without computers would you be able to learn about the earth quake in chile. No you wouldent. Compters are modern day telivision for kids. Lastly you can talk to people on the computer there is many ways to talk to people like facebook, myspace, aim, and vidio chat you don't have to call some one on the @CAPS1 when you can jus vidio chat with them. In conusion computers are good. You can email fast. You can learn about foreinge contrys in you living room. You can also chat with people online. I think computers are good what about you."	4	3		7																					
773	1	The effects of computers to people are that adults and kids are getting way more attention then they need to. The first reason why is that most spend their time social networking. The others are either buying things or playing games. Some of the people that are on the computers are wasting too much time being tech-saavy. It's other ways people can spend their time like biking or taking a brisk walk. Another solution is you can get up on you learning skills or find a job around you town. Computers drain and waste peoples minds everyday. I think it is essential for the people that can't get off seek fitness and mental health. Than again it could be legitimate reasons to be on the computers spending as much time as you want. The people that abuse the access of their computer too much should think and find something else to do. I think it'll be a good idea to have a time when the computers should be shut off one day or a week. By that I mean the cable/enternet company should turn the internet and the cable off for a week of pure exercise. That'll make people who are lazy to do something active. It'll also be a good motivator for people who are on the computer or watching t.v too much. Then it would make everybody fit and health if they try. I understand the elderly or senior citizens who need their computers for health help. That's understandable but everyone else should not be exempt. Computers and laptops should be network disconnected to make people get off their feet and do something helpful or brain building. Everyday people are being digitally sucked in. Some people in this world just can't get enough of it and it need to dead soon. The government should make a legal law that you must do something that will actively benefit you. It should be a person of the state or local towns person that goes to every house. Another way that could be done is by one person from every street in the state go home-to-home to make sure the procedure is being done. A lot of people are not going to like it and they will not obey the new law. It should be a penalty towards anyone that fails to abide by it. The second choice should be a loss of internet services. That'll make them really mad and in exchange they should still exercise. Sometimes it takes harsh laws to make somebody change.	4	4		8																					
776	1	"Yes, I do think that we should continue useing computers because it helps us stay in contact with other countries around the world, it forms a balance, and it also makes life simpler. First of all, computers help us stay in contact with the other countries around the world. Without computers we would not be able to @CAPS1 or evan video message other countries about important events. Sencond, we have to balance computers and excersing and interacting with just sitting on the computer but computers can help us interact with family and friends by emailing or video chating can also help you stay in contact. Last useing computers makes life simpler like how its so much easier to write an @CAPS1 and not a letter and its easier to instant message someone then to call them also for school projects you can make your project look so much better by adding pictures and diffrent fonts just hand writing it. That why arents arent a waste at time because they help us stay in contact with the other countres, they form a balance and it also makes life simplier."	3	4		7																					
778	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I don't know if I am understanding correctly but are you honestly thinking about not advancing technology? Quickly rethink that because that @MONTH1 just be the worst mistake you could ever make computers can tech hand-ey coordination, they can also give you very useful knowledge. Lastly, computers help us stay close to our family and friends. Fisrt off, about @PERCENT1 of people say that they use the computer every day so that they can increase their knowledge. This could ba as simple as going on @ORGANIZATION1! and discovering the latest news. This is ten times easier that going on the @CAPS1 and waiting for the news stone you want details on. I took a survey and @NUM1 students say that they use thier computer every night so that they can read more into thier social studies or science unit, @CAPS2 computer advances away is like @CAPS2 learning advances away, now is that what you want? Second, @PERSON1, chrildrens doctor states, ""Computers give children that hand-eye coordination they need to enhance in sports"" I agree! Sports such as baseball, soccser, and basketball all need a great deal of hand-eye coordination. Without the hand-eye coordination, students will not do well and end up quiting. I know that if I was having trouble with sports for a long time, I would give up! If the teens gave up sports then they would't have anyining to keep them fit one! that would lead to hundred of kids with on obesity problem. Lastly, @CAPS2 away the advancing in computers maens that you are @CAPS2 away family and friends connectionds. Computers offer many sites such as facebook or myspace o connect with loved ones. You can also go on @CAPS3 or sype to chat or video chat with them. Yes, maybe computers are @CAPS2 away time with family but what about @CAPS4 or @CAPS5 in @LOCATION1 that you have at to in over a year? Don't you want some time them too? You can make time limts for yourself so that you don't spend your whole time on the computer. This way you can took to all of your loved ones would you want to be the one crushing the oceans of a child that wants to talk/ see his grandparents? In conclusion, I remember talking and laughing with my friends over the computer when @CAPS6 sick so that @CAPS7 could cheer me up. Dont take that away from me! Keep enhancing computers so that I can advance my knowledge, increase my hand-eye coordination and get to see my far friends and family."	5	4		9																					
784	1	"Lies! The computers we use in society do not harm us in any way! They are a huge step forward for mankind and only benefit our lives. They benefit us greatly for the following reasons: computers are a source of knowledge, computers can aid the advertizment and buissness of many workplaces, and they are a very helpful and easy way to communicate with someone across the street or across the ocean. Without a dabt computers do nothing but benefit the people of our society. First of all, computers are a big source of knowledge. Many people @MONTH1 want answers to a question they have encounterned recently but cannot find the answers in a book or newspaper so they turn to a computer and immediatley their problem is solved. Computers today hold every bit of information on every topic imaginable from history to politics. All one has to do is find a site such as @ORGANIZATION1, type there question, and millions of answers pop up assuring a solution to the problem. Computers can also provide a place to research for a project or statistics of the economy if needed by school, buisness, or just for recreation. Times are changing fast and the sources of the worlds history and school subjects can easily be found in the corner of the internet. What you @MONTH1 have looked for in books and papers can be easily found on internet at the click of a button. Clearly, computers are a huge source of knowledge for our society. Second of all, computers and the internet support many buisnesses in advertising and making profit. Every single time a visit to the internet occurs many different buisnesses are able to advertise their products and overall buisnesses with pop-ups, side bars and websites. It clearly helps the workplace get attention. Along with advertising products buisnesses can even sell their products online without doing a thing. This can also aid the consumer because they would not have to drive all the way down to the store and pick up what they need. All they need to do is select the items they wish to purchase and await for its arrival a few days later. Clearly, the computer and internet can help support the welfare of buisnesses. Finally, the computers we use today are a huge and easy way of communication. Contact with people from another street, town, state, country, can be established by the use of social networking sites such as, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3. You could send a letter with the touch of a button with out having to make a trip down to the post office and await a reply. An instant message, which can be used on any of the sites mentioned can also be achieved. This is where you could write something down in the computer, send it to anyone and receive a reply within seconds. Obviously, computers play a big role in the communication of one to another without a problem. In conclusion, it is clear computers benefit the society greatly without a side effect at all. Computers are a good source of knowledge, an aid to buisness, anda great way of communication. Everyone as agreed to this without hesitation so you should too. Computers are the best things that have ever happened to our society today."	5	5		10																					
786	1	"Can you imagine how difficult life would be without a computer? I can I believe computers are helpful. Computers help us do research they keep us connected with friends and family and they are required to be used at some @CAPS1. The internet is a easy way to do research. All you have to do is search what you want information on and millions of articles will be at the click of mouse. Using the internet on a computer is much easier than going through books looking for something. That could waste a lot of time. The internet can quickly and directly answer your questions. Computers are a great way to keep connected. Almost everyone has a email now. All you have to do is type a few letters and you'll be reaqquainted with a old friends. When you call someone you can't be sure if they are busy or not. When using email the person recieving the email can reply when they howe free time. Computers are used at many @CAPS1. Sometimes you're even required to use it. Computers organize data by keeping documents in different files computers also have valuable programs that could help you in your career. Such as @ORGANIZATION1 word. Using a computer would aid you financialy. Some of you might think computers have misleading information. The internet isnt always a honest place. By spending a few minutes double-checking your information on other websites, your still spending less time than it would take to find the fact in a book. The computer is one of the greatest inventions created. It makes research connecting with friends, and your @CAPS3 easy! Use a computers @DATE1 and your life will be changed for the better.

790	1	"Wouldn't you say that having a computer in your house is helpful? It provides useful information to everyone. It can be used for personal use, such as for talking to friends. If there is a child in the house they might have to search something up on the internet for school. If you need directions to a place or you want to find out more about a specific person, a computer can help you. If you have a child who likes to run up the phone bill because they like to talk to their friends just tell them to use a computer! These are so many ways communication can be made through a computer such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and even email! If you need to make quick plans maybe for a movie with a couple of friends just send them an email or a message on @CAPS2. Now, an @CAPS1 you can text people right from your computer! If you're afraid someone might not get the email in time, just enter their cell phone number on @CAPS1 and a text. It's free too! Now that our world has become more technologically advanced schools often tend to tell students to look something up on a computer or maybe to do a homework assignment posted on their webpage. If a child does not have a computer at home this will. Make it hard for them to do their homework. Also, if a perent decides to start a business from have a computer would be required to cant up profits and to talk with customers. A computer can also make signs for a business or business cards. Need directions to a restaurant? Or maybe a local gym? A computer can help you find directions to almost @CAPS10 plan on earth. @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS11 is a reliable website to get directions. You can also learn about specific people if you type in their name in @ORGANIZATION1. If you need someone phone number but don't have a phone book you can use @CAPS12 pages to help you. So, now I hope you can see that computers effect people in a positive way. They help you keep in touch with friends and save you money. They help students learn more and could possibly help you start your own business from your home. If you need directions or help finding a phone number, a computer can help in multiple ways. Having a computer could make you have draw perspective of everything."	5	4		9																					
797	1	"Dear @CAPS1 post, Computers are an advance in technology, in a good way. They do benifit are society grately. Its a way that family members can keep in touch, it makes your life easier booking a flight and keeping a flight and tastly they help kids with school work. They can bring people together. Firstly, they are a great way to keep in touch. In my own expierence I have a brother at college and when I miss him or need to talk to him I can always send him an email or vidoe chat with him. Do you have someone, you don't get to see everyday? It can really make your family closer, because you talk more, with your realitives, and with friends. Friends more and go away but you can always chat it you need them. In a time of pain all you want is a friend. When the friends away, a computer probably helped our, too, just getting there. Booking plans without a computer would be a hasal, waitting on the phone for hours, at end, with computers you can do it all in all about five minutes. I have had a expierence when my plane was canceless but didn't know until, she went on the computer and checked. So she just switche are flight and we were off but could you imagine going the next day to find out that your flight was canceled and try all day to get on a flight and might not. With computers you can check every hour on the hour if you like. It well even say if there delayed so you don't wait in the airport for five hours. When it comes to traveling computers are a hesasity. Has that ever happened to you? Most likly. Yes once you were happy you had a computer. On the other hand, it also helps with your education. When class is over and your teacher is trying to scramble to get the homework out, mostly no ones listioning all they want to do is scat. About nine out or ten kids won't know the assignment when they get home that night. I know thats happened to me. As a eighth grader you probably did the of just forgeting all about and just taking the concerned. You could use your computer. Most schools use some or device, here at @CAPS2 he have were all are teachers post, grades, test/quizs coming up and homework. It's just one click away from every thing we need. It all right there, together. Most @CAPS3 kuchers will be a let happier if their kids come, in with there homework then without. Wouldn't you be? From school fund raisers to the lunch menu its all there. In conclusion, computers do help us from everyday use. to special uses. It helps use make are family stronger, help us keep are flight out and help us get homework, for school the next day. Computers are a help to the society, in a great and convienent way."	5	5		10																					
798	1	"I walked into my living room one night and saw my mom on the computer. I thought to myself ""she is always on that computer, doesn't she work to do?"". I said to my mom ""I think we should have an hour two of the computer each night, or not have one at all."" I told her that I think computers are a bad choice because you don't know who is on the internet and is trying to talk to you. Also, it gets in the way of exercising and spending time with family and friends. The internet/computers are very dangerous now a days. You never know if someone is a friend or a predator trying to get you. Say if you were talking to someone and you thought it was your friend, well you don't know for sure if it is then or not. I could be an older man or women trying to get a hold of you so they can probably kidnap you. Steal from you and worse. Now I watch the news and see many kidnapping because kids are talking to people on the internet and don't know who they are or what they look like. Like, when a girl was talking to a man and she thought it was her friend, turns out it wasn't and she got in a whole lot trouble. Maybe if she met him she would have gotten very hurt and be scared of that memory for the rest of her life. Family is very important to most families now a days. I have heard that spending time with family would bring your grades up in school because as you talk to them, you learn new things. Sadly this is not happening because people are so isolated to their computers they don't spend one minute with family or friends. I have a friend who is always on the computer. She never spends time with her family or friends. She is so focused on the computer screen then what is going on around her. Recently she has been getting off the computer and making more time with family and friends. Even her grades started going up because she spending more time studying with her mom and dad, then being on.... for example @CAPS1 or myspace and not getting any work done for school. In other words, she is very happy in life now and has changed from this experience she has gone through. Most people think you can use your brain for knowledge and call it exercise. That is one way to put it but it is not exercise for your body. People have spent more time having their eyes glue to the computer screen that they don't go out and play or maybe go a gym. The rate of obecity in our country is increasing for many reasons and lack of exercise is one of them because people spend to much time watching tv and being on the computer. I have a little cousin who is over weight and should be out playing sports and exercising. But does she, ""no""... She spends her free time on the computer in a stuffy room, instead of getting fresh air from outside. She keeps asking me how did I get and what age, and I keep telling her, I exercise and play sports so I can't tell you when. I keep saying that to her but she never listens. To this day she is still the same because she didn't take my advice to get off the computer and go outside to play. I strongly agree that we should have only two hours of the computer each night or have no computers at all. For kids saftey from bad people out there in the world, spending time with family and friends and finally for exercise and to stay fit with our bodies. I hope people understand what I say and take action to persue them in they own life and convice others too."	5	4		9																					
799	1	"Dear @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2, local paper @CAPS2 @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2 edioter of local @CAPS4 paper. I'm writing a letter to tell you about the effect of computer on people in a society. I think that computers help society learn and helps people to talks to others around the world. Computer help society learn about faraway areas of the world, to learn about the history of an area, and to study animals and habits unable to reach with out travel. Computer make @CAPS14 easier to learn about area that are hard to research like @PERSON1 and cliff of the @CAPS5 in @LOCATION1, @CAPS6 to learn about history of an area or cities of ancient @CAPS7 like @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION2 of @CAPS5. Help study animals species and the habits they could home like the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 or the hasin in @CAPS9 or the species call the @CAPS12 @CAPS13. Computer help society learn about all this. Computer also help people talk to other around world like you can hold a confeti on you computer when you are home, @CAPS14 is easier to talk and ask questin with others as you are on vacation, and you don't have to pay to travel to a place to have a confess with others. You can hold a confess on your computer from home when you can't make to @CAPS14. @CAPS14's easier to talk and ask question about something important to your business. You can go on your computer and talk with other people without spending money to travel there. This how computer help people talk with others around the world. This how computers help socity learn and talk to other around the world. @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2 edioter of local newspaper."	4	4		8																					
800	1	"Dear Newspaper, People use computers in their everyday lifes, & having computers has become customary to many people throughout the @LOCATION1. We go on computers for research, writing papers, or just for pure entertainment, in all these ways computers are very helpful. But, like all good things, too much computer time can be harmful. Sure they provide our lives with knowledge, info on the outside world, & connections with people from just about anywhere, but some of us become too attached with this virtual life instead of living our own real lifes. This happens to many people, some don't even notice what computers are doing to them. For most people, life @MONTH1 be challenging & the real world to stressing, so they retire to the computer for awhile, & to me this is fine, but when someone were to keep doing this it would become an addiction. Instead of relaxing by taking a walk or reading a book, they go to the computer, this would not be good for their social life or their minds. In my opinion, minds need to think, they need excerise by puzzling over something or figuring out a problem. Sure you think your brain is thinking by playing a challenging computer game, & sure, in some ways, it is. But it could reach its full potential by doing something else thats not straining your eyes so much. Computers can be good, but not for everything in your life. Now what about your social life Computers can be a helpful resource in many ways, but not if you let them become a destruction. This @MONTH1 happen by letting the computer be your constant companion. Now a days people have come up with online games where you can interact with other people. This isn't neccessarily bad unless your whole social life is only with these online people that you really don't know, instead of with real people that you see at school or meet on the everyday streets so what I'm saying is that a talking with people online isn't bad as long as you put them as secondary friends & have real people come first. Like I said in the beginning computers are part of our everyday life, and its not a bad thing, they can be very helpful. But you must control what you do on them and how much you use them. If you do that you will most likely have a much more balanced lifestyle. Making you, your friends, & family a whole lot happier."	5	5		10																					
801	1	"Dear Newspaper people, @CAPS1 you might heard on the @ORGANIZATION1 new, more and more people thing computers are the benefits of society. I personally agree with them. I think that theyare making people missing out of new things, missing out of meeting new people, and looking out on exercize. Time flys by fast. Things can fly over your head and you might not notice them. Have you ever ben on a computer for an hour. It might have felt you were on for @NUM1 minets. Many people ben on it for a hole day. You could of missed a year of stuff. New things like the new ipod nano with camra be invend and you would of not known. Also, the ipod. You could down load books andd read them on there. There also new things to try like jumping art of a plain or bungy jumpimg. You could be going to new place around the world. Traveling to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 or even under water. Even going to @LOCATION2 and having a melting, warm, right of the oven tayst cheese pizza. My mouth is grulling for just thinking about it. How many people do you know. What about on facebook or myspace. @CAPS3 not you should go to the park. Meet some people. Just going to a family house, you can be interacting. Everyone should be interacting with someone. Even two year olds need to interact with other two year olds. Thats they learn how to share @CAPS2, your not two anymore but its good to know someone. Learning how others think too. You @MONTH1 think your way in good and the other erson way is not. Thats called interacting talking about it. @CAPS1 you might see on news how many familys have someone in the familys having weight problems. Meny shows like biggest losers @CAPS3 it chanels are trying to help these people lose weight. But what cams this? It could be not eating right, or not excresing right. But the problem could do with computers. Many people are spending @NUM2 mins on the computer, than @NUM3 excersising. Just a quick walk around the lock can make you lose at leat @NUM4 callories. Other might rather stay on the computer and gain @NUM4 callories. And some deaths are around by a heart attack. This @MONTH1 caused by plack billed up or weight going. In sted of reaching for an apple many americans reach for that foods. I think we should still use computers but cut down the rtimes we use it and exercise and eat more. You might think after reading this letter. Thinking people wont lisen about excersing and meeting new people or palces. But, the one thing we can do is to at least insire one person. That person can inspire another person. This can go on and on. Little by little we can help people what they can do with out using an computer."	4	5		9																					
803	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that computers do not benefit society. They do more bad than good in my opinion. People aren't on the computer to research people. They are on to check @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5. They need to get outside and see the outside world, people should interact with family and friends. Humans that have to much on time on their hands. So their bored maybe they will make a @CAPS3 account or if they already have on then they will maybe one of the games on their and eventually you get addicted to @CAPS3 and you never go off of it. Our society needs to encourage people to get outside and only use your computer to check your email, add something to your ipod, and maybe check if you have any notification on @CAPS3. If you want to really have a great life sitting in front of the computer your entire life isn't going to let you have that kind of fun. Ya need to live your life like your going to die tommorow. Get outside, watch the big game with all your buddies. Go on a vacation get away with your family. Travel the world and rember every part of it. Wouldn't you rather be doing that then to be sitting in front of your computer? We need to inform our state about this problem. There is a reason why we are becoming one of the fastest countries! People are not leaving their house and not getting active. If people avoid their computers then we could be one of the fittest countries."	3	3		6																					
806	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion about computers is good. I think that they can help people with what they need. People can also also contact other people. All computers are helpful and not always something negative when someone uses it. Computers help teachers, students, employees, and parents. They aren't always for just helping. Computers can also be used for amusement. Games, music, and videos are always on the internet. Contacting other people is also a great reason why computers aren't bad. People can always have an e-mail for business and friends. Myspace, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 are all websites that people can contact others. Having a computer isn't always bad. When you do a story for the newspaper does it come out hand written? You also use the computer to do work. Computers aren't always bad. People have to learn to just limit their time. They can always be a positive affect on people when they need something. Information on anything is always on the internet. Computers have been used for decades and I think they will be used for many many more. Back then people used computers mostly for work. Now people of all ages can use it for all different kinds of things."	3	3		6																					
808	1	"Hello @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 you think computers are having a great effect on people? Well, I sure @CAPS3 think using a computer has a great effect on people. I say this because, people are probably waisting a full day on those facebook, myspace gol websites, looking up diffenitions for words, directions to places etc. If you think about it, this effect on people can ruin their eye-site, and social skills. These people are spending like @NUM1 hours tops on the computer. Staring at that @NUM2 inch little screen can damage your eye-site. This can lead you to getting glasses or possibly going blind. How would your life be without not talking to a girl/guy or even your own family? If you waist your time on those websites for example: facebook all you @CAPS3 is instant message the person. Maybe you should go out and @CAPS3 something fun with that person. What's this I hear about map it.com? Don't be lazy and waist @NUM3 minutes at your day just getting directions. Use a a real map! Also, free @LOCATION1? Come on! Use a real dictionary. So, I come to my conclusion by saying that these computers @CAPS3 have a ""great effect""on people. It gives them short cuts through life."	4	3		7																					
812	1	"some people learn about far away places, getting the latest up-dates on important news, and making sloppy work and hand writing seem nice neat. All those thing are some positive benefits people have computers. People all over use computers to research other places computers provide photographs of the place he/she is researching. For example: I remember when I had a social studies project on the @PERSON1, and I had to explain why its a great place to visit for its history. Mind I never even heard on a place called the @PERSON1 @PERSON1, but thanks to computers I googled ""@PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1"", then the computer gave me all of info. and photos about the mountain @CAPS1. Now I @CAPS2 where and what the @PERSON1 @PERSON1 moutans look like. Secondly, the computers has all the latest news happening all over the world. I remember when the earthquake in haiti first happened my grandmother had it happen until she got on line to check @ORGANIZATION1 and when, where and earthquake on the richter scale. about computers was a I wasn't the best hand writer in class, and could write it out or do it on the computer, plus we were getting graded on neatness, elaboration, and fluency. I choose to do it on the computer it came out nice and neat with picturs. computers has a very positive benefit on people world wide. now matter if its for info, news, or to make thing neates."	4	4		8																					
817	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A resent concern has built up among experts that computers @MONTH1 have negitive affects on the society. I do not agree with this. Computers ease life, teach you about faraway places and people, and finaly you can chat with others. I belive computers can only benifit a society. As previously mentioned, computers ease the hassels of life. With computers you are able to plan your life with @CAPS1 output. This program ables you to enter data on places you have to go and reminds you when time is done to that event. With this program you will never forget where you have to go. Also, with the computer you are able to gather information at extreamly high speeds. Supose you are doing a research project in school on types of cars, you just enter cars on @ORGANIZATION3 and get millions of results. this save much time than going on the librery and finding a book. This can take up to on how . Finally, with a couputer handy there are programs for special needs people to wright. New programs such as @ORGANIZATION2 word have a special function called voice commands. This lets a person who can not wright because of blindness or a disability speek to the computer what he or she wants to wright. In an istant it will pop up on the screen. Computer ease peples' lifes jarasticly. Besides esing lifes, computers teach you about far away places and people. pictures on a computer give one a first hand acount of how a far away place is like. Insead of just reading about it you can see it. Acording to time magazine if a person sees a place they will learn more by @PERCENT1 than reading an encyclopedia. As well as pictures, blogs give people an idea of how a person lives in a regular day in that place and how they feel about it. This is another first hand acount of the place. Finally, ebooks on the internet give you a large amount of information. Ebooks are books but in an internet format. These books inclued encyclopedias that give statistics and, pores, and events that are in the far of place. For example if you are planning a trip you can learn where to eat and where to get entertained. you can learn about far of places and people in them with computers. Lastly, with computers you can talk to people around the world. you can talk to friends. Have you ever moved and wanted to talk to a friend from where you previously lived? Now you can esily do so with video chat. Not ownly can you talk to someone you can see them. i remember @NUM1 years ago when I moved to @LOCATION1, I mised my friends in @LOCATION2 so i video chted them. As well as talking to friends, one can have a bussness meating around the world with out having to traval out of your town. For example if a company wanted to make a trading agreement with another company in @LOCATION3 they could do so with a click of a mouse. This will save time and money of travaling. Also you can talk to others online to get a feel of what happened. For example @CAPS2 a few weeks ago, video chated many people in @LOCATION4 to undersand now bad conditions were after earth quake. You can talk to people with ease with an computer availible. In conclusion, I believe computer are benifical to a society. They ease life, teach people about far away places and the people who live there, and alow people to talk to others. Computers open doors in the world. Computers help the society a great deal."	6	6		12																					
821	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I beleive, myself if, that computers are extreemly important to our society in this day and age. Computers help people talk with people. Online, and keep in touch with family and friends. Secondly, I think that computers are important is because they help with learning, even online schooling. Lastly, computers just help for the need of entertainment for people. Computers are one of the most used tools on the planet. Almost every family has one, some people even have more than @NUM1. Let's face it, there are many people traveling around the world, just trying to make a decent living for their families. Computers help them keep in touch, wheather it's by e-mailing them, or even video chat. This makes people happy, and still keeps them informed about what their family members, or friends are up to. For some people, it can re-unite family, by someone searching, I don't know, maybey their long-lost brother, or something. Computers keep families togetherm and you might just got a little surprise every now and again! My we should keep computers because we. Lastly, computers can just be plain fun! Maybe you're looking for some funny videos, just go on and search,""funny videos"", and it will keep you busy for a while. I know that I enjoy downloading music, too, so why should it be any different for other people? If there is a song going through your head, just look it up and I'm sure you'll find what you are looking for. You @MONTH1 be cooking and need a recipie for something, I am sure you're computer is more than willing to tell you whatever you please. All right, so, computers are one of the most important tools, of this world that we live in today. We depend on computers for many things, like keeping in touch with family, helping people learn things, and provide entertainment, just to name a few. Computers can help with countless things."	5	4		9																					
825	1	"Dear local @CAPS1, I think that computers are good for people to have. My first reason is kids might have to write an eassy for school. My second reason is kid might have to look important things up. My third reason is kids might have e-mails. My first reason is kids might have to write an eassy for school. Teachers mostly perfor to have the kids typ their eassys. When kids write eassy's they have to get information on what they are looking. My seocnd reason is kids might have to look important things on. They @MONTH1 have to fill out an alpaction out online when kids get older they want to look up schools they @MONTH1 want to go to. Kids in high school look up collages to get into when they are in like @NUM1 or @NUM2 grade. My third reason is kids migth have e-mails. When kids check their e-mails they are probably trying to see if their parents wrote them. Also some kids don't live near family so they e-mail each other on-line. My first reason is kids might have to write an eassy for school. My second reason is kids might have to look important things up. My third reason is kids might have an e-mail.

839	1	"Computers are one of the best advances in technology ever made. Not only are computers fun but they're also very beneficial to society. First off, comptuers are great way to communicate with other people whether it's instant-messageing, email, video-messaging, or services like @ORGANIZATION1. @DATE1, Computers offer many learning opportunities. There are thousands or websites with information about your search whether it be about simple things like how to bake cookies or even more complex searches like how many stars are in the sky. Last but not least, computers just simply make life easier by helping you with everday needs. To begin, computers are a great source of communication. I remember a time when my father traveled to @LOCATION1 on business. Because it costs so much money to pay for international cellphone service, my dad could not call using his cell phone. Instead, my father called using @ORGANIZATION1. It was great because it was right on the computer. Besides making live communication easier, computers also help to communicate news, weather few weeks ago, the the home was out. It was to shout the @DATE1, so my family had no way to. Since are than our cable provider, we were able to look up. School was indeed our computer, we world. Plus, computers offer more learning opportunities. Aside from being a great source of communication, computers are fantastic for searching and research. For almost all of my school assignments that required research, I've used a computer. Sometimes, you can even find articles from library books online. Some people say that the library is always the best place to find information but I disagree. More than half the time, the internet has beyond enough information for what I need. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say that computers answered their question better than any library book, did. Also, computers make life a whole lot easier. Computers make life so much easier. From typing to research to communicating and even to making travel arangements, computers help to make everday chores a lot easier. When my cousing was in highschool, she was assigned a @NUM3 word essay for homework. First off, it's pain having to count everyword and also, most importantly it's no fun having to write that much so my cousin decide to just type it. It saves time and is way neater. She finish her typed essay in @NUM4 hour while love friend finished in an @NUM4 @NUM4/2 hours because she hand wrote it. Its you on computers are esier. To conclude, computers are beneficial because they're a great source of communication, they offer many learning opportunities, and they make life so much easier. Thank you for reading, and I hope I've persuaded you to agree with my position that computers are one of the best advances in technology ever accomplished and why they are so beneficial to society."	5	5		10																					
841	1	"Dear local Newspaper, Computers don't take exercising, enjoying nature, and no interacting with friends and family away from you. Your family can sey time limits on the computer if they think your. Spending to much time on it. If you have time limits then people will have a certin time they go on and off of the computer. For example a child is on the computer @NUM1 and you can't get them off, time limits will stop that. The child is on a game and if the time limits are on, when your time is done the computer logs off automaticaly. That way your child can't get back on till thier next time. The computer can do many things you can play online games and chat with friends. Chating will let you talk to friends over the computer and you won't need to call them. Online games will still let you talk to your friends but you can have an avatar you can dress up and be creative with. For example an online game can let you chat make friends,"	3	4		7																					
847	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, "@CAPS1 not advance in technology?" asks four year old @PERSON2. There are countless reasons, people are spending way too much time on the technology we have already such as the computer. @CAPS9 of wasting time on this device, people arent excersicing, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with their friends and family. When you are on the computer for one hour, how many calories do you think you're burning? According to a study done at @ORGANIZATION2, one of the best colleges in the world, you're only burning @NUM1 calories. To maintain a healthy weight, you must burn at least @NUM1,000 calories a day! The average citizen in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 spends @NUM3 hours on the computer so that's @NUM4 calories. Even if they did aerobic excersize for the rest of the day, they couldn't burn enough calories @CAPS9 you can only burn @NUM5 calories an hour at the average aerobics class. If people can't maintain a healthy weight, they became obese, if they are obese they can get heart attacks, and if they have a heart attack, they could die! @PERCENT2 of the obese population in the @LOCATION4 die from a heart attack. With out a doubt, computers are like poison, if you use it, you'll get sick - but if you use to much, you'll die. Imagine - birds chirping up in the trees, deer sipping water out of a nice cold pond. In the distance, a fox playfully chases a butterfly. If you are in @PERCENT2 of @CAPS2 who have actually seen something like this with your own eyes you're lucky. "@CAPS3 fellow @CAPS2, I painfully state this fact. The rainforest in @LOCATION3 is being cutdown as we speak. This is @CAPS9 the @CAPS5 never go out and smell fresh air & see how beautiful the rainforest really is. We must stop them!" pleads former @CAPS6 @PERSON3 in an internationally televised speach. Too bad only @NUM6 out of every @NUM7 @CAPS2 could relate to kid message. @PERCENT3 of @CAPS2 have never gone out into nature. @CAPS9 of this, people are saying who cares about nature & the rain forest? "@CAPS9 of this, the rainforest is mercilessly being destroyed and animals are loosing their homes. When a pool was given to the @PERCENT3 of people who don't ever go outside to ejoy nature @PERCENT1 of them responded that it was @CAPS9 they are too busy spending time on the computer. The computer is a monster - it's killing our planet." I love @CAPS3 mommy. I @CAPS10 her everyday before dinner," sadly states eight year old, @PERSON1. Using computers kills time that could be spent with your loved ones, even if you are communicating with them on the computer. A @NUM5 year old cancer patient, @ORGANIZATION3 was on his death bed what he wished that he could change about his life, he answerd, "I wish that I didn't use the computers as much I got to know @CAPS3 family & friends better! @ORGANIZATION3 died lates that day. Do you want to carry around that heavy of a burden with you until your death? No, you don't. In a drug rehab the @ORGANIZATION4 asked the patients @CAPS1 they started drugs in the first in the first place, @PERCENT4 answered that it was @CAPS9 they didn't feel love by their families. After they answered, they were asked @CAPS1 they didn't feel love, @PERCENT5 of them answered @CAPS9 the people that they love were to busy on the computers. Unless you want to put one of your love ones' in the hospital do not use the computers. Obviously, computers are aweful technological devices. Yes, they do help with coordination, but would you rather be fast, not enjoy family & nature, but be able to catch a ball or be healthy, loved, and loving?"	6	6		12																					
851	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 studies have been conducted over the past few years, and they show that people of all ages spend @PERCENT1 of their free time on the computers. This is becoming a problem all over our state and country. Computers are consuming the lives of everyone. An anonymous source claims that they use their computer to contact old friends. A study shows that phone usage has gone down because adults and teens would prefer to email or instant message a friend. This results in sitting in front of a computer screen waiting for a responce. @PERSON1, a student at @ORGANIZATION2 says, "I go on the computer once or twice a week. i dont use it all that much because I'd rather be out having fun with all my friends rather than be holed up in a room by myself." @CAPS2 people believe it is a way to be more social, but it really isn't. It's just sitting in front of a screen talking to people you @MONTH1 not even know too well. When you sit down in your computer chair and start e-mailing away, you aren't doing any physical exercise. The @CAPS2 movement people will normally do is get up and go to the bathroom. Then they are right back in a chair, making minimal movements. @PERCENT2 of people who sit in front of a computer end up obese because they don't burn any calories. Since they don't relesase many endorphins, so they aren't very happy. If they got up and went outdoors to do physical exercise, they would be fit and happy . Often, teenagers feel more powerful when they are using a computer. They find it easier to disobey rules their parents set for them. Teens also find it easier to bully other children via the internet or social networks. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students at @ORGANIZATION2 middle @ORGANIZATION2 confess to being the target of malicious bullying online. @NUM3 out of @NUM2 confess to be bullied, and they definitely don't want to be bullied on facebook or myspace where everything is out on your profile for your peers to see. Teens should have limited time on the computer, so they don't do anything they will regret in their future. Therefore, adults and teens should be aware that using a computer is fine, but they shouldn't over use the luxury of a way to find information quickly or contact a friend in a foreign country. This generation needs to be reminded that their whole life shouldn't be spent on the computer. Probably less than @NUM5 minutes a day should be spent checking your e-mail or instant messaging a friend. Then you should go outdoors and spend time with your friends and family."	5	4		9																					
853	1	"Dear local news paper, Computers are powerful machines in our world. Most people east, sleep, and drink computer. Thats when those people are forty and live with there mom, for the most part of computer are used by teenagers and buiness workers. Computers are a tool that need to be used in an everyday life. We all know and remembe when we were ""sick"" just so we could go to the office with mom or dad to draw pictures and spin in the office chairs. Well while we were busy playing mom and dad were busy as well. They talked to their boss, made copies, had meetings drank coffee, and most of all they spent half of the day doing work on the computer. It could of been making spread sheet, designing logos, editing someones or getting new clients. About ninety percent of the workers use the computer to do their jobs. they need to be senting work to other companies over sea's or just down one float. Computers need to be used to do most jobs in @LOCATION1. Also the computers in today's time are beautiful because they have the internet. The internet allows use to talk to people around the world and look things up like the news, the close bridle shop, the biggest shopping mall, biggest race car tract near you and pizza placer near you. The inernet can let you do many things. I know that hear in granby you have to but the newspaper, but instead of but the paper you can just go on you computer and chechk the news. Look up the weather, the celebrity gossip, and where the plance crashed that you mom told you about. The computer can give you great information but only if you know how to use it. One thing that I find great is that you can watch tv. and movies right from your computer. Then you don't need to buy all those high priced chanles to watch movies. You can see you favorite shows and moves. A big thing is that teenagers span a majority of there time on facebook, twitter or myspace. Some of the advantages you get from these online sites is that you can chat with an old friend and show them a picture of you and your family. You can let people know what you are doing or tell them you sad because your dog died. You just can use the internet for just about anything. Lastly something you can do is buy music on the computers. You don't need to go out and spend @MONEY1 on an album, you can now just buy a single song for a dollar. You can buy many things on the internet the clothes on food. Thats why the computer"	4	5		9																					
858	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, I believe that we should tell the people of @LOCATION1 about the dangers of using computers too much. For example people who use the computer constently spend less time doing anything else in general. Also the longer you stay on the more you use it, and this habit forms a addiction, which might be hard to break. Finally people who always play video games on computers begin to lose terms of reality. Computers are turning this nation into a bunch of mindless slothes. If you have children, what do you think they do most of their lives. Maybe their going outside and getting exercise, or their brains could be getting sucked into a computer screen. Most kids by the age of @NUM1 have already used a computer for over @NUM2 hour. This shows that kids spend more time using the computer then anything else. I had a friend named @CAPS1 who used the computer @NUM3 and eventually he was so weak and scrawny from lack of exercise that you could snap his arm like a twig. Please, if you don't want your kids to be like @CAPS1, tell them to get up and go play outside. You probably think that using your computer everyday couldn't form an addiction, but computers can be as addictive as drugs. Scientest have found that using the computer everyday for one hour can be enough to form a addiction. In fact if we could scan people to find addiction @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION2 population would be addicted to computers. This means that @NUM4 years from now the world addiction to computers could be at @PERCENT2 or greater. Do you want to live in a world where almost everyone uses their computers @NUM3, I don't. Video games are one of the greatest advances in computer technology but also one of the deadliest. If you have a computer you will have video games. Small dosages can be fine, but non-stop playing can lead to serious problems. Because of the fantesy content people might start to lose sight of reality. For example, scientest tested a video game on kids, and now @PERCENT1 believe in zombies. Now they cannot ever play the game for it might cause serious brain damage. Just to make sure you get my point, let us recap. More computer means lack of exercise and social interaction, you can easily be addicted, and you can lose your sense of realness. I that you don't want to see you or your kids brillant brains turned to mush by computers."	5	4		9																					
859	1	"The innovation of computers was a great leap into discovery. Unfortunately, the negative aspects of this magnificent invention detract from the novelty. With the computer came a plague of not exercising and a disinterest in, perhaps even an inabilty to enjoy nature. On top of this destruction of the mind, this monster is the cruel cause of many declining relationships for who has time for friends and family while in the middle of an internet game? As unique and intriguing as the computer might be, it is slowly destroying the mind. Increasing interest in a monitor tends to result in decreasing care for exercise as well as a decline in the amount of exercise gotten each day. While playing on the computer, the mind @MONTH1 be racing but the body sits unmoving, @CAPS1 activity is being done. Indeed, for some the addiction is awful enough that the person only moves to get food, use a restroom, go to bed or when a parent demands it. All of the day's food settles into the stomach and little to none of it is burned off. Meanwhile, in some of the more severe cases the person is so entranced that bedtimes are pushed later. Sleep is essential to the body and mind and going without can be damaging. Nowadays the computer detracts from the sleep and exercise that the body requires. Even nature suffered from the advent of computers. Fewer people went out to admire its beauty. Nature is a wonderful teacher about the circle of life and the natural way of the world. Oftentimes parallels can be drawn between the wild and the tamed. Attached as people are to computers, they cannot experience the world to the fullest. Some argue that flora and fauna can be found online, but seeing a picture is different, almost cheating, compared to being beside the plant, able to study it from all angles rather than in an unmoving form. The experience is not the same. Also, computers are indoors, so the true world is chielded from view. Even nowadays with laptops if one was to be brought outside, the user would be focusing on the screen, not what is around them. Computers have severely cut down on the admiration of nature. Even family and friends suffer when computers are around. Many people barely pay attention to conversation while focusing on the screen. They tend to onlypretend to listen half the time. Even when chatting with friends online, the conversation is disjointed because attention is probably focused on another part of the internet. Frequently, during conversations without a computer nearby, the mind is focused on something from earlier that day. Relationships are suffering, and computers are at fault. Computers are sucking in society, more of it each day. Much of what is done on computers, like the study of faraway places, can easily be found in books. Computers have resulted in a lack of exercise, less time with nature, strained relationships, and a generally unhealthy lifestyle. Through all of this, they have returned little to society. Why does the world continue to put up with computers and their negative effect on humanity?"	6	6		12																					
865	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing a letter to you to explain why I think computers are not good to have. My three supporting reasons are that if you are on the computer all the time there's a chance that you might gain weight and becom obese. You would rather be on the computer than to hang out with your family, and lastly you won't have any friends to talk to. Please read on to hear my story. First of all if your always on the computer your not going to get up and go outside for a little because it won't be important to you. Also your going to have to eat and when you get exited your going to want to eat more. Then you'll start getting overweight because you don't want to exercise. Secondly, you would spend less time with your family. You would think that your going to hang out with them later. So then you play more and get addicted. So then you and your family would grow apart. And you would be lonely because you gave up your family just so you can play a game on the computer. For my last reason on this matter is that you wont have friends. I think you won't have friends because if your on the computer all the time you wont even bother to go to the park to play or go to the gym, to try to get into sports then you won't meet anyone. The only friends that you would most likely have is friends on the computer. That you will never meet in real life and won't socialize to the about there life and to hang out with. In conclusion I think it is not a good idea to have a computer because you can become obese, you will spent less time with your family, and you won't have any friends to talk to. I hope you enjoyed this letter and take it into consideration."	4	4		8																					
867	1	"I think that computers have a bad effect on people. I think that because of many reasons and I will tell you some of these reasons. One reason would be not get exercise going on the computer all day, you will only get worse. Say if you were @NUM1 years old and when computers come out you bought one and went on it every day instead of being fit. Then if you have no exersize then you will get bigger and bigger. Another reason if you would only use computers for research I say this because there is no reason to go on your computer all day a good reason to go on the computer would be if you have some kind of project for school or a job instead of just using your computer for facebook or myspace. Then there is some kind of diesese that can happen to your if it does the same thing to many times. Your dont want to do that because if you dont use computer that much and you play some kind of sport like football, baseball, or any other kind of around some place. Also if kind of surgery on it and that will cause you from doing almost everything with that one hand. My last reason go on the computer your viruses connected to it. If you do that then mabe your computer will lost everything on it. Then you have to get a new computer and everything all. If you bought a new computer and you got somebody can hack your computer and get all of the information from it. The information then they like how. And if you dont know person you dont know what they can do. So I hope you dont buy something that has a really bad virus else like that. Those would be all reasons on why you shouldnt go on the computer to much and why it does not really help other then when you are doing research or any other kind of work or job related way."	4	4		8																					
870	1	"Computers are a nice item to have but they are bad if you don't know how to control your time. Many people @CAPS3 days don’t get enough exercise and the lack of healthy people is costing the @CAPS1 tax payers millions. Also, people aren't enjoying life as much as they would if they didn't use a computers all of the time and thier are many people who have completely cut themselves off frfom their families and friends. I am positive that when you are done reading this you will be, one hundred percent pursuaded that the effects computers have on people are bad. To begin with, many people spend to much time on a computer instead of being outside or execising. This effect on people is something we need to start controlling because many people are very overweight and do not exercise enough to be healthy. Because so many are at an weight it is costing tax payers millions. For example, @CAPS2 @PERSON1 talking about healthcare, and anc easy sollution to cut the cost down is to have people exercise. More ofen in order to stay healthy. As technology to affect our lives, we used to remember that being healthy is more important than sitting on a computer all day. In addition to people not people dont enjoy life as much, You only live once and life is special, so why sitting all day? I many anymore because they spend all of there @CAPS3 are so many things to do in life that will bring you enjoyment than playing on the a computers. need to be and I can tell you that you life will not being you in enjoyable luife. Lastly, computers have made a lot of people when people got to Too many people a major view when it comes to family and friends. Although computers are an easy way to communicate to people, they should not be the anly thing you use to talk to friends and family. So as you can see, computers are causing us to lead on-healthy lives because our priorities on health are why to low. They also keep you from enjoying life, to the fullest and can separate you from friends and family when not controlled. I am positive that I have pursuaded you not to spend so much time on a computer. So next time you are using a computers, think of all the things you are missing out in life!"	4	5		9																					
876	1	"Dear local newspaper, I think your wrong!!. I totally disagree with this letter. People need computers to do research. Also helps us keep in contact with others. Another thing is @CAPS1 can get anything needed. First, @CAPS1 need computer. @CAPS1 need computer to help us with research. Instead of picking up a book you can go online. It's faster and easier. Also, You can look up information on any place or any project and it will help you. Thats the graet thing the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 has any information. Next, The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 web is also used for keeping in contact. For example, instant messaging. Also you can chat on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6. You can even go in chat room. But just keep in mind know who you're talking to because it might be a stranger. Anyways you can use the internet @CAPS7 an easy way to talk to people or to ""keep in contact"". Lastly, @CAPS7 you know the internet is used for research and talking but also for getting anything you want. You can go online and get pictures, games, videos, music or even directions to a place. Also the internet is used to just have fun. I use it mostly for ypoutube, @CAPS5, and for googling pictures. You can look up basicly any thing on line and it will most likely be there for you. In conclusion, the web is used for researching. Also for chatting. Finally for basicly anything you want it for. That is why @CAPS1 should have internet because you can still go online but have fun outside to. But maybe people should cutback a little on @CAPS8.V. Now do you see why I chose this side? Maybe in the future there will be a way to go on the computer but be active to."	4	4		8																					
878	1	"I think using the computer is great. You should heed my advice, people should be useing computers. Computers are an exelent way to comunicate. People can connect with others from all over the world. My dad moved to brazil so we have ben communicating via, @CAPS1-mail, @CAPS2, and even facebook. It’s the easyest and cheapest way to comunicate. If I call someone from a different country it would cost me way more but if I send them an @CAPS1-mail it’s cheaper. Studys from the university of @LOCATION1 show that @PERCENT1 people think its easyer and to use a computer to comunicate. More over you can do it instantly so it gets the information anywhere in milliseconds. Computers are indeed the best way to comunicate. Another thing computers are used I for as learning. Many people from around the world have learned diffrent languages from wed sites or programs that have great instruction and lessons. I learned to play guitar with maney programs and online lessons. Maney people depend on computers to get information and learn about things. My mom is a secretary at an inseurens broker companey. Without computers the coustemers couldn’t learn about the diffren policeys that there are and they misth be spending more money then needed on insearence. With out computer scientests couldn’t do much reasarch or learn about plants or rocks. Computers make it easyer for them to study and learn about @LOCATION2 and everything. Doctors wouldn’t be adel to do half of the thing they can with out a computer. They learn about diffrent sicknesses and broken bones by useing computers. @PERSON2 said she couldn’t be able to help out as many people with out the use and help of a computer she states that she learned @PERCENT2 of what she knows from websites that have in formation about the humin body. Even teachers say that they set better teaching skills from web sites. Builder and modern desiner @PERSON1 says he learned about different building designes that are sturdyer and stronge shapse he used this in his building today. I hope that you can how see how great computer are and how much they help our present day citizens."	4	5		9																					
889	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, Computers have great benefits to our society. Whether it is because it helps people get their work done. Or it allows people to communicate without telephone numbers. Maybe it's because it helps students study. With any of these reasons, computers are really benefiting our society. Have you ever had a paper assigned one day and due the next? If you think back what had helped you complete the paper? Most likley it was a computer. In a recent survey @PERCENT1 of college students say that they would not be getting the good grades that the were getting if they didn't have a computer. But, computers don't just help students, they can also help adults in the working community. I know that I have made friends over the years that have moved away and that I have lost touch with. With a computer it is easier to find those people and start talking to them. With different types of programs, you could most likley find anyone. Whether it's @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. Nine out of ten adults said that they found a lof of their highschool friends thanks to the computers. Furthermore, computers are a way for students to study. Students could find search engines and reasearch a paper. Or they could play educational games. With a computer if a student forgot his or her homework they could most likley use a computer to find out what the work was. When I went to the middle school to survey, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students said that they would check to see if it was on the computer before asking a friend. So as you can see computers have benifits to our society today. Three just happen to be that they help people get work done faster, they help keep you in touch with friends and they help students to study."	4	4		8																					
900	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am aware that some people think computers have a negative affect on others, but I think it's the opposite. Computers have completely changed the world. People can save work on them, visually experience things they've never seen before, or even catch up with old buddies. In my opinion computers have a positive affect on people. With computers you can create documents, pictures, and even movies that will stay on your computer forever. How about your newspaper company? Does somebody hand write every paper that comes out? Without computers hundreds of copies of your newspaper wouldn't be able to b made every day. Not to mention, what would happen if you didn't use computers and a fire occured? All of your hard work will be turned into ash, but if it was on the computer you be able to retrieve it. You can save anything on a computer. Another reason why computers have a positive affect on people is because throught the internet you can visually experience places or things you couldn't before. If I was going to book a vacation I wouldn't just trust a book, I would wont to go on the computer so I could see pictures, videos, or hundreds of other articles I couldn't see anywhere else. This goes for anything else like furniture, instruments or even cloths. Computers offer alternative views that books don't. Not only can computers save data and give you visuals, but they give you an oportunity to catch up with old friends, relatives, or even meet new people! Instead of endlessly searching through phone books you can just type in their name and you bound to find somewhere on the internet. Popular websites like @CAPS1 make this extremely easy. When my dad was in search of his childhood friend he typed his name on @CAPS1 and ended up calling him @NUM1 minutes later! That wouldn't have been possible without computers. Computers truley do have a positive affect on people everywhere without them many things today wouldn't be possible. Hopefully others will agree with me too."	5	5		10																					
906	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, I want you to imagine it's a beautiful @DATE1 day. The birds are chirping, the smell of beautiful flowers are filling the air, but instead of playing outside with your neighbors, you are inside trying to master the unbeatable game cubefield on the computer. Computers have had a negative impact on today's society. When people are engrossect with whatever they @MONTH1 be doing on the computer they become very lazy, they lose the motivation to go out and exercise, people also lose intrest in helping around the community. This is why computers have a negative impact on todays society. Statics shows that @PERCENT1 of people would rather stay instead on the computer then out and about helping and working around their neighboorhood. Computers have had such a negative impact it makes people want to stay glued to their chairs with their eyes glued to their monitors. Yes computers have had a lot to do with a lot of technical advances, but at what cost do these technological advances come? Many kids are becoming obese and lack my motivation to come out of their room off of the computer. Computers are making society very lazy this is why they have a negative impact on us. Computers have also made society lack motivation to go and exercise. A very close family friend was very obese. She was lazy and never wanted to exercise. Instead of going out and doing something about it, she stayed in her room on facebook for weeks at a time. Though the computer wasnt the one who made her obese, it was used as a much to hide behind the real problems. It is sad when @PERCENT2 of teenagers say they would rather stay inside on myspace than going outside for a jogg. Yes its true computers helps you learn things you @MONTH1 not have known before, but so do books, newspapers and magazines. Computers have had a negative impact on society. Helping out in your community provides many opportunties to meet new people, and it feel a sense of accomplishment. But the urge to stay in on the computer clouds your better judgement. I know that I would rather help the elemntry school across the street build a new garden rather than stay inside on twitter. If you are inside searching the web how will you know if the old lady across the street needs help with her groceries? Helping around your community lets people know you care about whats going on. So dont let the computer have another second of your time. Computers have had a negative impact on society. Teenagers as well as adults have become very lazy. They lack motivation to exercise as well as help around the community. Now its your turn don't just stare at your computer screen absent mindley. Go out and toss the ball along with the neighbors dog. Youve heard the facts now make the right decision."	6	5		11																					
911	1	In my opinion I think that computers have a good affect on people. I think this because about millions of people use computers everyday! The affects on them are that people get learn things easier. There are millions of a job sites that would have to do with something of learning. About @NUM1 of collage students go online and do challenge. If you were a collage student and did collage online you would: see your family more won't be a hassle to get to collage and would be easier to concentrate being by your self and learning. Also they even make stone which is very popular learning a different language and where you learn this from is on a computer. My second reason is to talk on the . About @NUM2 of our daily! Online phone you and you can also the cool them even more that have you talk to give . I know have a facebook give don't get think it would be a good chore. up free. So in conclusion I think that there good effects on people that use cpu. Also when everyone that uses their cpu they still enjoy the nature talk to thier family . So if you don't have a cpu you get one and will do other fun stuff you like.	4	4		8																					
918	1	"To who this @MONTH1 concern, In my opinion, computers have greatly improved our lives. Therefore I believe that owning and using a computer is for the greater good. Three reasons that support my decision are that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily, they allow us to connect with people in far away places, and they help us to learn more about life and the planet we live on. Please consider my reasons when making your decision. My first reason is that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily. This in turn allows us to get more done. For example lets say that your doing a report on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You could run out to the library and look through hundreds of books and newspapers or you could just sit down at your at your computer, open up a web browser, and type a ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" into the search box. Within a few seconds you will have searched hundreds more libraries newspapers and even other computers to find information on your topic. You can also look for information on videos. Old newscasts, inteveiws, documeteries, you name it. It's all there right at your fingertips. My second reason is that it allows people in far away places to connect. If I said that to my mom she would probably tell me to go use the phone, but computers can do everyhing a phone can do and more. You ca share photos, videos, games, just about anything. Recently, I joined facebook and I now can talk to people I haven't seen in years who moved away I was born. Over the @DATE1 I had gone to my @CAPS3. My dad introduced me to his uncle who shared the same name as me. Then about month's later I got a friend request from a @CAPS4 who up in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, which is far from where I live, and now lives in. After talking to him for a while I learned that he was, the son of mydaduncle. If it weren't for my computer I would have never met him. Also,I recently learned and am getting pretty good. So one day my friends look me through a which has all it,. We began video taping a posting. So the computer has also allowed us to what without them having to be there. My third and final reason is that the computer allows us learn how to improve our lives and the planet we live on. Many people say that if you on the computer all the time you'll become fat and lazy,but that isn't always the case. I have actually been able to improve my exercise rutine byuseing the computer. Whenever I go out for a run, I can come home and find out exactly how far I ran, how many calories I burned, and anything else I want to know. I have also been able to find new more effective excersizes that allow me to target different muscles. Now lets talk about what we can learn about our planet. We can use a computer to find weather patters which allows us to plan our days accordingly. We can also use it to learn about news happening around the world. For example, the day of the earthquake in @LOCATION2, I opened up in my homepage and there it was and I was able to learn about what had happened. Finally a computer allows us to learn different cultures around the world. We can learn about how ancient egiptions lived, how the people in @LOCATION3 or @CAPS5 make money or how they construct their houses. All the things we would never know if we didn't have a computer. In conclusion, computers have improved the lives of the human race by a great deal. They have allowed us and how to improve our lives. I hope that this letter has helped you come to a decision about the effects a computer has on people lives."	5	5		10																					
920	1	"Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 you know what computers are doing to the people of the @LOCATION1? Well I @CAPS2. People are on the @NUM1. We need to @CAPS2 something about these computers. They are preventing people from exercising, going outside, are are just making them stay in there house all day. One reason I think we should get rid of computers is because people aren't getting there exercise. the computer, next to the @LOCATION2, is probably the number one thing that makes people fat. Kids are sometimes on the computer all day eating snacks and junkfood when they should be eating healthy fruits and vegetables. You could. Almost @CAPS2 anything on the computer that you @CAPS2 in your everyday life, that's how good technology is. The computer is the thing that gets people addicted to something. The computer has games, internet, and ways to talk to people that get then attached. A second reason is that computers just keep taking money out of your pocket. When you buy a computer most people just buy the most expensive one, because the salesman talks then into it. Most people don't know what kind of computer they are supposed to buy, so they buy the most expensive one because they think the more, the better. Also just buying the computer isn't all of it. When you download softwares, games, and moble things that all cost money. Downloading one thing can cost up to one hundred dollors. plus, most people can't afford these downloads after buying themselves a pricy computer. My third opinion is that the computer is just a complete waist of time. People spand hours on the computer doing stupid stuff, like playing games and talking to the, when they should all be outside enjoying the fresh air. Going outside is very important to your health. Next time your on the computer doing something that doesn't need to be done, go outside. Think about it, hour often @CAPS2 you go outside? My guess, not much. Now @CAPS2 you know what computers are doing to the people of the @LOCATION1? They are making people fat, not getting there exercise, eating junk food and play games all day long on this stupid piece of technology. Instead of being on the computer all day why don't you think about going air you need. Also you don't want to be waisting all of your hardworked money on a stupid piece of technology. Plus, you don't want to deal with softwares and there viruses. My advice, computers are terrible."	4	4		8																					
926	1	"I believe that people spend too much time on the computers. If people spend hours on the computer it will result in bad eye sight. They don’t get enough exercise.most teens aren't getting home work done because of this @CAPS1 people sit on the computer for countless hours their eye sight is slowly going bad. The bright lights of the screen make your eyes unclear state say more people lose eyesight from looking of a computer than they would by staring at a light. Sitting down in front of the screen you aren't down in front of the screen you arents getting any exercise. You mostly just move your hands and fingers. If people dont exercise for at least @NUM1 minutes a day, we will all become week. Lastly, your teenager probably do their homework. while they are in his or her room they've most likely all the computers. if they spend too much time on the computer they are more likely to fail their classes. which means they will most likely stay back. In other words, people spend too much time on the computer. If we continue this most people will lose eye sight. if citizens keep sitting there then we will became unhealthy. And lastly, more teens want do homework and wont succeed."	4	3		7																					
933	1	"Dear Newspaper, In think that computers are not good for the society. There are three reasons why I think this and these are the following; @CAPS1, people don't get to spend time with their family. Second, you can get misspell words using instant messenger. When your doing your homework you can get distrated by the computer. The @CAPS1 reason why computers are bad for the society is because people don't spend enough time with their family, I know I don't. I spend at least half my day staring at a screen when I could be outside walking my dog with friends. Furthermore, instant messenger is the most addicting. When I type something, I use abreveations for any word. The professor at @LOCATION1 says at least @PERCENT1 students spell abreveated words in tests. For example, if you wanted to spell ""what"" instead the @PERCENT1 would spell ""@CAPS2"". Finally, my last reason why I think computers are not good for society is because you can get distracted by it a lot. I know that because I am driven to the world of computers. When ever I do my homework. I can't keep my eyes off the screen. Therefore explains that computers are not good for society. In conclusion, computers keep you from spending time with your family, has students misspelling words, and distracting you from doing your homework. I hope you agree with me on this."	4	4		8																					
935	1	"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, Are computers really as great as they seem? It seems to me that they are used way too much in people's lives, and that computers are distractions that don't allow people to di ceratin things in their life that they would if they weren't always on the computer. People's lives are starting to revolve around going on the computer, checking your facebook, and looking at new videos on @CAPS2.com. I know from experience facebook or myspace can be very addicting. I'll spend hours commenting on pictures or new wall posts, and then at @NUM1 pm I've realized I haven't begun any of my loads of homework. This happens quite often, and I end up staying awake until around @NUM2. The following moring I wake up at @NUM3 am, exhausted. I am not exaggerating either, this happens to many of my friends, and if you have kids, ask them because I am @PERCENT1 sure they are on facebook or @CAPS3 all night. This doesn't just happen with kids either, my mom just got a facebook and she is hooked to it, even more than I am. Sometimes it can be come a competition to see who has the most pictures, or the most friends. Kids start adding people as friends that they don't even know computers aren't just distractions, they are also very dangerous. At my school we had assembly where they showed us how easy it was to find out someone's personal information, Even if you don't have your address or your phone number listed, there are many other ways to track you down. If you take a picture right after you won the championship soccer game, in your jersey. Just that one picture shows your team name, your last name, and your number. Anyone could easily search all that stuff on the internet and know exactly where your next game be. As the local newspaper @CAPS1, I am sure you must be concerned about the safety of the town, or even your own kids. Some people @MONTH1 say ""that would never happen to me"" but it easily could, especially if you're constantly on your computer. I have noticed that a lot of teens around my age are starting to become obsessed with being on the computer. A lot of times in families, instead of spending time together. syblings are fighting over who gets to go on the computer. One sybling @MONTH1 need it for homework, while the other just wants to talk to her friends on @CAPS3 and each believes they deserves the computer. Computers are starting to interest a lot with people's lives, in a negative way. Once again they are distracting, dangerous and hurt families. Computers hurt society more than it helps. And maybe you should look into how much time your kids are spending on the computer. "	4	5		9

One much life is exercise, and due to the of modern computers, exercise is the key to a healthy life. Personally, I know at least poor young children in my very school that are a victim of the cruel disease, known as obesity. The reason for the dese children is quite simple-they over use, and forget the natural bounderies to using something. Practically every day, each of the foor heart- children begin to their computers from the second will home, to the moment they fall asleep. this outrageous number of hours the vital the to exercise, therefore allows their bodies to adopt to the habits of the children sleep, eat, computer. This upselling manor of the foor kids enables others to pick on them for being fat, yet they can't fight back, they have what so ever, thus the over use of computers can result in a over weight child, with no exercise, and no power/ muscle to depend themselves from.

941	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 computers benefit our society has been a hotly debated topic among citizens in our town. Many argue that computers provide quick easy communication, help children and adults learn, and even teach balancing habits to our generation. I firmly believe that computers are necessary in our society. "@CAPS2, @CAPS3! I miss you!" are the words @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1-year-old @PERSON1. @PERSON1 has been working overseas for two years in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3. One @ORGANIZATION1 the only ways she can contact her father is through @ORGANIZATION3. Communication is extremely important in our society; it brings families and friends closer together. Computers provide a variety @ORGANIZATION1 forms @ORGANIZATION1 communication, such as @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS5, and instant messaging. "@ORGANIZATION3" allows people to have what can be called a "visual phone conversation." A teary-eyed @PERSON2 says, "@CAPS4 since @CAPS7 wife died, @CAPS7 daughter has been @CAPS7 only companion. With @ORGANIZATION3, I can not only hear her voice every day but see her face, too. It never fails to make me smile." @CAPS5 and instant messaging also give out society fast, easy communication with others. Invitations, announcements, and just a quick "hello" can all be done by @CAPS5. Therefore, computers are very important for communication in our society. Have you @CAPS4 seen the look on a child's face @CAPS10 he/she learns something new? Computers provide an excellent variety @ORGANIZATION1 education in our society. For example, toddlers and children can use programs such as @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS6). @CAPS6 programs teach reading, writing, and speaking to children. "@CAPS7 child used @CAPS6 @CAPS10 he was a toddler," says @PERSON3, a @LOCATION1 resident, "and now his teachers are so impressed by his reading and writing skills. I couldn't be more proud." Computers don't only teach children; they teach adults, too! Did you know that adults learn @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 their knowledge about the environment, politics, and other basic information from the computer? Computers are needed to help people learn in our society. Finally, computers teach balance. A @LOCATION1 mom says, "@CAPS7 teenager @PERSON4 has learned how to balance computer and life, and I can definitely see how it connects to other areas @ORGANIZATION1 balance as well." @CAPS10 teenagers learn to balance their computer time, they also learn how to balance, extra-curricular activities in school. This shows, as a result, that students actually learn responsibility from computers. I hope that our society will consider the fact that computers are necessary. @CAPS10 they provide commonication, teach education, and help kids learn how to balance, what do we have to lose? Computers can most certainly improve our society."	6	6		12																					
942	1	"Dear local newspaper committee...., I am writing to you, about how there is a substancial dilemma within the concern of computer use. From my data that I have collected, computers are both somewhat good, and bad. But I believe that there are more reasonable ""@CAPS1,"" toward computer use. In my opinion, I state that computers are quite addicting due to, addiction of computer, loss time of exercise, and how computers @MONTH1 ""help,"" one in obtaining the loss of their social enviorment. Computer @MONTH1 seem helpful but of @ORGANIZATION1 they are a great way to research for @ORGANIZATION1 reasons. But there is also the choice of books for research. Computer use has risen to a substancial crisis line, because they are addicting. An example is the well-known link called, ""@CAPS2,"" @CAPS2 is a place where you can socialize. But when your child has a @CAPS2, and they are on the computer doing ""homework,"" there is a @PERCENT1 that they will end upon @CAPS2, than rather doing their homework that important information was found at an @ORGANIZATION1 @DATE1. Computers are addicting also because of online computer games. Computer games online can be fun, but are a complete waste of time for you electrical bill, and @ORGANIZATION1 purposed of you child. Computers are very addicting in terms of @CAPS2, and online games. Computers are somewhat good, but are very to you health. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 has increased their weight, due to videogames and computer? Computers are horrible when it comes to this topic. Overtime, you begin to gain weight by spending more time using the computer and less time working out and staying fit. This also revolves around addiction, by using the computer over a large period of time. In the end, computers are a harzardous topic, when it comes to working out, and staying in shape. Computers are terrible and horrified when it comes to friends. Friends are people who spend time with you and interact with you. But computers see it a different way. by using computer for a long period of time, you begin to think how computers are all you need. Soon enough, your friends will leave you because you don't care about them, and forget them. This also revolves around addiction. By addiction, you lose your friends and you damage your social enviornment. Computer @MONTH1 seem ""fun,"" but are defuliated when it comes to friends. In the end, I beleive that computers are a waste, because they are addicting you become very unhealthy and they strive to damage your social enviornment. With the facts I have stated, they have supported my reasons. Computers are not the way to go. So, try books."	5	4		9																					
947	1	"Dear Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1 has an essay due on plants for science tomorrow. She was absent @DATE1 and didn't know about it. If she had a computer, she could go on to the website and check, but she doesn't. The town took them away. Another student, @LOCATION1, is working on the same essay. Her handwriting is terrible so her teacher will not be able to score it. What are they to do? Although many some say that computers are not good for society, most know that life without computers would be a disaster. New @CAPS1 is currently thinking about taking away computers in our town. This would be a big problem for everybody involved. One reason is that people need it to get information from search engines like ""google"" and ""yahoo"". They also use the internet for communication like ""facebook"" and ""aim"". Taking away computers would drastically impact every day life. Society computers to get information. I know that whenever I don't know something I just look it up online. If I didn't have this resource, my homework would not be as detailed as it is with the computer. Another example is that public look up information about the world on my computer. When many heard about earthquake in @LOCATION2, they could pull up information within seconds. This led to many bake sales and fund raisers. Lastly, when kids miss their favorite @CAPS2 shows one day, they can just look it up the next day to get caught up. This is a big part of teenager life. Society needs computers in order to look up crucial information. Many people also use the internet for communication purposes. I know that in my family ""e-mail"" is what makes it all work. My mom makes all her plans by email and sometimes even e-mails herself from work to remember things. Without it, our family would not be able to function. Another mode of communication is ""facebook"". Any time my friends and I have a question about anything anything that happened that day. We will ask each other on this website. It is safe and saves all the trouble of calling on the phone. A final example is ""aim"". This is a messaging tool that lets you talk instantly with friends and even see them with ""video-chatting"". My friends and I would not be able to show each others outfits and other items without ""aim"". Teenagers as well as adults need to communicate through computers. In conclusion, society needs computers in order to look up info, as well as talk with friends and co workers. Do not even think about "	5	5		10																					
948	1	"I am so happy, I just finished my school report on @PERSON1 and I didn't even need to leave my house. I was able to talk with my classmate and ask her questions online. I also managed to get all the information just from my computer. I also learned how to row a boat, to show my class how @LOCATION1 crossed the @CAPS1 river, I learned that by taking on online course. This is one situation why computers have fantastic effects on people in everyday situations. Local research show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 planning their vocation use the internet. The reason these citizens use internet is to get the information about the hotel and vacation cite. That is one way that makes computers helpful and positive devices, beacuse it makes it easier for busy @CAPS2 to get ready for a trip by looking at pictures of the hotel online and getting all the info they need. Doctor @PERSON2 of @CAPS4 university says ""computers now offer programs that allow busy @CAPS2 to learn a new skill, @PERCENT2 of @CAPS2 currently use this software. ""@CAPS7 everyday @CAPS2 don't have time to go out a join a group or class to learn new skills. That is why computers are so helpful and people just love them. Instead of leaving home they can be cooking, doing yoga, or speaking a new language all from their computer at home. That is another reason why computers are useful in vey positive ways. Imagine forgetting your homework at school and not be able to an A in that class. Well because of computers forgetful students can talk to a classmate online and get the homework and do it. Or they could even use the internet to go to that school website and find the homework and print it out. Many students around the country forget homework once in a while, because of helpful computers they can fix their problems easily. Let's recap, students or adults can get information off the internet for projects or even vacations. Busy @CAPS2 who don't have time to leave their house can take a class or learn a new skill right on the computer. Anyone can use the internet to talk or chat online to get school work or to long distance friends. That is why the effects on computers to people are nothing but positive. Now what can you do? It is important that computers stay in our lives, they are helpful and we have learned to live with them, which is why they must stay. This benefits you because newspaper houses are organized by computers and it keeps you business running."	4	5		9

With a computer you can do home work extra fast, no having to go to the library to look stuff up. Computers also allow you to take out anger on ones and zeros. Muny experts like @ORGANIZATION1 think people will talk to stranger on website like facebook and myspace. If parent place him son the websites and also make it so only freinds can you profile you will be alot safer. Comunications engineer @PERSON1 says that it is better for people to talk from it online than not I know he is correct because I have relatile in the @LOCATION1 that I love talking to but they are @NUM1 miles away so communication is or I to get, then I got a facebook and it is like they are next door. @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 says that @PERCENT1 of strangers that are molestores/ thugs go, after, people who don't protect their profile so protect your profile and be safe. Computers are better than going to the libra! This is there because going to the library means you have to round up the kids get in the cor and go. With a computer you can just go into your office and do re search, That saves money or gas. If you have a prodject of you can just send it straight to they teacher. In many today experts like @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION2 a conducting experiment that are rigged. Violence they say is cursed by the games but they use test subjects like an the bad people you dont want to meet. I Have found video games to be a great let out for stress biut up during the day. Muny of my friends have also found this. Video games make you think that is also reason they are good. In conclusion computers are exelent. They make it so ther is the ability to communicate with friends alow you to take out anger. What is not to love? Get a computer now!!"	4	4		8																					
950	1	"Each year the world becomes more and more advance in technology. Technology helps and benefits us all in a good positive way. Computers are apart of this positive technology and definetely benefits society. Computers help us look up places and things we never seen before and teaches us about them, too. In addition, computers have a positive impact on families and benefits them greatly. Also, they help people from adults years out of college to teenagers in high school communicate with their friends. Therefore, computers help us all in some little way and makes life easier and more fun. To begin with computers helps us expand our knowledge. It us helps us look up facts or recent news quickly. For example, just recently the @DATE1 @CAPS1 occured and they usualy go late into the night so I didn't get to see the whole competition. I could just easily go look it up on the computer to see who won which medals. computers helped me by looking up the medals quick so I woudn't have to wonder who won a medals not. Computers help us expand our knowledge all the time. They help us look up facts for report, places we want to travel to, learn about the benefits of a certain pet and the posibilities can be endless. to continue with, computers help families by bringing them closer in a way. A family member could be watching a funny on youtube or @ORGANIZATION1 and could think its so funny that they want their whole family to see it you. In addition, stores sell clothes online now so mother and daugther can sit down together and shop without leaving the house. Computers bring my family together by we rent movies from @LOCATION1 on the computer. It brings us together when choose and pick which movie to rent. Also, it brings us together to have a family movie night. As a result, these things the computer gives brings out discussion in the family and gives a good topic that everyone can relate to and talk about. Another way computers are beneficial is they bring everyone together. There are many ways communicate on the computer these days. There is facebook, twitter, email, aim, and many more. They are all different, but they have one thing in common is to bring old friends and new friends together. For instance my mom just sign on to be in facebook so she can talk to all her old friends from highschool and she found one really good friends who she hasn't seen in ages it made her really happy. Therefore, it shows that computers aren't just for bringing new people together, old ones, too."	5	5		10																					
959	1	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the affects of computers is that while there are good benefits that come out or them, I believe more strongly that negative issues and situation arise from computers and that they affect people with greater impact in a not so good way. @CAPS1 three main reason as to why I think there are more negative impacts than positive and constructive impacts from computers are @CAPS2-bullying is a very big issue. Also there are many 'scams' and 'cons' out there on the @CAPS9. Lastly there is a lot of mis-leading or wrong information online. Going back to @CAPS1 first reason, ""@CAPS2-bullying."" @CAPS2-bullying can be derined as rude or nasty teasing over the @CAPS9. On social networking websites such as @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and so on. '@CAPS2-bullying' can include teasing, hurtful comments horrible name-calling and fowl language. It is much more effective than regular bullying, such as ""Give me your lunch money"", because once you put words out on the @CAPS9, you can never take them back, no matter how hard you try. '@CAPS2-bullying' is the new generation of mean. Secondly, scamming and cons come out of the @CAPS9/computers. When purchasing items online, you never really know what your going to get. @CAPS1 father was scammed, or connect on the @CAPS9. He was looking on what seemed like a very official site to purchase a big boat. He drove all the way to @LOCATION1 to get it. He took it out on the water in @LOCATION2, at our @DATE1 home, and the engine and motor were broken. That is what can happen when buying something off of the @CAPS9. Lastly, mis-information can be another negative impact from computers. When researching a topic, you should stick to the library, it @MONTH1 sound old-fashioned and slow, but when you research on the @CAPS9, you need to remember anybody can put or post anything, even mis-leading or untrue statements and 'information' online. Researching topics is not the only way to get false information. People can pretend to be who they are not in real-life, which is why ananymous chat-rooms and instant messaging are dangerous and un-reliable. As a conclusion, the @CAPS9 basically has stronger negative impacts and consequences than positive ones. Because @CAPS2 bullying, scamming or conning and mis-information are all negative factors of the @CAPS9, and out-wiegh the positives."	5	4		9																					
961	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, Have you ever found yourself thinking about the computer, or wishing you were on it? I heard you were looking to see if computers have negitive or positive effects on society. I feel that it is a negative effect because of less time exercising littele time with family or friends, and is very it's easy to became addicted to. Exercising, a very important thing for a healthy body and mind @CAPS1 have a hard enough time finding time to do this. So instead of that free time to exercise, they will probably be on facebook. Also the maintenance of the computer will take away time for exercising. Just @DATE1, my computer got a virus I had to get fixed and that took for ever. That time while I fixed it could have been valiuble exercising time. Another key point to look at is obesity. We should be up and moving not just setting and staring at a computer for @NUM1 hours at a time. I love to spend time with my friends and family. I mean who doesn't right? Computers only away from that kids well be on facebook instant of eating a nice meal with thier family. My @CAPS2 always told me stays of the (and stupid) things he @CAPS2 with his friend. Now wkids just @CAPS3 easy. We will never have the social our parents I feel if is very important to spend time with and family because you never find when your going to lose them. Addiction is a serious matter. being addicted to the computer is too. Our generation is so dependant on computers. For example, in the car with the @CAPS4. You just plug it in and it ells you where go. What happens when it braker? You will have know idea where to go because you never learned how to read a map. or what if your computer brakes? You will have to send a better by mail kids had be typing instead of writing. that skill would be lost and you would have to learn it again. As you can see, addition is a no laughing matter. Once again I must streach the negative affect of computers to. "	4	4		8																					
966	1	"Dear the daily newspaper crew, I have seen some of your own disagree about using computers. I for one believe that using a comenter really isn't that bad. For example, the computer is actually good for education. Many use them to create @NUM1 images of things for schoolprojects or science fair projects. I use these machines to play video games on to cure my boredum like most young teens and children do. Unlike most people I dont stay on it forever. I usually play for a couple hours. There are some downsides to having computer in the house. For one the machines use up load of energy in the house making the electric bill rise and @DATE1. On some websites there are people who try to be a stalker like the website my space and twitter but on the bright side these who try to be a stalker usually instantly get caught and put in jail. Computers actually have a positive effect on the mind and movements. For example children who have computers learn how to fly a kite or for themselves with their parents watching and they learn hand-eye. Many children who play sports that have computers actually manage to catch a ball faster than usual. So you see computers are not that bad. So please think of what will happen to children if computers are banned."	3	4		7

981	1	Dear newspapper I don't think that computers benefit our society. I don’t believe that computers can be dangerous they make people lazy and you can be easily scammed on the computer. One reason why I don’t think that computers benefit society is because it is very dangerous. Computers are dangerous because people can get kidnapped or herrassed. The town of @LOCATION1 police @CAPS1 says that over @PERCENT1 of kidnappings are from people that were met on social networks such as myspace and facebook. The police cheif also says that their are many cusses about people being herrassed by stalkers or people trying to harm them. Another reason why I dont think computers benifit us is because you can be scammed very easily on the computer. @PERCENT2 of people say that they have lost large ammounts of money due to credit card scam's on the computer. On computers their are sites that will act as if they are selling you something and take your credit card number and all of the other information that you give them and they will take your card and buy thing with it and you will have to pay for it credit card companies say that most credit card scams and frauds happen over the computer. The final reason why I don't believe that computers benifit us is because they make people lazy. Computers make people lazy because they are packed with a bunch of fun things like video games and you can watch videos and you could shop and you could see just about anything on a computer. I did some research and found that @PERCENT3 of people that are over weight have account's on multiple sites on computers. These are the reasons why I dont think computers benifit us. I hope you too heed to my advice.	4	4		8

Many people want computer because they do have enough money to @CAPS2 one. Some computers cost a lot @MONEY1 money like, @MONEY3, or @MONEY2 and even more than @MONEY3, or @MONEY2 it depend witch one they get. Around the world many people sell their computers to get money to @CAPS2 different stuff like, shoes, clothes or games. They always sell stuff on ebay to get less or more money, instead they can't take the computer back to get your money or to get a new computer. People want the classic computers, but now they come out with new ones like, touch screen ones. Many people been buying them at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or @ORGANIZATION1.

1001	1	"Dear Newspaper, I think people should use computers for spicific reasons. One reason is that many people lose family or to be more spicific lose contact with people. Then when you have a computer for someone else has one then you would be able to see them. For other purposes like wanting to play online with fellow student or friends then you have to use computers. Plus your fingers get a exercise when your typing. Many of us young kids say that myspace and facebook is a bad place. Actually its not because most of your family is on it. Doctors use computers all the time to notife other doctors that something wrong with a patient or give a visual of the bereathing. Workers even use it to see whats going on with the jobs if theres any jobs open so they can take it. Students use it to show what work they have to do when the teachers not there. If i was a capenter of a real estate agent I would have a computer with me. The reason why is that my group would know what houses are avalable to use or thats sold. Or I would give them different house to choose from and give them a good deal on it. I would also bring a computer with me for gps so i can know where I am. Many people use computers for different reason. Such as pog, cheatcodes, @CAPS1 cards and other thing. My reason for using this is because my work is important to me. I would do it on the computers if I miss it. That is why you should have computers all the time. You newer know what would happen. In conclusion, This is why computers are very important to have. The reasons are for if somthing happens. To you and you don't have a phone use a computer. Also its beneficial that everyone has thing to do but computers are the best thing to do."	4	4		8

Those people are very wrong! Computers are amazing! They allow easier research, I can learn about other countries, and can talk to people online. I do all of this stuff alsmost every day! We're just finishing up a pretty big research assignment for english and social studies. It involved taking a note cards from different sources. Luckily, I was able to go on the card catalog on the computer and find many books on my topic, just by typing the keyword! We can narrow down our options so easily because you can search for something so specific. After you find your topic, you can check and see if there's reliable information by reading a summary. All of this can be done in about @NUM1 minutes or less.This would be nearly imposible without a computer. I have a few relative in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. A while back my family and I were trying to plan a trip to @LOCATION2 to visit. We were able to go on a search engine and find directions to their house from the airport. it gave us the directions and the estimated amount of time it would take to get there. i've also been able to do plenty of research on other foreign countries at the push of a button. it's so simple and convenient, too! My two uncles live in @LOCATION1. On thanksgiving my mother was upset because she missed them I was then able to set them up in a video chatroom so my mom could talk to them. this is great, its so convenient to be to go an instant message. i can talk to people all over the world and it doesn't even any money! In conclusion, computers are very helpul because you can learn about foreign countries, have easy access to research, and can talk online. there's a long list of other things that make computers great, but it would take too long to write. Thank you again for listening."	5	5		10																					
1021	1	"I think that it is fine that people spend a lot of time on the computer instead of having time to exercise, enjoy nature and interact with family and friends because it is the persons choice to either stay on the computer all day or go outside. Computers affect peoples lives in good ways and bad ways. People stay inside all day and do nothing besides sit there and just click buttons. Good ways is that it educates you in many ways because @CAPS1 your on the computer watching or reading interesting things you could end up learning something before you learn it in school. Its good to go on the computer for a little a bit but @CAPS1 your on it all day then you could have no exercise and become lazy and fat. But @CAPS1 you go outside sometimes you wont have to worry because you are getting exercise that helps out your body. I think computers are a great way to have fun. You can chat with your friends, @CAPS1 you have a webcam you can video chat with friends. A cmputer is a great way for communication. Millions of people use a computer for working at their @CAPS2. Without computers life would be ten times harder for people in this world. People like accountants use computer for there job. They store data into the computer to remember things @CAPS1 you couldn't write it down on a piece of paper, People also make websites on the internet to help educate, like @CAPS1 you type in a word it could give you a definition, People also make @CAPS4 engines, @CAPS4 engines are some engine on a website that searches for things you type in. @CAPS1 you type in something you will get what you were looking for. My whole point of explaining this is that its the peoples choice @CAPS1 they would like to be on all the time. Because computers and internet connections arn't free. It doesn't even do anything bad to your brain. It mostly educates it. People even go to school online they learn and study on things that are on the internet. Plus you could get @CAPS2 at places for working with computers, You could make programs, and anything you would want. So my statement here is that its okay to spend alot of time on your computer instead of exercizing going to see friends and family and enjoy nature.

1025	1	"Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. It teaches hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Computers are one of the best technology invention yet to come that benefits society. First off, computers teach hand-eye coordination. For instance if you're in a rush to type an amazing long essay you won't have the time to keep looking back at your paper, the keyboard and the screen. So you would need to know where these handy-dandy keys are. However, if would be a lot more trouble if you didn't have any knowledge about computers are where the helpful keys are. Secondly, people would be able to learn about faraway places. If somebody wanted to take a nice, relaxing vacation/honeymoon with their beautiful wife they would need to know the weather forecast so they would know what clothes to bring, and how much money they need to bring to visit all the luscious, freshest restaurants, hottest stores in this enormous populated city. Without a doubt, I would love to take a vacation, but if it's going to cost a fortune I might have to re-consider this amazing trip. Lastly, you can talk online with other people. On blistering cold days and you can't go outside, or call them because you don't have phone you can myspace or facebook them as long as you want as long as you have a @NUM1 and only email address that nobody else has. Now it's time to decide! Do computers have a positive or negative effect on people. In my opinion computers are great for society and we should keep having them around because they teach hand-eye coordination, and give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Best of all, you will be able to talk to your friend and family online. This is certainly a great form of technology people should have."	4	4		8

No matter if you're just typing in a short password or a @NUM1 page essay, you'll alway have to type, and when you do @CAPS4 allows better movement at your hands.

Furthermore, computers continue to help instead with store say keep friends I can talk with friends or family far away. @CAPS4 keeps us together and gets I'm not saying that @CAPS4's always a good thing, because we all need face to face interaction. Although when you arent able to get that, its a good way to talk. To conclude, computers positivly effect our lives. We're able to get hand-eye coordination, and stay organized when @CAPS4 can be a trouble to do @CAPS4 can bring people together when they aren't in person. You can learn about new things like people and places far away. though people @MONTH1 think opposite of me, i know that computers benifit society."	5	4		9																					
1045	1	"What do you think about computers? I think computers have a very positive effect on people. All kids should have @NUM1. Please heed the following advice. Computers are a very good thing for kids to have. I teaches them life skills such as hand-eye coordination, a lot about technology. Expert @PERSON1 states ""@PERCENT1 of success full jobs involve some kind of inter-ation with computers, & if they learn those skills at an early age they can soon become experts."" Technology is a @CAPS1 part of life today, & will continue increasing with the years. It's a grevious idea to want to separate our kids from technology. As a child, my sister grew up with computers, she knew how to fully use it by age @NUM2, she went to collage with amazing computer skills. Today she works in a law ferm as presidental secretary. She gets paid loads of money. Today she trys to get me to learn about all tech stuff. If you have kids you know you only want the best in their present & future. People say kids are the future, not if theyre not succesfull. Computers are a great way for kids of all ages to learn & communicate with @NUM1 another & others. We all want our kids to be happy. @NUM4 out @NUM5 kids use the internet to research things for @CAPS2 & projects. Kid therapist @PERSON2 says ""kid who chat, with other kids though internet like facebook, @CAPS3, & myspace are normaly more socialy interactive with other kids. I know you thinking there a lot of ""@CAPS4"" thing on the internet dont want my kids to see, conversly you can set limits & child block. & you also dont want you kids at risk of obesity because of lack of excercise. So give them time limits. My cousins each go on the computer @NUM6 hours a day. They do @CAPS2 & whatever time they have left they chat with friends. Its not all @CAPS4. As you can see computers can be seen in a very possotive manner. Heed my advice & allow your kids the freedom of internet. They will be happier, trust me."	5	4		9																					
1057	1	"Dear local newspaper, @DATE1 I am going to write to you about if I think computers are a good idea or not. Yes, I do think computers are @CAPS12 awesome idea. I think this because @CAPS1 @CAPS2, you use computers for school projects. Next @CAPS2, it is @CAPS12 easy way to make friends from other towns. Last @CAPS2, you @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13. Yes, the electric bill could be higher, but for a good cause. You @CAPS10't just assume computers are bad for us, you might be surprised. @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am going to explain to you why we need computers to do projects. Well, I @CAPS5 from personal experience, my social studies teacher always likes you to type your final draft. Also, using a computer makes your projects easier because @CAPS3 @CAPS4 fixes your mistakes, and @ORGANIZATION1 finds everything you need. I find it much more easy to use a computer for projects and I @CAPS5 all of my friends think it is also. If you aren't persuaded yet, keep reading because I @CAPS5 you will be eventually! Next @CAPS2, I am going to talk to you about making friends just with a computer. I @CAPS5 that parents these days are really happy when you have come home and made new friends. Just by using a computer you could easily go online, search friends you want to @CAPS11 to @CAPS5 better, and chat with them. (to make sure they are who you think!) The other day my friend @PERSON1 came up to me and said meet my friend @CAPS6 I met online! I was really happy for her and realized computers are helpful. Everybody needs friends that are there for them, and computers are the perfect conclusion for that! Last @CAPS2, I am going to talk to you more about why and how you could @CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13. Do you @CAPS5 what @ORGANIZATION1 is? You @CAPS10 search @CAPS7 on @ORGANIZATION1! If you really wanted to @CAPS5 something and you were really curios you could search on @ORGANIZATION1! This is a great way to @CAPS11 educated. Also, computers help you with @CAPS12 @CAPS13 because everytime you are on @CAPS3 @CAPS4 typing a random story it will fix your mistakes, and you will learn off of these mistakes. So, to sum up this paragraph, a computer is @CAPS12 easy way to @CAPS11 @CAPS12 easy @CAPS13, and YOU need to keep computers to see for yourself. In conclusion, I was asked to write a paper to you seeing if I would like to keep computers or not. By now you @CAPS5 that I would like to. In case you are iffy about my reasons, I will simply restate them. @CAPS1, you need a computer for projects. Second, you @CAPS10 make friends. Last, you @CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13. All of these things are a huge benefit in laer life. Don't forget YOU @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13! That is whta everybody would like! I @CAPS5 you will come through to yourself and agree. Thank you for listening to me."	5	5		10																					
1058	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positieve effect on people. They do because you can talk to others online, it allows you to get research done faster and they are much more efficent and easy to use i will further explain my reasons. First of all, computers allow you to talk to others online. Talking to others online can give you good communication skills and you can get to know different people. I always talk to my friends online. We talk to each other using webcams, instany messaging, or talking on a social site like facebook. Computers and webcams can allow you to talk to friends who have moved away or for relatives. Next, computers allow you to get research done quicker. Studies shown that @PERCENT1 of people prefer using a computer to find information for any type of paper than an enclyepdia or other book. Computers are much more efficent and easier to use than books. It can agree that computers are much more efficent and that i like to use them. If you use a computer to get research done than you can be done sooner than you know it. Finally, computers are more efficent and easy to use. If you give a person to coose from a computer or a set of encyelpedias, most people would choose the computer. Computers are so much easier to use than books. On the comuter you just type in what you are looking for in search bar a boom within a tenth of a second your results are there. Now, if you use a book or enclyelpedia it could take several minutes to find what you are looking for, and then they only give very little information, unlike a computer that can give you millions of results for one topic. This proves that computer are more efficent than books. In conclusion, i believe that computer have a posieve effect on people. I do because you can talk to people online, it allows you to get research done quicker, and computers are more efficent and easy to use. I hope you will agree with me and my thoughts about computers."	4	4		8																					
1065	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 my name is @CAPS3 and I do not no where to start this letter. Im writing you this letter to let you know that I think that not everyone should use a computer. My first reason not everyone should use a computer is because they get so distracted in the computer they forget about school. My second reason not everyone should use a computer is because they @CAPS4 dont spent time with there parent. My third reason they shouldn't have people use the computer often is because they would get sick. My firs reason computer shouldnt be used often is because they forget about school. They forget about it in the way that there so distracted writing or chating or playing @CAPS4 that they forget about school. @CAPS5 reason is because their grades get low. They dont do homework either. My second reason is because they dont parents. Are more could be there so the computer they dont. My third reason is because their get computer there get @CAPS4 they dont and not @CAPS5 could that they dont get no education for being in the computer. That is why is bad to use a computer a lot I hope u understand."	3	4		7																					
1066	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 there is alot of talking and arguing about computers. Some say they are helpful to society and others say not. As for myself I am one of those on the side of which is for computers. I think the do alot less harm than good. First of all the hand-eye cordination of the user is mostly improved over a period of time, which helps withe learning musical instruments. Also it gives a great learning ability to people, particularly student. If there were computers, for a student to do a report he/she would have to read through an encyclopedia, which takes a great amount more time than plainly looking it up on the internet. Finaly computers are great for communicating with far-away friends or family. The first subject on my agenda is the hand-eye cordination skills. These skills are the ability to work with your hand and eyes simultaniously. There is a number of impacts these skills can make. The most apparent is musical instruments. If you are trying to learn a new song to be played on guitar you must move your fingers to the notes coresponding with the screen. Another place where hand-eye cordination comes in handy is sports. One sport where hand eye cordination makes a huge impact is in football. If the ball is thrown then the wide recever must watch the ball with his eyes and make sure he puts his hands in the best position to catch the ball. I am also going to argue the vost world of learning that is provided by computers. Lets just say someone asks you who was the @NUM1 president of the @ORGANIZATION2 where would you go to find that answer? I don't know about you but I am definatley going to look it up on google (internet search engine). Also schools @CAPS1 can ask alot more of their students because they have all this information at there desposal. Lastly I would like to cover the communications abilitys that the computer puts out there. First of all let say you have a very close friend move "out-of-state" how are you going to keep in touch. You could try using phones but yet the long-distance fees have sky-rocketed over the past @NUM2 years. Did you know that if you talk long distance for @NUM3 mins a day that would be over @NUM4 a month. in todays ecconmy you need to save money not talk it all away. The internet charges no additional fees for chatting no matter how far away you are from each-other. So hopefully my letter will be able to surposs "@CAPS2'bama's failed health care bill" to at least make it somewhere in the paper. People need to know the facts about computers before they try to argue about them."	5	4		9																					
1067	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people have computers, and @CAPS2 people use them. It's been brought to my attension that the government is worried about people using them to much. Well I think you can't use a computer too much. They offer so @CAPS2 things such as information, communication, and life skills. That doesn't too bad. Informaiton is something we as humans live for. Also in @CAPS2 schools and jobs you need to know a variaty of unusual facts. Where can you learn these? Computers of course! When @PERSON1 (my teacher) gives us a research paper on walt disney, we use computers to find our information. With out the computer, I wouldn't know walt disney died before disney world opened. That clearly shows one of the @CAPS2 things we need computers for. Communication is another aspect of our lives. With a computer you can have @MONEY1 ways to comunicate. Yes some of these way can be dangerous but, @CAPS2 are safe. When I was in @NUM1 grade my teacher ms.casserelle set up a classwide email for us. This allowed us to email another school. This farm of online communication was perfectly safe. As long as the person using these forms of communication is sem-responsible nothing can go wrong. Where can you go wrong with that? Did you know that @PERCENT1 of your life skills can and are learned on computers? As a matter-a-fact your job involves a computer! One life skill you can learn is how to type. As I stated earlier research papers need computers, well it's not just for the information. You have to type them too. Most jobs in our world need the computer for something or other. Can you think of a job that doesn't require one at all? Ididnt think so. Information, communication, and life skills are all important to our human nature. Ithink computers are important to humans. Wether you admit it or not everything we do involves a computer to some degree. Can you spend @CAPS2 countless hours on a computer? Yes, but you need to. you need to."	5	4		9																					
1072	1	"Dear editor, @CAPS1 you think that people spending a lot of time on the computer is good, I don't. People should get more exercize. Also they don't get enough fresh air. Finnaly they don't spend enough time with family and friends. Now we have to determin weather people should spend a lot of time on the computers. Those people who spend alot of time on the computer could be going outside everyday to get exersize. Some parents got their kids hooked on playing on the computer all day instead of going out side to get exersize. They could ride bikes, scooters, play basket ball, wiffle ball. They can also go swimming play, sports, and go to a play ground. Finnally they could go for a long walk on the beach. People need to get fresh air instead of being on the computer all day. They can go sit on the beach for awile, go outside to watch their kids play or watch their games like baseball or basket ball, or they can go outside just to be outsides. They can go sit on their porch to wait for their kids to get off the bus from school. Those people who love to play on the computor don't spend enough time with their family or friends. They could go visit their family more often, go out for lunch with their frinds. Also they can spend more time doing things with their kids. Even though there is a chat on the computer it is nice to talk to your friends in person. The time has come to decide weather people spending a lot of time on the computer is a bad thing or not. They don't ge enough exersize every day. They also don't get enough freshair. Finally they spend time with their friends and family. So now you need to write a letter to your local newspaper telling them which you are choosing."	4	4		8																					
1079	1	"Dear newspapers, I think that computers have a possitive effect on people because you could chat online. There are electronics out for children that they can plug up to there computer and learn different stuff. And you can pay your bills on the computer. People that have no phone od don't want to leave the house at that moment and have a computer can go on chat rooms or a local website can chat to friends and family. Also many people that have websites like facebook, myspace etc... can find new people and have so many things in common. And some people do find that @CAPS1 person that they been looking for. I think that they jusy come out with a new electronic for little kids like leaf frog that they can plug up to a computer/laptop and they can learn there alaphabet, counting numbers, and even spelling, This is a good product for little kids so they cam use the extra work over, the @DATE1 or after school so they can stay smart and learn in school and out of school. One day I had my mother what she was doing and the light bill so i was like how can you and she said and a website bt I forgot what's it called and you could pay your bills right there. So instead of up going in your are go to a local show when thay pay bills and can like or if you get a computer you can do that in you home with no . So people who publish the newspaper I think and I hope you think to this is a good response that tells you good things about a computer. And I hope it sticks around for a long time."	4	4		8																					
1094	1	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know, the majority of people now posses computers. Computers have greatly advanced society and technology. Some people say that computers have negative effects, but that is not true. Computers have influenced people in many benificial ways. Although some experts want people to use computers less, that technology is required in schools. Kids are fold to type their papers, which lets them finish faster. This faster finish can lead to kids not staying up too late. Then doing homework. That is better for their health. Computers also develop hand-eye coordination which is an essential skill for later in life. In my opinion computers have greatly contributed to technology. They are letting explore place human has ever/could ever go. We can make and distribute item much faster. In addition, computers also let people learn about faraway places about different cultures and different people. Computers can expand everyone's horizons and let them know about places and things that they never knew existed. With are of the largest number of members. Facebook is a website that people use to communicate. More than @PERCENT1 of most students in an average school have one. They communicate there more than they could without computers. Computers aren't making people ""anti social"" or making them interact with friends less, they're actually talking more. Computers are letting people communicate daily with people from all around, without having to wory about running out of cellphone minutes. Overall, computers are letting people broaden their horizons are lock of new things. They are more of a benefit than a burden. Computers are the next best thing since sliced bread."	4	4		8																					
1104	1	"Dear Readers, @CAPS1 of the most important inventions of the past decades is the computer, and it has its pros and cons. I think people spend to much time on computers, especially teenagers. They spend to much time on @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, and not enough time outside enjoying nature and playing sports or exercising. While they @MONTH1 talk with friends with @CAPS4, it is not the same as going to the park with friends and playing a game of baseball. Families also are distant form each other when they sit around on @CAPS5. Teenagers spend too much time on the @CAPS6 going where they should instead of doing more benefitul activities like reading. I sure we all know at least @CAPS1 obese person or teenager. My neighbor is the size of a killer whale and eats just about as much as @CAPS1. He will sit on the computer chair and stare with his eyes glazed at the computer chair and stare with his eyes glazed at the computer screen for hours on end. Sometimes I wonder how many brain cells he wastes per second. I will bet that everyone who reads this knows someone like my neighbor. The statistic @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2 is obese is not exagrated at all. In my opinion, it is the fault of the @CAPS6 and computers. Instead of going to the gym or the soccer field with friends, they got to the computer and talk and eat junk food. They spend their time watching pointless @CAPS5 videos, while they should be playing baseball or football. Doubters say you learn hand-eye cordination with computers, but you can learn better with sports. Computers are a large factor in obesity because they encourage @CAPS1 to sit around instead of doing standard @NUM1 minutes a day of exercise. The next pressing issue is the amount of reading the average teenager and @CAPS9 does. I would say that the average gets about @NUM2 minutes of reading a day because they are to busy chating with friends on the @CAPS6. I have a cousin who reads about a book every @NUM3 years and fail every test he gets and has stayed back @NUM4 times, but instead of reading and learning, he is chating and texting. He wastes these excellent educational opportunitys while their are people in underdevolped countries like @LOCATION3 who are lucky to own a book. I know more than @PERCENT2 of the kids in my class do not read anything execpt the required reading and that is because they sit around on the computers wasting @CAPS10 is about @NUM5 and that number is decreasing because of the lack of reading done and the time on computers spent. I have seen survey that say @NUM6 out of @NUM7 spend more than @NUM6 hours a day on computers. These statistics and quotes have left me thinking, how much time do we really need to spend on computers instead of reading or else we will turn into oversized monkey who can't even rad. The computers and @CAPS6 are doing more than just erasing brain cell and are health, they are taking away the expriences that we could have outside in nature. Nature holds natural wonders like the @ORGANIZATION1, the @CAPS11 @CAPS12 and the @CAPS13 @CAPS14. What beats sking down a large slope, or climbing the @LOCATION1, certainly not computers. Unfortunatly, that what most @CAPS15 choose to do. They sit and tap on the keyboard instead of walking nature trails and walking on the beaches. They sit on old moldy chairs and stare at computer screens, unlike the people enjoying the butterfly gardens and wildlife preserves. Instead of taking steps to help the enviorment we are siting on the computers sleeping and being mesmerized by the light of the screen. We should be preserving and learning abouy what is left on the planet, but we are not because of these computes and the @CAPS6. I have present a strong arguement against computers that you @MONTH1 listen to or not. I strongly urge you to take action to start reduce time on computers spent. Set up programs at your house or town for turning off the computers. We need to do something now!"	5	5		10																					
1109	1	"Dear Newspaper, Computers benefit society because they teach people. They are also helpful because they solve problem that humans might have trouble with. They can also entertain us when we have nothing to do. They can teach people many things. They can help tourist learn about a location they wish to travel to. Actually @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 tourist research the area there going to on a computer. They help students catch up or fully understand something. One time I was having trouble with fraction, in math. So I decided to look up the way to find the answer and it caught me up with the class again. The computer can explain cultures from any where in the world. According to culture digest.com @PERCENT1 of people visiting a new country. Find out about the culture first. Computers solve problems that some people might not now about. It can solve a math problems easily with a built in calculator. @NUM3 out @NUM4 computer users have used calculator to help them solve a problem. They also solve geographic problems. There @MONTH1 be an about of date map but this is easily solved with live satelite maps. Map tools says there has never been a flaw in their system. Computers have a wide viarety of entertainment. They can play music. @PERCENT2 of teens get there music from the computer over a cd. Computers can entertain you with games. One day it was raining hard and I had nothing to do so I went on my computer and played minesweeper. This kept me very entertained. Please take this letter into consideration. Thank you for time."	4	4		8																					
1110	1	"More and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Well, to me it does benefit society in many ways like, learning online. You can learn many things online, you can practice math, reading, and even writing. You can also have fun online if your bored at home and have nothing to do. Also, you can interact with friends and family members, by email etc. When your online you can learn alot of things. If your at home, and you need to study for a test, you can go online and study. You can also learn more, because you can learn how to do a math problem if you don't know it, or just catch up on reading. People sometimes need a computer because they might be bored, so they can go online and play games and have fun. People, especially kids get bored at times, so they can just go on the computer and play games and trivias so they can still learn. Computers can let you interact with your family and f riends. You can e-mail or webcam. if yopu haven't talk to someone a long period of time you can just go to the computer and talk to them. If you want to find a @CAPS1 school classmate that you haven't talked to in years, you can now. Computers do benefit the society, In my own opinion we do need computers. If parents do not want their child on websites they don't approve of, the parents can always block those websites. Computer are really nessacary they can help in a huge way."	4	4		8																					
1116	1	"Dear local newspaper, I am here today to state my reason why I am against usage of computers. My @NUM1 reason why I am against usage of computers is, the negativity, like for example too many pop ups come on the website your own and then they mini little advertisments like ""@CAPS1 on me"" ""free trial"". And thats not good for children to see when they are using the computer. My seocnd reason why I am against using computers is who's online when your up there. @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people use the computer every single day and @NUM3 out of @NUM5 people be up there chatting with young little girls and boys. And they older what then what they say. What I'm trying say is these people are called ""@CAPS2"". These people roam through the internet day and night trying to find little boys and girls. Just like I say earlier thats not good computer usage. The purpose of getting on the computer is look for information or play games no that other stuff. My final reason of being against computer is montoring, alot of parents dont watch their kids when they are on the computer, so most of the kids look at a lot of inapproiate sites or things that they shouldn't look at. And that be their fought beacuse they should have parental lock up there. In conclusion, basically what I am trying to say is computers can be dangerous sometime because you dont always know what your clicking on and you can @CAPS1 on the wrong thing and end up on a site that you don't want to be on. So just have my opinions and maybe you can understand what I'm trying to say. Thanks."	4	4		8																					
1124	1	"Dear @PERSON2 - @CAPS1, I strongly suggest that people do not spend as much time on computers as they do comently. People will be doing much better things, such as exercising or spending more time with family and friends. Both these things are better for people's body and mind, and one more useful later in life. Please consider the following about why it will be more beneficial @CAPS2 people do not spend as much time on computers. First, exercising is an exellent alternative to sitting at a computer screen. A recent study by @ORGANIZATION3 and the @ORGANIZATION1 studies found that an average person spent five hours per day on the computer. By cutting out at least some @ORGANIZATION1 these hours, people will be able to make time for more exercise in their daily routine. Also, @PERSON3 at @ORGANIZATION4 says that ""@PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people do not exercise enough in the @LOCATION1 alone."" @CAPS2 some free time being on the computer is taken away, people will reward themself by taking care @ORGANIZATION1 their bodies. Moreover, I tried not using my computer for a week, and it was a great experience because in that free time I learned how to do a back flip in gymnastics. There are so many possibilities in exercising @CAPS2 people do not use their computer as much. Second, @CAPS2 people do not spend as much time on the computer, they get more experience with social skills. For example, @PERSON1 at @ORGANIZATION5 says ""@CAPS2 people spend time with family and friends, they gain necessary social skills for later in life."" A study at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that people who spend three hours or less on their computers have up to @PERCENT2 better social, verbal, and quick-thinking skills. Spending time with people's family and friends in stead @ORGANIZATION1 on the computer is exremely beneficial. I try to spend at least three hours a day spending time with family and friends and I have good relationships with them. Clearly, it is better to spend less time on the computer, and more time exercising or spending time with family and friends. Some people @MONTH1 say people can talk to people online so this is social skills, but in fact people gain better social skills from person-to-person interactions because they must use quick thinking and their emotions too. Altogether, I strongly believe spending less time on the computer is the best way to stay heathy mentally and physically. Thank you for considering my opinion."	5	4		9																					
1125	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 recently has been brought to my attention that computers have been affecting peoples daily lives. i do agree with this because with our countries of obesity. More people need to exercise more, interact with freinds, and to just enjoy things that don't involve technology. Some people are just super glue to computers, but let's see if @CAPS3 doesn't start wearing down after this paper. Many individuals are spending too much on their computer and less time working out or exercising. People need to start spending more time on exercising and less time on their computer due to the facts that more and more states obese percents just keep rising. Yes, you @MONTH1 say I will just go on a diet ino! Diets don't always work and many people have tned them. Even a simple one hour walk with your dog is better than lazily browsing the web. And if you wanted, you could even join the local gym for @MONEY1 a month. Buttle only way this is going to happen is by you wanting to do so. Now you know how to fix your problem, get going! More people need to interact with friends instead of going on their computer. Interacting with friends or family will help themm be better with their social hucs in all. Yes, maybe your friends and family out and hungry with your friends most likely you will have more fun exercising then you have on the computers. By interacting with friends and family will help youn later in life by being more social and ready any job interview to meet you less nervous. F inally, enjoying things that don't involve technology is good to know because many people don't have as much fun out in the real world. You have to mete @CAPS3 fun. This can be schevered by asting a frend to go on a compy trip with ypu or spending a little diugh to enjoy yourself. The ourdoors and nature consists of many beautiful and awesome things; but the only way to realize this id to have fun outside or explore whats the great tourst. In conclusion, many people's lives are being manipulated by computers and destroying their daily live. but maybe due to these essy tips; excrsing more, by soul."	4	4		8

Studys have shown that @NUM1 out of the @NUM2 have improved hand-eye coordination. Also it help kids @CAPS1 that it stimulates the nerves in the hands and brain for kids that have had sergery on there hands. Last years study has shown that @PERCENT1 of kids have improved hand movement faster than regular therpy. Secondly. The importance of computers have been commucation like email or aim. This @CAPS1 great for penpals because it saves time for responses from mail and money because there @CAPS1 no mailing to places and when you email them there will be a fast responce. Also this will help people that are shy around people. A study has shown that @PERCENT2 of shy kids have increased the talkative skills in school. Also most talkative skills will help kids today with there confidence. Finaly, the computer @CAPS1 a helpful knolage tool to use.

It helps education because @CAPS5 always use computers to help kids learn important information. for example if we have to study for something there are websites specialy made for studing.

For example instead of writing an essay for school and having it take hours than your hand is and to findout its filled with miss-spelled words. Instead you can type it quick and use spell check. I have never heard one person say that the computer hasn't make life @CAPS4. Another example is if you had to find some information on you new dog. Instead of goind to your library spending minutes.You can simply open up you internet and then search it and find the info you need in seconds. That's why the computer make every thing @CAPS4. The last reason is that one. Traveling is such a without a computer With out it you have to go to to buy tickets. In fact I don't even remember what it was like to not @CAPS9 online with a computer all you have to do is go to the parts websites and then but it from there its so easy areselfs to places but traveling mail to each other also. I haven't sent a @CAPS8 card in years. Instead I @CAPS9 email. It quicker, @CAPS4 and more reliable. That is why traviling people and mail is @CAPS4. Over all the computer is one of the most helpful things ever and with technology upgraing daily soon it will be even @CAPS4 to do things. While too much computer is bad and people souldn't @CAPS9 interact with internet. The computer games in handy almost all the time. That is why i think the computer is @CAPS3."	4	4		8																					
1140	1	"Computers are the future. Computers are the best technology we've created. They allow us to improve our hand-eye coordination, learn about faraway people and places and what with our friends. Computers improve our hand-eye coordinations typing is a good way to improve this vital skill by not looking and knowing which buttons are where. Using a mouse is also a good to improve by moving the digital mouse with the one in your hand. This can improve foster writing, because you are moving the friend in your hand the same way you would move a mouse or type. This can also help driving, because you can't look at the wheel, you have to keep your eyes on the word, and in order to do that you most know how you're moving the wheel. Computers can help hand-eye coordination which can help with writing and driving, with typing and and moving a mouse. Computers can increase our knowledge about faraway places, and people. Cultures come in a variety we can learn about all of them from the comfort of our own home. We can also learn about nature from our home. Learning about different cultures can teach us many things. Like what kind of clothes they wore, food they ate, place the, lived in. This allows us to change our own culture by getting inspired from others. Learning about new places can help broaden the mind about other spots in the world that can lead to a vacation. Lastly, computers allow us to internet with friends from our chairs. Chatting, and e-mailing and video chatting are all great ways to interact. With a webcam you can even see the other person as if you here face-to-face with them. You can also e-mail important files, such as pictures, docucuments, and even videos. This can help with someone's job. In conclusion, computers can teach us hand-eye coordination, can teach us about faraway places and people, and lets us interact and share with friends. Computers are a very important part of my life."	4	5		9																					
1143	1	"To the @CAPS1, I have recently heard that some people think that computers don't benefit society. However, I disagree with that. First, it allows children and adults to learn about distant places and other things. Also, it allows family and friends to connect with other family and friends. And lastly, it is a form of entertainment on a day that you can't go outside. Some people might not agree with me. However, I believe the computer wasn't a waste of thought. I think the computer is a benefits to society and the whole world. First, the computer allows children and adults to learn about distant places and, other things. People, professors, historians, and either highly educated people past discoveries and information about things everyday. That means everyday someone can learn something everyday of their life. When I do research on a important person in history, I learned things I never learned in school. The computer is the best way to allow people to put info they've learned for other people to see and gain knowledge of each other these are endless possibilities for everyone who owns a computer to learn. You wouldn't believe the things you can learn on a computer. Also, the computer allows family and friends stay in touch with other family and friends in far away places. If there was computers and someof your family moved to a diffrent. There wouldn't be an efficient way to stay in touch with them. The computer allows you to send e-mail to a families computer or celluar phones. The computer is the best way to stay close to your family even though they are far away. My brother is in @LOCATION1 and every day I get on the computer when I get home and video chat with him. If there was no computer, I wouldn't be able to chat with my brother. Lastly, the computer allows a form of entertainment on a rainy day. Certain software gives people the chance to create games and post online to the public. When I can't go outside because of the weather I get on my computer and play video games. The games keep me company. I can never play with other people with online multiplayer. Some of the games are educational also. The games teach you different things about history. "	4	4		8																					
1144	1	"Dear @LOCATION4 @ORGANIZATION2, Computers are a great invention but people are starting to dislike it. On the hand, I believe the computers put positive effects on people. First of all, they are a great way for kids to have fun: @CAPS1, people can learn very interesting facts. Lastly, it is a great way to communicate with friends and family. These are a few reasons I think computers put a positive effect on people. To begin with on a computer you can have a lot of fun by playing games. The computer saves money for a lot of us. For example, if you bought a game system it would cost well over @MONEY1 but on a computor you can find and play games for free. Not all games have to be like ""@CAPS2 of @CAPS3"" or ""@CAPS2 of @CAPS5"" they can be games about sports. Supose one student broke his leg and he love playing soccer. He could just on the computer and play a game of soccer even though he has a broken leg. People can @CAPS1 learn various facts right from their computers. The most important thing that computors are made for is to learn new things. No one in the @CAPS2 knows everything, but if every one put what they know into the computer than people can get learne any thing from them, I remember @CAPS6 my friend once told me about some guy named @PERSON2. I had no idea who he was so my friend started laughing at me, @CAPS6 I got home I searched him up and by the time I was done reading about him I knew more than my friend about @PERSON2. If he ever have a question in class and our teacher can't answer it he/she always tells us to either ""@CAPS7"" it or ""@CAPS8"" it. They both are search engines. Not only can you learn a lot from computers you can @CAPS1 communicate with people from different countries. What if @PERSON1 did not invent the telephone? How different would our life be me right now? Anyway most people use the computer to communicate nowadays. Whether it @CAPS9 or @CAPS10, or whether its @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS11 all are a great way to communicate with people. With tele phones it costs money to talk with people in a different country, but with the roputer it is absolutely freen. You could be living in @LOCATION1 and chatting with someone in @LOCATION5. You could live in @LOCATION2 and email someone in @LOCATION3. Communication every where is fast and easy with the computer. My whole family lives in @LOCATION6 and it costs us twice as much to make a call there. @CAPS6 we use the computer it is even better because they can even see our fare throught the webcam. As you can see, computers are not negitive at all for all I know is that help people around the @CAPS2. They help kids have fun with the games we can play. @CAPS1, it teaches children and adults various now things. Lastly, it is a great communication strategy. I hope that you put those reasons in our local paper so every one can see how computers have a positive effect on people."	5	6		11																					
1146	1	"@ORGANIZATION1, In my point-of-view, I think that computers are positive and can give a lot of information to us humans. Even though some people say computers are sometimes used way too much, computers help the world get in touch with relatives and family from arand the world, job findings in different countries and states, and also learning about the whole world. I'm going to explain to you why I think computers are positive for humans. To start off, I would like to say that not everyones families & friends live close by to each other. They @MONTH1 live across the whole other side of the world. This is why we have webcams and chatting on computers. How could anyone expect us to see our family in friends if there is no webcam? Okay yeah we have cell phones but not everyone can afford them. People can go to their hearest library and use the computer there for free! The next reason why I say that computers are important is because when you get tired of fired from yar job, you can't just sit home and expect live in your house for free, you have @CAPS1 find another job. You can sign up for jobs right on your computer. How much easier could it get? Now you don't have to borrow your mom's car to go to the interview. Furthermore the last reason I would like to commit is that learning about the world is very important for the young and old. You don't think that every single teacher visited somewhere else and that's how they know about the world? No of course not! Teachers also use computers to look up information on a certain subject. For me I like to learn a bout crocodiles in @LOCATION1. I live in the @ORGANIZATION2. Do you really think I would go all the way of @LOCATION1 to learn about crocodiles when I can just turn the computer on and get-lost in the crocodile world? No of course not. It would be fun though to traver to @LOCATION1 to see that but I don't have that kind of money. To sum all this up, I think you can see my part of the argument. I really consider leaving computers to what they do best, helping humans. It's one of the best inventions ever made. Wouldn't you agree?"	4	4		8																					
1158	1	"Dear newspaper I think that there are many reason why computers are good for people. Compters are good for people because they help keep friends conected. Reason two is that they can be great knowledg   for people. @CAPS1 third reason that computers are good for people is that there are many programs that are team based and help people with teamworks and team building skills. Those are three of the many reasons why I think that computers are good for people and have had a positive effect. First of all, I think that computers are good for people because they help keep friends connected. If you move to another town, go to a colledge far away, or move because of a job you will most likely, if @CAPS5 is further away, loose connection with you friends. But, using a computer can solve that problem. In social networking sites like @CAPS3, twitter and myspace you can simpily look up your distant friends from  you previoulsy lived and have contact with them. Youi can catch up with each other, recall good times you've had, end maybe make plans to meet each other sometime. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have been reconnected using social networking site on a computer. Experts also say that @CAPS5 is important to stay connected with your past to sustain a well being and to be happier. I have had an experience when a scoial networking site has reconnected me with a @CAPS2. When i was younger I had a @CAPS2 whos grandmother lived  to @CAPS1 dad. After a little over a year of  him being good friends be moves to @LOCATION1, I thought I would never hear from him again. Later that year I also moved to a different town, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 searched me on @CAPS3 and we got connected again, I have found out he moved back to where I use to live. That is the first reason I think that computers are @CAPS4 good for people. The second reason, @CAPS5 is that computers can be great knowledge scources for people. If you ever need to set information   that not have to  through the  of book,then, a computer is the thing for you. As long as you than  to find an accurate and reliable scourse than a computer. Is an amazing tool. You can look up almost anything and you will be able to find locks of information on @CAPS5. Statistics show that you can find @PERCENT2 more information on a computer than a book. Experts have stated that soon books will be obsolite and computer will rain  as knowledge scources. That is the second reason why I think computers are good for people. Last of all, I think that computers are good for people because there are many programs that help with teamwork and team buildings skills. What I  by programs is yes of course videogames. Almost all of the computer games out have multiplayer features. Withins the multiplayer universe there are match types that involve a great amount of teamwork. In the age games you must communicate and talk to your team if you want to win. And that is the only way you will win is by using teamwork. That is @CAPS1 third reason why I think computers are good for people. In conclusion, I think that computers are good for people, they help to reconnect friends, , knowledge, and build teambuilding skills with programs that are out for @CAPS5."	4	5		9																					
1162	1	"Dear Local @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 I see why some people think that computers and technology are bad for society, I on the other hand strongly disagree with them. In my eyes technology, especially computers can bring people together and computers are very benificial to @CAPS5. Also computers can save you time and money now. First off computers can bring people together. I had one of my best friends move across the country, all the way to @LOCATION1! and I don't get to see her so I now video chat with her on my laptop. and if I didn't have that opportunity then we probably wouldn't have stayed in touch with each other. That experience was not only with a friend but it happened with a family member as well, my grandmother. Every year for passover the whole family comes to house to celebrate but because she is getting older we video chat so she can see the whole family together. It is wonderful experience. As I said before computers can be benifical to @CAPS5. You might be thinking ""@CAPS3 it can only understand that but I am a student at @ORGANIZATION1 and sometimes I forget to write an assignment down so I get my laptop and go to @ORGANIZATION1 notes. com, if that was have gotten a zero on the homework. See! Computers are very benifical! Have you ever been in a situation where you need something but you just don't have time? Well now many things can be ordered offline. You can get things from food to cloths and toys. Surveys have proven that over @PERCENT1 of average @CAPS4 order off of the computer and save money from gas because they don't have to drive. Overall, I think computers can be handy and helpful to all ages, @CAPS5 with homeworks, family and friends and adults who don't have a lot of time. And I think as years go by more and more people will start to realize that."	4	4		8																					
1167	1	"How do you think the world would be without computers? I think it would bring us back a couple of ages. We need computers for communication and to learn things that need to learn. Without computers our country would be nothing. People say you don't get enough exercise and don't enjoy nature enough. Well there are ways to do that too. Communication is one of the greatest things about computers. Teenagers love to @CAPS9 @CAPS10 eachother when there at home because its so fast its like really talkiing to them. @CAPS1-@CAPS2 is another thing people love to use. Bosses of companies use @CAPS1-@CAPS2 to send @CAPS10 to everyone so they're all on the same page. There is also a new video chat were you can talk face to face with someone and see them from the other side of the world if you wanted to. You can also learn all you need to know on computers. They have dictionary sites, history sites, encyclopedia sites, etc. You can find any certain time in history and have a whole site on it. Or a site called wikipedia you can look up a certain thing and get a whole web page dedicated to the info of that object or person. Schools also use sites to help students have their knowledge. They have math sites, english sites, @CAPS3 studies sites, and (a science teacher favorite) @CAPS4 @CAPS5 for everything you need to know about science. They also have lots of websites for help with a new language. There is a recent program out caled @CAPS6 @CAPS7 that is on the computer but teaches you any language as well as any human teacher. Some people still say its not enough. They say you still need exercise, nature, and time with your family. You can still do all that on computers. You can look up certain workouts that you might want to do. You can search good trails to hike on that are near where you live. They have websites (like @CAPS8) were you can @CAPS9 @CAPS10, @CAPS11 pictures, play games, and video chat with your family members who @MONTH1 be living across the world from you. But you canstill do it. Even though I explained a lot of reasons why computers are a great thing to have, there are still a ton more. The teach hand eye coordination and many other things too. You can check sports scores from the night before or check sports score from @NUM1 years ago. You can do all this on the computer and more. This is why computers have a positive effect on people and everyone should have a computer."	5	5		10																					
1172	1	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I feel that those people that think computers do not benefit society, are right. I feel this way because people need to start exercising it more, and interact with family and friends. Also, should enjoy life. Please read on to read in detail, as to why I feel this way. Firstly, those who are always on the computer need to exercise more, they need to exercise to stay healthy and strong. If they don't, they will most likely eat more and gain a lot of unwanted fat. Also, some of them don't even exercise at all. Secondly, they don't interact with their family and friends as much. Those people tend to probably argue with their family because they had to get off of computer. When you fight with people you want to gey away from it so you go back to the computer. It's not healthy to be on the computer for long periods at a time. Lastly, they should enjoy life. See the world through their own eyes. Party with friends and family. Go to college and do something with their lives. They need to enjoy things how they originally were without any computers, ipods, or even cellphones. In conclusion, the reasons I feel this why are because people need to exercise more, and interact with family and friends. Also, they need to enjoy life. I hope you understand as to why I feel this way."	3	4		7																					
1173	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are benefitual to society. This because computers do tasks such as helps research, communicating with others, and has fun games and websites. Computers are really great sources for whatever you trying to do. Honestly, a @CAPS2 without computers I wouldn't know what to do. Computers are like digital encyclopedias, which has just about all the information your looking for. Computers have databases or websites design to have with research just as the do. Say that you have a essay due tommorrow and you need quick and valid information you can simple go to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 which is a computer database. Your end up with saild facts to help with your final draft. So, you wouldn't have to go that far to research. Communicating is something else the computer helps with. For example email and @ORGANIZATION1 is a way to communicate. Email is where you can send a message and a wait a reply while on the other hand @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 is where you get @ORGANIZATION1 replys. The latest thing in the communicating @CAPS2 is video chating. This where the person your chatting with can hear and see exactly what your doing. This is useful for families who life a good distance from each other. Computers play many roles and being used for fun is one. the @CAPS5 has many fun gaming websites such as @CAPS6.com miniclips.com, and @LOCATION1. This websites help take your mind off a bad day. You can also buy computer games for your computer. A very popular game is The @CAPS7. This game is base around your charater and the life you chose for it to live this game can take you to mother place where all your stress just fade away. So, computers betters society in many different ways. A few include research, communication, and to have fun. The computer is a very enhanced tool to enrich ones life. Computers take on difficult tasks and usually succed. So, computers are truely one thing we need."	4	4		8																					
1174	1	"Dear Local @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you know long of time spent on technology could result in cancer? ever since they were invented, computers have been advanced more and more even years. People, especially children, forget the risks of physical health. Family and friends and even mental health. Obesity rate is over to @LOCATION1, the highest it has ever People wouldn't even know technology is to blame. @CAPS2 you know the average @CAPS3 teenager spends at least @NUM1 hours on the computers? Think off all the calories that build up without exercise. If people could limit their at risk for diabetes. Diabetis is one of the most common disease involved with technology besides obesity. @NUM2 @CAPS4 are diabetic which means we are not at a safe health rate. If you limit computer use to @NUM3 hour a day, and work out atleast @NUM4 minutes a day, think of how healthy you will be you will have more healthy you will be you will have more energy, and mental focus, sleep wont be an issue, and you will be more physically attractive. Computers also lead friendship torn apart. cyber bullying is also a problem. @NUM4 of students are cyber bullies. This means that friendship will wont see each other if they spend all day on the mental health when they turn on the computer. @CAPS2 you know some forms of cancer are caused by the radiation of technological devices? Radiation eats away the brain causing altsimers, and other mental disease that snew at old age. Young adults in school also got used to texting. @PERCENT1 of students text and @PERCENT2 get used to terrible spelling, thats @PERCENT3 who accidentally write ""thru, lazy, or even native @CAPS5 during school."" This is the mental if of technology taking over. So as you can tell computers affect health, socializing, and even mentality. So don't be part of the problem, please, stop overuse of technology."	5	5		10																					
1178	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a student I believe that computers have many bad effects on people. Most people think that computers are just new helpful technology, but there is more to it than just that. There are many things going on in the cyber world. Computers are quite helpful in school research, work and other important stuff, but there are many bad effects too. Kids these days are so attached to their computers almost all day after getting home from school which means that they barely do homework, projects, and important assignments from getting too distracted by the computer. There are some parents who get tricked by their kids that they are just doing homework, but reality is that kids these times are meeting tons of strangers through social networks such @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 @NUM1, @CAPS6 and other networks. Once that they decide to meet in person with these strangers many things go wrong because not everyone is @CAPS2 nice @CAPS2 they @MONTH1 seem through the internet. It shows how dangerous it can be for kids to be using the computers so much. people such @CAPS2 young children, pre teens and teenagers are able to view many harmful and inappropriate things anyone their ages shouldn't be viewing at all. Another concern is how people spend all day on their computers probably eating any type of junk food and then they don't exercise at all and they gain weight and not well fit physically which becomes a health issue for kids @CAPS2 age @NUM2 to much older people such @CAPS2 age @NUM3 and much older too which turns out to be a bad health life for people. From people spending nearly all day on the computer, they aren't able to go out and discover new things, exercise, hang out with friends or just have fun and spend time with their families. I also do strongly consider that the computers or laptops should not stay in a kids room because then they lock themselves in their room all day and they even stay up till really late even past midnight and then it becomes a real issue for kids or adults to get up early in the @TIME1 for school or work and are usually late. This pretty much shows how computers are not so great for people all the time. In order for people to be able to use their computers and have a life they can plan out a schedule of how long to use the computer and it might help them out a lot."	4	5		9																					
1184	1	"In todays day in age, computers are a key part to business, education, and recreation and they benefit our society. First of all, you can get a better education learning from them, also, it is a great way to communicate with people. Finally, it even teacher hand-eye coordination that you could use in your everyday life. My first point is that you can get a better education using them. For example, the textbooks that we use in social studies at our school still refers to @LOCATION3 as the @LOCATION1. Computers are a great way to get up-to-date information about the world. ""With our outdated textbooks in school, the @CAPS1 is our number one recourse to get information."" @CAPS2 @PERSON2 eighth grade teacher. With computers, you can learn about far away places without learing the comfort of your own home. In addition to getting a great education from them, computers are an eyelent form of communication. I remember when I was in @NUM1 grade and my father was across the world on a business trip. Our phones couldn't call long distance so we relied on computers to communicate with each other. This helped me get over my father's absence. When you use a computer to communicate you are also saving money."" You can save over @MONEY1 a year. When you use the @CAPS1 to communicate over a cell phone."" @CAPS2 @PERSON1, electronics expert. Finally, the use of a computer increas hand-eye coordination. With all the typing you do on a key board, your hand dexterity increases by the second. In fact, ""@PERCENT1 of computer users are more coordinated throught their day, opposed to people who don't own a computer."" @CAPS3 a recent pole in the @LOCATION2 times. And in this day in age hand-eye coordiantion is a neccesity. Besides wouldn't you like to have the ability to have your hands work without having to look at them? So as you can see, computers would benifit society and everyone who uses them. They are a great benifit that @CAPS4's need for their education and buisness. Thank you for listenging."	5	5		10																					
1186	1	"Dear @CAPS1: Some people believe computers benefit society. However, others feel they are too consuming. I for me I belive computers help society. Computers teach hand-eye cordination, give people, and even allows computer to chat online with other people. I'd bet your job requires you to use a computer, you probably even have a personal computer which you like to use to chat with friends. I do that all the time and I like it. Another thing I like are sports. One of my favorite sports is softball. In softball you need to have hand-eye cordination, this will help you swing at the ball more accuratly. When a pitcher throws the ball you have to had the bat at the right angle and watch the ball to know when to swing if kids used computers and become good at hand-eye cordination, then possibly more kids would join a local sports team, and possibly even join travel team. Do you like to travel? I do, and are why I learn about places before I go is by looking that particular place up on the internet. About three years ago I went on vacation to @LOCATION1. I wanted to know what it was like there because I had never gone before, so when I looked it up I found out that they had many torist attractions and ""packages"" that let you swim with dolphins, I was very excited to go and when I did, I had a biast, and to think if I didn't look it up I would not have known what kinds of fun things they had! No wonder so many people like computers! One of the biggest reasons why I like computers is because I can chat with my friends online one main attraction online is @CAPS2, everybody, primarily, has one. Some people have one because they like to look at pictures. I have one because I like to chat with my friends. One night I was chatting with a friend we were laughing having a great time, and then she reminded me that we had science homework due the very next day! I thanked her and then completed my work. You see if kids chat online their friends can remind them of important nescesitys such of homework. This could impove grades by @PERCENT1! So you now see why society needs computers and if you have forgotten let me remind you: computers teach you hand-eye cordiantion, let's you learn about faraway places and people, and now allows you to chat online. Just think what would society be like with no computers."	5	4		9																					
1190	1	"Dear local newspaper, Computers are a waste of time! People that say they are helpful are just using that as excuse. Some people say they are good for research and talking to people. Both of these things you can do without a computer. Computers are just a money wasting thing that get in your way of life. People spend hours on computers talking to people. You don't need to do that. You can use a phone instead and call them. After a study they proved that talking on a phone is cheaper then using the computer. In this economy why wouldn't you want to save money while getting the same thing also on a computer you don't really talk to the person you are really just typing word to them. This can be very dangerous. Who know if the person talking to you is really the person you think. Why take the risk when you can just use a phone! Using the computer is like smoking. It is very addicting! People stay on computers for hours every day and don't get exercize. If you just sit there moving your hand you are not really burning calories. This is a huge problem! Obecety is already rising with the number of fast food places and computers are making it worce. And the worst part is parents don't care some children go on the computer for @NUM1 hours a day and there parents don't encorige them to go outside. Children need encorigment to get moviing or they will never start, and they will get bigger. We need to form a group to help stop this or before you no it @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 will be obeise. Another excuse that computer lovers do is they say they are doing research on a country. Even though this @MONTH1 be true there are other way you can do this. Why not ride your bike to the library and get a book on the country. By doing this you will burn calories and get to learn the same stuff you would have on the computer. Also not everything on the internet is true so you might have false information. By getting a book you know it's true. People that love computers will never get away from them over night it @MONTH1 take a month or two but if we act new we can make a change and put a stop to it. Computers are a waste of money. You can live without then very easily, and without them the world would be a better place. People are being lazy and use excuses on why they need a computer. If you are stuck on a computer for @NUM1 hours a day you will never have any family memories. All you will remembor is when you were on the computer, and who wants that."	4	5		9																					
1192	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, I'm writing this letter to you to tell you my opinion on the effects computers have on people. My opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people. First reason is they give the ability to learn about people and places in the world. Another reason is that computers bring unity to the nation and even the world. Last reason is it can help you be organize and get a job. Now I will move on to give more details on my first reason. When I have a school project on a famous person or somewhere in the world I know that the computer will give me more information than a book. If I am doing the project on a place and I want to know how far is it from where I live to there or whats the weather of that place all I have to do is type it down in a search engine and the computer will give me a bunch of websites that will answer my question. Now, if you can't draw a picture for your biography project go on a search engine and type down the name of the person you're doing and don't for get to type down pictures or photos and you will see a bunch of pictures of that person. Now I will move on to my second reason. Computers bring unity in the nation and the world for example think about these social networks like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 these networks has millions of people on them that you can talk to. And what about the @ORGANIZATION1, webcam, where you can talk to the person face to face. Just recently there been earthquakes in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3 you can spread the news to family members or friends to tell them to support and help those in need. Now I will move on the my last reason. Computers are everywhere there's never a job that does not have a computer. That means that you need to know how to work with computers to get a job which can be."	4	4		8																					
1196	1	"Computers do not have a negitive effect on people. They keep you in touch with family, help you do work for school, also allow you to play video games and look up music. Computers can keep you in with family and friends. Find locations to where the live. How their doing and what have they been up to. It allows you to e-mail and lets you see friends that moved far away. Computers also help you to work for school. They help you find answeres to questions a teacher could ask. They help you write reports or reports in general for any subject. Also, there many site that you could go to; to help you with a book.The sites could also bring you to your schools website. That way, if you forgot your home work was you have a place to check. Even if you were absent most papers I questions are on the internet so you could make end to the homework. Another common thing computers are used ten is to weecth movies. Rather a old movie or a new release. Computers also do the same thing for music. Anything from @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 to country and back can be. or new @CAPS3 shows and music all be find. Video games are also popular. Many people play these because; people can friends. Talk to friends that they havent seen in a long time. They to not be bored. If it's raining out and nothing to to the here games. And if you one to talk to thiers always someone there to lister to you and maybe become your friend. So computers are not a waste. They can keep you in touch, you new friends get rid of find an serches everything in @CAPS4 shows, music and movies."	4	4		8																					
1198	1	"Dear to whom this @MONTH1 concern I know everybody that dont uses computers are why are people effect by the computers. Well i think computer is better then newspaper, on news papers you could find the news, well of course but wheather, houses for sale, tv casting, jobs and others just the same way as @CAPS1 but instead it like virtual. It benefits society for certain reasons it depends. some times computerscan be a negative effects on people but it also teach people how to read, write, type, learn and other. What I about we can talk to others we can see pictures of people whom we no we can google into about things we need to no, it helps when they need to find they way around the mapquest. A negative issue with having computers with internet, certain websites that are not age able. Kids be on website thier parents dont bout, looking up with boys they meet over the @CAPS1, People dying making plans with someone the next day the person is gone missing. I think if experts take away computers must kids well be mad and upset and there will be nothing more to do but play video games and go outside and these are my opinions."	3	4		7																					
1204	1	"To @CAPS1 @CAPS6 @MONTH1 concern: @CAPS2 I have been informed that you had the idea that more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits the society. I strongly disagree, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. Having computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about @CAPS3 and faraway places and even allow people to talk online with friends or family. Don't you want your children to grow up with great hand-eye coordinatio? More than @PERCENT1 parents voted yes. As shown in many statistics, adults and children that use the computer for an hour or more a day have better hand-eye coordination than a normal adult or child that only uses @CAPS6 once a week. By using the computer for more than one hour a day your typing becomes quicker and your reactions increase. Not only does typing quicker effect your computer techniques but @CAPS6 also helps you outside of your home like in sports. For exsample, if you play the sport baseball, the speed of your pitch will increase over @PERCENT2 if you use the computer for over a hour a day! If your a batter your racation to the pitch will also increase by over @PERCENT2! Just by using computer. Is time running out for your @CAPS3 project to be do? Without computers, you wouldn't get the information you need quick enough. Dr. @DR1 from @ORGANIZATION1 state ""You can get the same information on people other countries, and @CAPS3 from the computer as you can . By using the computer you get the as a book and easy. In addition, you have to buy books to get their information unlike computers where they dont you look up the you and in expensive, dont settle for less get the best! Over @PERCENT3 of @CAPS4 have old friends of family out of the state that they would still like to keep in touch with. By having a computer you can chat with them through your webcam! Instead of calling them up or sending them an email you could chat with them and still see them in the flesh! Several computer owners say, ""@CAPS5 like your actually hanging out with them!"" @CAPS6 takes over @NUM1 days at least to recieve a letter back or an email from them if they live faraway with computers @CAPS5 instant ! Wouldn't you like to talk to friends and family every day instead of waiting around for a call, email, or letter? I think yes. All in all , having computers is a great investment. I would also like to point out that without computers you wouldn't beable to talk with friends/family online, get better hand-eye cordination, or even have the ability to learn about @CAPS3 in just a click of a button! Isn't this what you want? "	4	5		9

1211	1	"Dear editor: @CAPS1 you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the @LOCATION2 have comuters? These computers are definatley benefitting society. People need computers to get updated on important issues, contact others and learn new information. Computers are neccisary for everyday life. It's very important that news gets around, and one way for it to do that is by computers. Average people like me and you need to know the weather, global issues and many other important topics. If you use the computer to get updated on important issues you will be able to acess the information right away. For example there is no need to wait for the weather to come on the television when you can find out the weather for your local area withen seconds. Just recently there was an earthquake in @LOCATION1 and million of civilians died. if a natural disaster was to happen somewhere in @CAPS2 people would need to know and computers are a great way to make sure everyone is updated. Not only does the computer help us get important updates on global issues but it is also a great way to contact people. My relatives live very far away and we can't afford the long distance phone call charge and so we e-mail them. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people contact far away friends and family by e-mail! The computer is also a great place for friends to contact each other through social networking sites, such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. People need to interact with other people and the internet is a fantastic place to do that. Finally computers can also be used to learn new information. If children need to find inforamtion for a project or essay the can easily search the internet and find an answer. Kids need to acess the information that is neccisary for school on the internet. Computers are useful for adults as well. If adults want to learn something new all they have to to is search it on the computer. It's so much easier than going out to the library and finding that information in a book. @CAPS1 you know that most adults use an online dictionary to find the definition to a word? Computers can find every answer to your questions. In conclusion, computer are really benefitting society. Computers can update you on important issues, help you contact people, and find out new informatiuon. These avandces in technology are good for human society."	4	5		9																					
1213	1	"In my opinion I agree that it benefits society. The reasons that support my decision are lots of buisnesses use computers to work, fast food resturants use computers, and schools use computers. Computers are all needed just for those reasons. My first reason is buisneses use computers to work. Workers use computers for designing, filing peoples names, and to type papers, and essays. People in the designing industry don't use paper and pencil anymore, because they use designing softwares to work. Instead of filing in a cabinet people and workers use computers to put their patients, clients, and workers. Computers can hold more information and files than cabinets can. People also type papers and essays for work. For example, news reporters have to write a report and type it for their company in order to get it to publish. If workers in buesness were to need to use computers to file, type, and design clothes and games. My second reason is that fast food resrurants or even resturants use computers, instead of using cash registers. For example @ORGANIZATION2 or @ORGANIZATION1 use technology to type in peoples orders, and amount they pay. Back then they used to use cash registers, in order to get money out they need to click a button, but now the have all locked up using computers. Every resturant has at least a touch screen computer in it to use. So resturants need computers to survive the world. My third reason is schools need computers for students and teachers to write reports, file the students name and grades into it. Students in classes write reports for projects or even for class work. Teachers need computers to file the students name, grades, and information, instead of using a cabinet. Teachers also use computers to make homework pages and they need to print stuff off of word. So schools use and need computers for students and teachers use. In conclusion I agree that computers benefit society, because buisnesses need them to work, design, and file, and fast food resturants so they can take peoples orders and to use in schools for students and teachers use. So thats why it benefits the society."	4	4		8																					
1214	1	"Dear @PERSON1, Computers are necessary and benefit our community. They do a great deal to help make our lives easier. There is not a day that we do not use a computer in some way or another. The benefits of our computers are they connect us, the spread news, and they make every day objects work. Computers connect us in so many difffrent ways. Where would businesses be without computers? Most modern day businesses are run by computers. Owners can now have businesses all over the world. With computers a business in @LOCATION2 or somewhere else in @LOCATION4 can be connected with a building in @LOCATION1. They can have live video chats together. With the help of the computers they are able to contact any branch of their business all over the world. Even smaller businesses use the computer to connect to customers. Now a days we do a lot of online shopping. This is an example of how stores connect to their customers. Stores can show buyers everything they have to offer including store locations. This can help stores get more business by connecting the buyer to the shop. The computer not only connects stores and businesses but also people to people. @PERCENT1 of kids in my school own a computer. With all these computers many social networking sites are born. The most popular right now is @CAPS1. Students can connect to old friends from other places and even other countries. We have a live chat on @CAPS1 or even @CAPS2. @CAPS2 is instant messging which is, well, instant. With a simple click people are connected no matter how far apart they are. Therefore, computers conect people. Computers also broadcast news. Without the computers most of us would not no about world news. This includes the @LOCATION3 earthquake. If we did not have the computers to let us know about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 they would be in alot more trouble. They would not have all of these donations. Also computers even broadcast national news. Almost all newspapers are now online along with on paper too. Anyday now they will be completly online. This will drastically change how we learn about news. It would just be a click away. What would have taken days to get here now takes minutes or maybe even seconds. Science also benefits from computers. Phones now can be personal tws, inernet, and messaging devises. Phones are just a tiny version of a computer. Cars also have computers put into them. The @CAPS3 in our cars are computers; we would be lost without them. Also, in cars there are computers to run just about everything else. So, there is not a day where we do not incounter computers. In conclusion, computers benefit us in so many ways. They conect us deliver news, and are in almost all of our technology. Could you imagine life without computers?"	5	5		10																					
1222	1	"Computers. First of all. I strongly beleave that people should not use computers all the time. Staying up to late, like on a school day and your tired. Your eyes look at black & white words that can make your tired, forcing to stay up, and drinking red bull monster, or any other energy drink when your not suppose to. Second of all, almost the hole school use's the labtops, and the computers like @PERCENT1 use's them. The othe <@PERCENT2@NUM1> is students and adults write on paper, and that has good hand and combination. the @PERCENT1 is like all people go online, facebook, youtube, games, and google. The @PERCENT2 is all people use to write on their paper, and doodle on the back round. Third of all. In other state's people don't have enternet service, or they can't use computer. People have to write their work on a piece of paper. Some kids, youngadults, adults, and students sometimes have bad hand writing. I think all people should not have a computer."	3	3		6																					
1231	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers have good effects on people such as letting people talkto family or friends that live faraway. Computers also let you learn about different places and people around the world. My first reason is that computers let you learn about different places and people around the world. This helps you if you are going on vacation to foreign country you can learn where the test historical sights are and you can also learn where the best hotels are. If you have a project due on a foreign country you can search it up and it will give you all the data you need about it. My second reason is that computers let you talk to family or friends that live faraway. This helps you keep in touch so it doesn't seem like you don't know them any more. Computers can also let you talk to your friends that live faraway and if you want to hangout it would let you talk about which days are good for you and them."	3	3		6																					
1232	1	"Advancements in technology are very practical and have a positive effect on those fortunate enough to have a computer. First, computers help reach people to have better hand-eye coordination. @CAPS1, computers make it simple to learn new information about many things such as people and places across the globe. finally, computers allow people in different places to communicate instantly for the reasons above, computers are very helpful to people all around the world. One of the ways computers help people is through improving their hand eye coordination when a person learns to type and look at a screen at the same time. They will be able to do sample everyday asks much better. Is a person does not have good hand-eye coordination. They cannot ever make on the ones of a paper properly! This also, with focus, and people with better focus excel in school, work and their social lives. Hand-eye coordination is very important to learn and computers help to teach it to people. The @CAPS1 reason that I think computers people to learn about new. I myself and through have know many proces. My now lucky I to be able to realize how, and the research is because of computers. Computers are aducating. Finally, computers handy because they telephone. One way communication in computers is my instant. This is when they type and this is similar to a telephone conversation, but free of charge. The final and most popular way is video chat. Video chat is when the people use cameras connected to their computers and can talk to each other while seeing each other's face! All these ways of communicating with people around the world are very beneficial to many people, especially those with family or friends living in another town. Without a doubt, computers benefit people in society in many ways. They teach them hand eye coordination which is very important for simple, everyday tasks they also help people everywhere in the world learn about that they couldnt learn about with books. Last but not least, computers people are world in communicate with each other. In all these ways, computers help people everywhere and."	5	5		10																					
1243	1	"Dear all computer lovers, i do think you are all spending too much time on the computer. yes, it is good to go on the computer and learn new fact, watch funny videos, and also basicly everything is on the computer these days. But most people spend to much time on the computer. you need to be doing three things, enjoy nature spending time with family and friends and most importantly, exercise. In this letter I will be explaing why you need these things, wich you cant get on the computer. First, i will be explainig why it is important to enjoy nature. Sometimes, enjoying nature can be difficult but if we all look closer it can be really fun. Some examples of nature are trees, grass, the fresh air. But I am sure all of my fellow teenagers would agree that, that is very boring we would all rather sit and watch tv. Some examples of making of making nature fun is instead of looking at a boring tree, you can climb the tree and maybe you can go outside and play with your dog and lay in the grass. One example of my favorite things to do in nature, is when I say up all night I run outside very early and lay in the grass, breathe in the fresh air and watch the sun came up. Secondly, and every importanrt that you get off the computer and spend time with family and friends. Fa mily, can do @MONTH1 things with you and I know that I am very happy when I am with family because they always make me laugh and most importantly my family loves to party. Partys are always fun ecspecially when your are with family. Freinds are also great to be with because they make you laugh have adventures and are always there for you."	5	4		9

1256	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In the @DATE1 the world has changed so much, for the better. Technology has become so advanced, there are new cures for for different diseases. Computers are one of these great benefits. They let you communicate quicker. You can keep up with family members and old friends. You can also talk to different people who live in another state, country, or continent. These a quote that says ""communication is key."" I'll put that into more details in my next paragraph. I remember one time long ago, the only way to communicate was by letters or you would have to walk. Now wih computers with just one email or an instant message. Someone can get your messgae in. By sending a letter it can take a while. Even if you and call some one they @MONTH1 not be home or answer. But you can get emails and instant message ways. It also doesn't cost to send long distnace. Which will be bring yo my next topic. A profressor at @ORGANIZATION2 once said ""Computers are taking time "" But, if you think about it what it's actually doing is reconnecting with family members and old friends. For example, you @MONTH1 move and not be able to see them again. Then, you get a new phone number and forget other people number. If you have a computer you go on this great social networking side called where you look up some old friends name and distant realtives and you find out that it's really them. Than they you to other family members and before you know it you all to other again. Now, I'll bring to you my @DATE1 topic. The world wide web is a big place were peolple from all over the. On the world wide web you can meet some new people who not live in your state, or country. But, you find that you are starting to click when you meet this person they @MONTH1 be of a different rare. Thats ok you can learn new thing about a different cuture. While you two @MONTH1 have something in common you can share other things you like to do which you can try, so you're learning something new while having fun at the same time. Now you'll see it's time you get a computer rather than never have the experience. With a computer you can communcate quicker. You can reconnect with distant relatives and old friends. You can also talk to different people who like you."	4	4		8																					
1258	1	"Dear readers, On the current debate of the effects of computers, I believe they strongly benefit all people. For example on some computers a business software can be incorporated, allowing a meeting to be help over the computers. Not only is it convienent, but this saves money. Also, computers come with built in programs that can help keep track of you expenses. These are simple and save lots of time. Plus, computers also help you stay in touch with friends. Even if they are @NUM1 miles away you can click a button and have a live video chat! First off, the business software on new computers are out of this world. You can make a brochure of sales and expenses, all with an easy stroke on the mouse. This is a cheaper and greener way of presenting ideas. Furthermore, on the computer you and all you clients can hold a conference call. Doing this allows you to relax and multitask while your computer is feeding you coverage of the call in crystal-clear sound. Normally a phone would have to be glued to you ear but now you hands free. Another time where computers are handy is at tax time. Tired of running around your house to find you car bill from three months ago? Well, with a spreadsheet software like @ORGANIZATION1, taxes can be calculated in along with their name, so when you take the taxes to tax consultant, everything is organized. Using these tools cut down an stress and leaves you less frustrated. And even better, you can buy a tax program for you computer, so you never have to leave your couch! Think about, paying somebody to count your taxes year after year, when you can save a fortune and do it yourself. Above all, computers help you connect with old friends who have moved away or parted ways earlier in life. Now, the internet contains many social networking sites, such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 where you can reunite with lost pals. These networks also offering access to photosharing and chat, so everybody can see how your family is and vice versa. Along with this is video chatting, where you can have face to face conversation with somebody even on the other side of the world. This is totally private, so it isn't dangerous to say names of family members or their locations. The internet truly is an amazing tool! To conclude, the internet holds a very strong role in our daily lives. Not only can we see who man the @ORGANIZATION2 game, but it also has interactive business softwares as well. Never again will work be so difficult. Also, the computer has programs to help you manage expenses, keeping you on top of your game. Finally, it is also helpful for all the tools that can be used to interact with friends thousands of miles away. I believe the computer is critical for success and happiness in life. It's a new age, let's adapt to it."	6	6		12																					
1266	1	"Guess what! Do you like to use computers well I do and I think it benfits society for a couple of reasons. It is good to use to get information on things, to meet people and just to expose the internet and if you keep on reading @CAPS1 ill tell you why think that. One reason I think it benfits society because how in this lifetime you need to know what is going on in the world. So instead of you always watching the news or reading newspaper. You could go on the internet and see what is going on from the internet. Thats why I think it benfits society today. A second reason is haveing a computers poeple get to talk over the web and meet new poeple. Being able to talk online to people like faimly and your friends. That you havent seen or heard from in a long time. And you don't have thier number you will tot alk to them during they are on the internet. A third reason is haveing a computer and is always on it. You can explore the internet and get facts on poeple, things, and places that you never knew about and from you going on the internet you learn more things that tou never knew before. A fourth reason is by haveing a computer you can go to school on the internet. And you dont have to leave your house because you can go to school from there and by doing that most poeple could stay out of trouble because there not leavinf there house. Unfortunally I ahve to end this letter but has mush reasons and details I gave ou on why I think haveing a computer is a good idea. You will agree with me and why I think that."	4	4		8																					
1267	1	"In my opinion i think computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow you to communicate will people from anywhere in the world. You can learn about different places much faster than you would if you read a book. Also many more jobs want people with computer skills. It is also fun and educational. Can you imagine how much harder it would be to communicate with someone who lives in, lets say @LOCATION1. It would be a lot harder, dont you think? Well thanks to computers it is as easy as turning on your computer. Many teachers enjoy doing activities with penpals. That would be a lot harder if you had to write letters. It would also cost a lot more money to call. Also, if you were looking for specific information about florida it is alot easier on a computer. You just type in what it is you are looking for, rather than reading through tons of books, in which case you might not even find what you are looking for. Also the computer has millions of iinformation. The computer also has various pictures which is also good. Another good reason is that many more jobs these days want to hire someone who knows how to work with computers. You can do a lot more things on a computer that you cant do on a piece of paper. For example make animated movies and video games. These things have evolved over the years thanks to computers. Finally my last reason, its not only educational its also fun. Sure you can research information and do you rhomework on the computer, but you can also play games. Computers can do all sorts of different things. Computers can be programed to have simulations for jobs like policemen ambulance drivers, and doctors. These are all things that save lives. That is why i think computers have a positive effect on people. Without computers our country probably wouldn't be as evolved as it is today."	4	4		8

My opinion is that computers do benefit society. Computers help everyone a lot. First, we can learn about the places we want to go to. We want to learn about the places so we can travel there. However, when we know a lot about that place we might want to but our plane tickets threw the computer site then after you get the plane tickets you can go and discover the places/place. Second, in a couple years everything will be computers. However, @CAPS3 will be threw a computer site (world wide web). We will get our education online. There will be games online. Computers do benefit society. Lastly, computers make life easier. They make life easier because instead of picking up a phone to call your friends or family you can go online to talk, they also make life easier beacuse instead of going to your family or friends house you can go on to aim or what ever chat site you got and chat threw instant messaging.

1289	1	"The effect people shouldn't be on the computers that much because you need exercising to keep you healthy. You wouldn't be learn anything if you play games on it all day. Your brain will be fousing on the computers than school. You would be a bored kid or adult if you keep doing this. It will be sad if you throw your life away just because of a computers. The effect on people on the computer by not knowing technology is some people think that technology is dumb because you have a brain instead of a computers have information in your brain if you are smart. Some people are poor and never had a computer or never heard technology and country some of them don't even have technology or electrion because they can't afford for a computers. The effect that they don't know technology is they can find location and no cellphone you can call your friend go online and listen to music, play games chat to friend and family. Play games with each other. And watch movies. Another effect is learning about computers and how to use it step one turn it on. Click on intert explorer and search on a website to go on it's kind of hard to use the keyboard and typing it fast. The last effect is talking to people that you don't know form online. Is playing the game with a diffrent player you can chat with that person. Conulison this is all my reason why I agree with the effect of a computer have postive reason for a lot of people. This is why I agree with the effect of the computer."	4	3		7																					
1294	1	"Imagine our beautiful town filled with unhealthy, lazy, noninteracting and addicted people. The issue to grapple with is should you the local people, spend more time on computers or not, I believe @PERCENT1 that we should not spend all of our time on computers. It can ruin your eye sight, you don't enjoy nature while interacting with people, and most importantly it make you very unhealthy. Can you picture @CAPS1 person in your town blind and having glasses or even going to the @CAPS1 @DATE1? Just ask eye @PERSON1,"" @CAPS1 year I get and more people coming to the eye doctors. You might say that it is good for me but it is not good for you. When you are always on the computer it erodes you eye-sight over time. ""@CAPS2, many people wear glasses now more then ever. @DATE1 @DATE1 in the local newspaper, they had a chart that showed how many people ruined their eyesight over the years from computers. It went up almost @PERCENT2 from @DATE1 year and @PERCENT3 from the year before. Almost everyone that has a computer and is addicted to it has glasses. Have you looked outside lately? Have you notice that @DATE2 is coming and there is leaves on the tree now? If you were one of the people that is glued to the monitor of your computer then I doubt you were. Computers and technology ruin your time with your family. Many jobs on the computer how out it isn't a @NUM1 job. In that time you could be spending time with your precious little girl or even the best friend out side in nature having fun. @DATE1 year I wanted to play catch with my dad, but was on his old computer doing what he does. I didn't want to play alone so I just stayed inside and went on my computer for the day. Do you want that to happen to @CAPS1 person, everyday I wouldn't. Yes, people would rather be a couch potatoe and chat online, eating a bug of a million junk food chips instead of going out and interacting while slaying fit, but now it is important that you do. Just picture lazy, obese. People sitting on their couch all day with their eyes blood from stearing at the monitor for hours. But why do you than you @MONTH1 ask, it is because they never some outside. They never go for a jog or eat healthy foods. That is very unhealthy and can higher your chances of getting different cancers. Just ask @PERSON2 from the hospital,"" @DATE1 one guy was rushed to the hospital because of a very common cancer that you get from unhealthy living, he passed away @NUM2 days later. It was very sad."" I strongly believe that being on the computer to long is a very bad idea. It can ruin you eye-sight, you never get to see nature and interact. But most importantly, it is very unhealthy. It is now or never, You would never know if you can be that man in the hospital with that cancer. The issue to grapple with is should you take that risk or stay fit, healthy and happy? So take a joy, eat a healthy, snack, and limit your time on the computer."	5	4		9																					
1301	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people and others are disagreering with this comment. In my point of view I believe that computers are effecting some people today and that people are spending a hudge amount of time on computers. The time spent on computers is getting outragous! Many people are just sitting home and staying on thier computer just playing games. Although the computer can be a great way to pay bills and come in contact with others faraway, people are taking advantage of computers and even billing others online. Since your not right infront of the person or near by the computer is a tool for many people to say threatning things without anyone else knowing which could cause fights, or other terrible things. The computer can also be very dangerous in many ways. For example sites like myspace and twitter can be dangerous for teens because of rapest. Some random person colud just start talking to you and ask you to meet them some where which could be dangerous. The computer is also dangerous because you could have inappropriate pictures posted on websites of you and not even know @CAPS1! The last reason why computers and laptops effect people is because of hacking. This is a big issue especially if you have a webcam. Some people know how to back your webcame and can watch what your doing without you knowing. People can also hack into your computer and look at all your documents. I think computers is a big effect on people today and this effect should be solved!"	4	4		8

Well now its this advance machine called a computer. Its very great and its a well hands on activity, that helps you with eye cornation. However, @CAPS1 going to tell you somethings about this device and now it affects humuns daily life. Moreover, the catogories are have a great relationship, online cources, and be on the best local websites. Did you know about @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have a successful life with online-dating. There's tons of people who struggle with relationships. For example, one day my mom and dad got into a series of arguments. She felt that the relationship wasn't good enough and she needed to meet a better man. On the other hand, she decided to live a better life and find dates (over the computer) and live a new life. These are the fantastic things you can do on the computer to have a better relationship. Your a highschool dropout because you cant keep up with the class. You dont turn in your homework and fail every test. Also, you feel that there is nothing you can do to fix it. Well not so fast my son! Now you can take online cources to boost up your grade and make you feel comfortable. Imagine sitting at the computer, completing every assignment and doing every homework there is. Watching your teacher teach, to you through a webcam. There's nothing like it, in fact you get the homework faxed to you. Someone in this world is living this life, it could be you. There's new websites all around the world today. However, there is no better website with all your friends on it. For example, myspace, facebook, and twitter. All websites that can stay in contact with your best friends. Another, that can be even more intrested is webcam. It's live from home fotage face to face on the computer. How cool is seeing your friend when your not together? Third of all, communication makes the world go around that why more and more people meet new friends. In sum, as you can see there's a lot of fun things you can do on a computer. It affects humans lives because more and more people are intrested in this device"	5	4		9																					
1321	1	"Dear newspaper readers, @CAPS1 this! Sitting at home on the couch eating a bag of potato chips. The @CAPS2 shows a beautiful picture of the @LOCATION1 you can almost feel the rain falling on you, you really want to learn more about it. All of a sudden you watch the remote fall to the ground you hand eye coordination is so bad you totally miss it when you try to grab it. On top of that, you remember you were supposed to meet your sister today who you seen for years but you can’t! if you had a computer you would be to learn about more places and people, it would improve your hand eye coordination, and you could interact with people without having time to meet them! Computers definitely have good effects on people! First, computers help to improve hand-eye coordination. It is a fact that people who own one or more computers in a household have better hand-eye coordination than people without computers! Don’t you want good hand-eye coordination too? As a matter of fact, my friend @PERSON4 had the worst hand-eye coordination in our school, now that her parents have bought her a computer, she is a lot quicker and definitely has better hand-eye coordination. She said that just looking at the screen and she wanted to go helped a lot. Also, computer time can states that computers have been proven to improve hand-eye coordination in the course of a year. that sounds pretty simple to me! Next, computers also  allow people to learn about other faraway places and people. Local middle school teacher, @PERSON2, uses computers to teach her students about the @CAPS3 culture and geography. That sounds a lot more interesting than just talking! My cousins saw an article about @LOCATION3 once and they thought it was amazing they learned a lot about the culture there and actually took a trip there! Furthermore, vacations.com says that computers are the #@NUM1 cause of people traveling, because they see pictures and articles about places. You can learn about any place you want on a computer, doesn’t that sound nice? I’m sure there is one place you’ve always wanted to learn about! Finally, computer allow people to interact with other people around the world You can talk with your long lost friend who lives in @LOCATION2 just by the click to the mouse,(send). In a recent study, over @PERCENT1 of people just talk online to their friends rather than going out to meet them. How convenient! Also, expert computer teacher, @PERSON1, says, “Computers are geat inf you can't meet someone, you just talk online”. Have you ever needed to cancel a meeting? Computer are really beneficial to busy people. Now readers, @CAPS1, your sitting on that same couch you look at the @CAPS2 to see @LOCATION1, you quickly type it into your laptop and an article right in front of you read more about it learning something new in every paragraph. All of a sudden you lose your grip, but you catch your laptop just in time, what hand-eye coordination! Then you remember you were supposed to meet you sister @PERSON3, but you have a hair appointment. You quickly tell her via computer you cant meet her. She says it’s alright and you guys keep chatting it all worked out! It’s so simple! Computers teach hand-eye coordination, let you learn about more places, and interact with more people. So what are you doing readers? Get out there and get a computer."	5	4		9																					
1324	1	"Dear local Newspaper, I think people using a computer has a effect. using a computer can help people in many ways. You can talk to people world wide, it helps you stay organized, and you can create very useful things like a or a power point using a computer. Talking to people world wide can be a very useful thing. Say that you have family members that live in @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2 you can keep in touch with them by e-mail or video chat. Also, if there is a national and nedds to talk to the other, governers around the world for advices help he can do that quickly and easily. Using a computer can also help you stay organized. For example my uncle helps file takes computer to make sure all of the files get saved and they are in the light places. Imagine all of the papers and space he would use if he had to do by hand or didnt use a computer. Computers also help teachers. Teachers enter grades, e-mail parents, and even create test or quizes and they know it will be nice and organized in the computer files instead of in paper files on their desk. Speaking of quizzes that teachers make on the computer, they can also make alot of other things like power points. Power points can help them put alot of information on the screen and it helps the students learn, which is a positive effect. If you had a small business that just started out you can make a brochure to help advertising. Lastily, you can go on microsoft excel and make a schedule that can help your employees know who has to work when, or students can know what class they have to be in at what time. In conclusion, computers are very helpful in everyday for alot of different people. Talking to worldwide can help you stay in, so you dont lose connection with your. They also have effect they help business people stay organized. Lastly, they can help teachers create test or powerpoints which helps kids learn. So in all, I would have to agree that computers have a positive effect on society. Also, doesn't typeing your newspaper articles make it more organized and quicker to print them?"	4	4		8

I cant even remember the last time I went a day without a computer. All of this talk about computer being bad for society really got thinking. There is no way possible that computers are bad. for example computers are good for motor skills and what about school work computers help a lot when you forget your homework log at school and lastly sociability! I don't know about you but I couldn't live without computers! Computers teach hand-eye coordination! which we all know we need to play sports! Also with all the typing you do there is definatly some exercise for your wrists! I should know that they do because I woke both my wrists, at the same time and when I went to rehab they told me I should try getting my wrists back to normal by typing and having of calcium but that's another story. Computers are also great for school say that you forget your homework log at school so you don't know what you had for homework well you could call a friend but wouldn't adjust be easier to go online to the teachers webpage? teachers always have there homeworks listed on a school web page. And no you realize you forgot your mathbook to! have no fear the online textbook is here! and thats a lot easier then going back to the school to get it! don't you think? Lastly when you have a big project you can do research on anything and everything in the world! from ants to @LOCATION2 its all there. Here's a big benifit to society for you on all of the social networking sites such as facebook myspace and so man more arn't you able to leave comments on friends profiles or even chat with them! Which brings me to tm my next topics chatting on the computer! There is @CAPS2 and like I said before you can even chat on social networking sites. And lets say that you arn't able to watch the news cant you go online and check that to! There are so many social things to do on the computer and those are just some. So I hope those @PERCENT1 of people and even people that don't own computers are on my side. So we can prove that computers are good for motor skills, school work and even social networking. So please be on my side so we can show the public that computers are social!"	4	4		8																					
1334	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are an amazing piece of technology, but some people are beginning to abuse the @CAPS2. There are many benefits to having a computer. In my opinion I think that computers help people out a lot such as looking up directions or even chatting with some old friends. But many People are abusing the @CAPS2 and not @CAPS1 when to get off. The @CAPS2 is a very fun thing to be on but when your on it for too long, you miss out on family acvivitys, hanging out with friends etc. I think that there should be a time limit for everyone on the computer. If we had something that would shut off othe computer but save everything you were doing, People would go out more and be more active. Eventhough people @MONTH1 be learning about things on the computer, you have to know when to get off. Now on the @CAPS2 there are websites where you can watch exercize videos or if you even want to buy some exercize equiptment etc. The @CAPS2 can be a pretty handy thing but you dont want to be on it for long periods of time. I believe that having a computer can be a very cool thing to have and very useful when you need it. But there should be time limits for how long people stay on the computer."	4	4		8																					
1336	1	"Dear local newspaper, A question that recently came to my attention is people are spending to much time on the computer, and if this is a good thing, I believe that computers are a good electronic item to have. I think this because, it helps people learn. Also, people can keep in touch with their friends even if they I've in a different country. In addition, it can help people or students be @CAPS1 please consider this in our newspaper. Would you like students/people to have internet and searches that can help them learn? The answer is ""yes"". Having to computers can help students to learn. They can go onto @LOCATION2 and type in any question they want to be answered. Picture this a child has a question that she wants answered, but she is embarrased to ask her parents. She can simply type the question in on her computer and get hundreds of answers. There is nobody in the world that knows everything, but there are computers that do. Computers can give you the answer to any question. When my mom was little she didn't have access to a computer all the time. @CAPS1 when she had a question she would have to ask somebody she know. If they didn't know the answer than she couldn't know the answer. If more people had computers then they would the to questions. Computers are a good way to keep in touch with people. These are @CAPS4 programs such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, aim, ect.. My dad owns a buisness and needs to be in touch with people for seven @CAPS1 he around his iphone to talk to them by email. It helps my dad know when pappers and whos asking on what. I asked ten adults if they think everyone should have to a computer and ten out of ten said ""yes."" @CAPS4 people think that friends and family important and should stay with them every and a while. I have a friend who lives in @LOCATION1, but I cant contact her with my phone because are doesnt me and her talk on @CAPS2 all the time. @CAPS1 if people dont own phones then you can still stay in contact with computers. if they far away. Do you have perfect handwriting? The answer is probably no. People use @ORGANIZATION1 all the time because there handwriting isn't Computers help people stay clean and tidy. Computers have of folders and programs to store information you need. This all stays next all on the computer. My friend just get a computer for her office. Before she got it one hand everything and kep them all her desk in a mess. She had filled with pappers. But after she got a computer she typed everything neatly and kept all her pappers in the folders of her computer. She was @CAPS1 neat and clean that she got promoted. My friends moms changed because she got a computer. She became and cleaner. Picture this you are overwhelmed by all the papers on your desk. You dont know what papper is what. Well if you had a computer you could type eerything and keep them in your computer files. also @PERCENT1 of adults staying is good. I know you the local newspaper, have a very hard job and decision to make. I beileve that computers are good and helpful. Because they can help people find information they need. Also, they can keep people in touch with buisness workers, friend, students, family, ect. In addition, computers can help people get neat and clean. @CAPS1 please consider puting my essay in the Newspaper."	5	5		10

1358	1	"@CITY1 @CAPS1, Computers are very helpful devices. Life would be very hard without them. Not only are the helpful, but they are fun and easy to use! I believe that computers have a great effect on people because you can keep in touch with family and friends, go on school websites and use search engines. Friends and family are extremely important in peoples lives. Computers can help you keep in touch with them! the @NUM1 applications that I mostly use are @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3. @ORGANIZATION1 is a free online application that you can download to your computer, add your friends, and video chat! using this, I keep in touch with my @CAPS4, my friend who moved, and even a friend from @LOCATION2! @CAPS2 (@ORGANIZATION3 instant messeger) is where you can send messages to friends and get instant replies! It is just like text messaging, only through computers. Lastly, @CAPS3 is a website where you can add friends from all around the world! I am friends with tons of family that I don't get to see very often, a friend who moved to @LOCATION3, and many other people that have moves! @CAPS3, @CAPS2, and @ORGANIZATION1 are great ways to keep in touch with other people! When you are home sick from school and need to make up school work, instead of calling a friend from each of your classes, go to the school's webpage! All teachers should have their own website that you can get from there. On their pages, they should have posted homework, quizzes/tests schedule, favorite links, projects, and their e-mail address. I find this very helpful because even if you don't understand you homework, you can e-mail you teacher! Not only do school website have teachers pages, but they also have lunch menus, events coming up, the school address and phone number, and many more! School could be a lot more difficult without a website. Do you ever have a question but nobody has the answer to it? www.Google.com has the answer to everything! you can find webpages, videos, pictures, translators, etc. Google is not the only search engine on the internet, there is also @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION2!, @LOCATION4, @CAPS7, @LOCATION1, etc. These can all help you find answers, pictures, videos and many more! I often use these to find pictures for a school project, webpages for research, translators to check my spanish homework and videos to show my friends! if we did not have search engines, life would be a lot harder. Computers, as you can tell, are extremely helpful, easy, and fun to use. People love them and use them all the time. I hope that you agree with computers having a great effect on people! Staying in touch with family and friends, having a good education, and finding answers within a click is the easiest way to go!"	6	5		11																					
1380	1	"Dear local newspaper, I has come to my attention that many of us disagree on weather computers have a negative or positive effect on people. I believe that computers do not benefit society. Many people in today's modern world spend way to much time on the computer when they could be exercising, spending time with family and friends, and enjoying nature. Read on and I am sure you will agree. First of all, computers are becoming a problem in society because they interfear with our physical well being. The @LOCATION1 is continuingly growing. Not in our population but the size of our people! According to a recent survey @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people in the @LOCATION1 are overweight or obease. ""The main culprit of the @ORGANIZATION2's percent of obeasity is not over eating it is actually electronics! Especially things like computers."" said @PERSON1 a surgean at @ORGANIZATION1, after dealing with a severe case of obesity. Obesity is not a hard thing to get rid of. All we have to do is instead of sitting for hours staring at a screen. America needs to get outside! It can be as simple as riding a bike or taking your dog for a walk. Whatever you do just get off your computer and go outside or the gym for exercise! Secondly, computers interfere with family and friends. I know from personal experience that parents hate it when their kids will miss family dinner or won't go out with their friends because they ""need"" to finish the next level on their game or they ""need"" to look something up on the internet. Family and friends should be a very important thing in your life but unfortunatly, for most people it is not. Psycologist, @PERSON2 has discovered that overall, having family and friends that you can count on beside you will make you a much happier more enjoyable person."" @CAPS1 eliminating computers from our lives we will create a happy and more pleasent society for the people of the @LOCATION1. Doing everyone a favor. Furthermore, if we cut back on our hours on the computer we will have a better chance to expeirence the wonder's mother nature has to offer us. Most people don't realize how much they are missing @CAPS1 not going outside. There are amazing things, right in your own backyard, that you will probably never get to expeirience because you are too addicted to playing on the computer. @NUM3 years ago people were able to function fine with out computers so we should be able to too. @PERCENT1 of people have never even been camping! So next time you feel like spending another @NUM4 hours on the computer, take a walk and I'm sure you will be amazed at what you find outdoors. In conclusion, computers do not benefit society. They just keep people away from going outside, enjoying nature and spending time with family and friends. I hope I have convinced you to see my side of the argument and thank you for your time."	6	6		12																					
1383	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 register, I am writting you to urge you that the affect computers have people is helpful. The reason I say the computers are helpful is because it helps give direction helping the economy and because you can send messages thru quickly (instant messaging). Read on so I could let you know how and why these things about the computer are helpful. @CAPS7 I know I said computers help gives direction but let me explain it like this. You know when you need to go out somewhere far and you don't know how to act there and have no @CAPS3 in your car. Well then think about it on computer is your only option left. Like for example when I was going down south @DATE1 we didn't have no @CAPS4.P.S and we didn't know how to get their. So our only option was the computer. We logged on to google on found our direction @NUM1. So this is the first reason @CAPS7 read the next on. Okay, okay, okay. @CAPS7 we all know the way our economy is rediculous. Away computers helping our economy is instead of people driving to go pay there bills, they could pay online. Because it's saving money and the state won't have to pay for questions to get gas for the cars often or get re-build. Like for example this gas station near my house is getting re-built because something went wrong with the pipes @CAPS7 this is costing us all about @MONEY1. @CAPS7 say this isn't away we could save the economy. Its about time to move to the next reason. Listen here, here, here's my @DATE1 reason how computers are helpful. Im other known as instant messaging. This is helpful if you don't have a house phone nor on cellphone and you wanna tell you a family member or friend something really bad had happened then you could tell thru by instant messaging (@CAPS5) because they would surely would get it. Like one time my friend aint have a house phone nor cellphone and somebody was trying to brake into her house she had instant message me to let me know because it could get send to my cellphone. And I called her mom to let her know and befor I know it another massage was coming thru saving ""@CAPS6 you."" @CAPS7 after reading how computers are helpful by helping give direction, save the economy and instant messaging, could you agree with me saying computers are helpful. Its still your opinion but you read minds so think about what you read on say it isn't true."	4	5		9																					
1387	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 we all know more and more people are using computers. Some believe that this would be a concern because it affects peoples health. I believe that with the advances in technology it would give us positive effects on people. Here are three reasons why, first would be that with advances in tech. It would teach us to be more intelligent. Second would be it it would give us the ability to have access to intresting things we can't get at the library like biographics and finally access to communicate online. My first reason @CAPS2 I mentioned before was it would give us intelligence. If we have questions to something we dont know we could search on the computer and find our answer. We would learn this and would be able to teach others. The computer can give us alot of useful information that can benefit us in the future. My second reason is that advance in tech. would help us because it give us access to helpful website that teaches us. Not all information is found in the library the computer has access to biographics educational website and most important the access to educational advances for example online tutoring for students with difficulties in school. My third and final reason why advance in tech. would and could benefit us is that it gives us access to online communication. Some people will have e-mail for good reason for example teachers have e-mail for educational cause if a student is having problem in work, the student simply send the teacher a e-mail of the what the students difficulty is and what the student can do. That is all I have to say for now. I hope you think about this"	3	4		7																					
1393	1	"Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 when you were a kid? There weren't any computers or other electronics except the telephone. The computer is very advanced and helps people in many different ways, such as: hand-eye cordination, learning and being able to talk online. These things benefit society and prove the advancement in technology. The computer teaches hand-eye cordination when people don't even realize @CAPS5, through typing whether typing an email or an essay your hands are working and helping you. The hand-eye cordination that people learn on a computer can be used for sports. @PERSON3, a @NUM1 years old tennis player, said, ""I used to go on the computer everyday and play tennis later, and eventually the computer helped use with my favorite sport."" Hand-eye cordination is very useful, for many things our surveyed @NUM2 people and @NUM3 of these people say that hand-eye cordination is a very important still and that everyday activities, such as computers, help them improve. Typing is very comonly used while sending emails because they are fast, fun, and let you comunicate. When talking on a computer there are many new ways that are popular and fast, such as email welcoms aim, facebook and many more. @CAPS5 is nice to be able to talk to friends and family online because other options are more expensive. For example, many live on @LOCATION1 and her sister, @PERSON4, she is very close to, lives in @LOCATION3. They can't talk to each other a lot because neither of their calling plans allow them to call without charging hundreds of more money. They also can't fly to use each other because plane tickets are expensive these days. Also, the economy isn't doing that great, so they couldn't stay in-touch until webcams come out. Now, they see each other almost every week. Many said, ""I was considering flying to @LOCATION3, but now the webcams and email are useful and save us both a lot of money."" People @MONTH1 argue that you can just sent letters to each other, but, you can't send your baby boys first steps that you just video taped, or a youtube video that is really cute. Also, you can meet new people online that you @MONTH1 not've seen normally and when you can stay in touch, you can stay much closer to each other. Even though computers are great for fun, working and learning are much easier online. When online, everything that can be learned is amazing whether @CAPS5's what means or the earthquake in @LOCATION4. Being able to keep track of everything in one computer is amazing. @PERSON2, a @NUM4 @CAPS3 teacher at @LOCATION2, says, ""@CAPS4, we are trying to make more things electronic to protect the planet, so use don't waste paper and will trees."" @CAPS5 is true, about @PERCENT1 of the homework of @NUM5 graders is online, whether @CAPS5 is to look up the equation for photosynthesis on to find out what year @CAPS6 died in being online does help the environment @CAPS5 is important to be able to have computers in schools because @CAPS5 gives more chances for kids to learn more things faster, like @NUM6 graders have a math class online, off hey math. @CAPS5 gives people more information coming from more people. Online, you can read a scientists' expierement or a paparatzi's take on @PERSON1' new boyfriend. The computer has changed society a lot, for the better. Now, in the @DATE1, computers are part of the everyday lives of people in which they benefit. With better hand-eye cordination, being able to talk your friends, and being able to learn the computer benefits society."	5	6		11

1415	1	"Dear computer experts, @CAPS1 this: A family of four is sitting in a small dark room, not talking, not laughing, just sitting lazily in their chairs, hunched over & bored. They aren’t communicating with any of their friends, and aren’t really doing anything at all. They sit there like lumps. This would happen @CAPS5 we banned computers! Computers defenetly have positive effect on people because they feed you a constant stream of knowlage, they develop good hand eye coordination, and they enable the people who use them to communicate with others. Clearly, they are a positive addition to our world. To begin, computers bring you constant a stream of knowlage. My close friend @PERSON1 told me recently that she is sometimes sitting at home, and doing her homework, and she needs to look up something. She simply grab her computer, and the information is delivered to her with the click of a button. @CAPS5 she didn’t have a computer sheld never obtain such knowlage. Second, in a survey of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of total computer usage is looking up information, and gaining knowlage. This statistic shows that computers defenetly help them when looking for information. Also a recent @ORGANIZATION3 article on computer usage states that @CAPS5 people didnt have computers, half of the world’s discoveries would not be around today. You can tell that the amount of knowlage that computers give us is very important! Next, using computers builds hand eye coordination as well. Children’s specialist @PERSON3 says, “@CAPS4 need to be able to play video games, even though they are usually discouraged on the computer. They build fantastic hand eye coordination, and help with many things including @ORGANIZATION1 & sports.” @CAPS5 there were no computers, this hand eye coordination could never developed! Also, at @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1, they limited computer use, and as a result of it, the sports teams there all got losing records. Could this be because of the lack of hand eye coordination of those students? Additionally, at @ORGANIZATION1, after a recent survey, it was discovered that @NUM1 students who play video games on their computers do better in gym class because of the added hand eye coordination. Clearly computers greatly build hand eye coordination. Lastly, using computer allows people to communicate with each other through email & other social networks. After a poll from www.@CAPS6.com, we have discovered that millions of users use the computer & @CAPS6 to communicate everyday. We wouldn’t want to deny them of this, would we? Secondly, a friend of mine, @PERSON2, who goes to @ORGANIZATION4, says that the main way that she communicates with her friends & makes plans with them is by computer. @CAPS5 she didn’t have one, none of this could be done. Furthermore, a recent article by @PERSON4 a teen specialist at @ORGANIZATION5 says that when people don’t have computers & can’t communicate or talk to the outside world, they are more prone to diseases & sickness like depression or anorexia. When they don’t talk as much with their friends, these sicknesses are more prone to occur. This defenetly shows that communicating with computers is very important. Now, @CAPS1 this. The same family as before is sitting in bright, sunny room their computer screens flashing merrily. One of the boys calls out, “hey, look at his “ and the rest of his family rushes to his side. Their faces aglow with this @ORGANIZATION3 information. You can see that computers have a positive effect on people because they bring @ORGANIZATION3 information, they build hand eye coordination, and they allow you to communicate with others. So, computer specialists, what are you waiting for? Go to your computers right now & learn some @ORGANIZATION3 things!"	6	6		12																					
1418	1	"Dear Newspaper, I am writing to you @DATE1 because think computers really effect people in a bad way. I say this becuause @CAPS1 you go on the internet you do not get that much excirse. You also don't get good grades at all! That's bad thing. Plus when on a computer there are some really wierd people. I really want you guys to hear out my story. Go outside! @CAPS3 mom I'm on the computer! @CAPS1 your on the computer to much you want want to get exersce. @CAPS1 you don't get excise you won't be healthy! you want get excise. Also you will obese you don't want that! For instance when your in gym class you want to be healthy. So you can and you will get a good grade. Do you want a bad grades? That sums it up on. You got an @CAPS2! On your report card? When you spend alot of your time on a computer then you will get addicted. @CAPS1 you get addicted then you will not do your homework then your grades will drop. You will get bad grades in school. Then you have a possibilty to stay back. Plus then the parents to flipout on. This is one of my reasons why computers effect people in a bad way! When you go on the computer you have @CAPS3 clue who you are talking to unless your thier friends. There has been very many cases that kids getting stolen because of facebook and myspace. @CAPS1 your kid goes on those websites than your kids' always at danger! There are cyber and they could find out where you live that information about you. For instance there was a case on myspace that a kid thought she was talking to a @NUM1 year old boy she was really talking to a @NUM2 something year old guy. Then the girl went missing for about weeks. That was. So you can never trust a computer. When you take a real good look at computers you will see they are just @CAPS3 good. All my reasons before. They are you will not get nearly the amount of you are supose to. Your grade will plummet down @CAPS1 you stay on the computer and they trick you. So even know you can communicate with your friends. Its just not worth it."	4	4		8																					
1420	1	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that there is a massive increase in people using computers in society. @CAPS2 can have its positive effect on people, but too much of @CAPS2 isn't a good thing. This is why I want to tell everyone about negative effects of the computer on people. We all know using computers helps people with all different kinds of things. They can help with business, interacting with family and friends, and you could even just use @CAPS2 for entertainment. Some negative effects that some people don't know, or maybe just ignore, are things like they can keep you from exercising, exploring nature, and you could spend so much time on your computer, that you could get addicted. There should be some way of telling the people that this is happening and is a concern. So I think that we should try to combine what people like to do on computers, with what they should be doing more often, like exercising. Maybe we could tell people that they can use their computers to contact people like friends and family to go out and make plans to exercise and have fun outside so theyre not stuck on the computer all day. We all know that computers can be a good and bad thing. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about places and people in the world, and so much more. They also have bad effects, but that doesn't mean we should take them away from people. And you shouldn't be outside all the time, for the whole day. So I think there should be a limit on how many hours people spend on the computers per day. This way, people get what they want, and they have some time off of @CAPS2, too. Obviously as a result there should be something done about this computer concern. I hope I have persuaded you with my well-thought out thoughts and ideas. And hopefully they will lead you to an idea that will end in a helpful change in society."	4	4		8																					
1425	1	"Dear @CAPS1 post, Computers have been here for a while now and taking them away would be like forgetting all the progress we made in technology. Computers are everywhere in fact, seven out of ten families on my street own atleast one computer in their household. So why would we want to take them away? Computers are too useful. Computers are not only fun, but very resourceful. Anybody with a question faild easily hop on a computer, research it on google.com and find what they were looking for within minutes. I remember when I had a cut on my arm that looked weird, my mom was to heal a wound. She researched it and got how to the mark go away. The computer only benefits you in a way. Is most likely them youll be staying at in two weeks and realize they don't have a pool! Lastey, without computers we would have no communication with new or different people. Computers are great for communicating. People are able to comunicate through twitter, @CAPS2, and even youtube. The sites all help people make new friends online almost like pen pals on the internet. Also, if the majority of your family lived in @LOCATION1 and you were stuck in @CAPS3, you could easily talk to them through email or an instant messanger. Hopefully now you have a better understanding of how much of a lifesaver the computer is. Maybe you could even make next @STATE1 about how resourceful, beneficial and social computers are!"	4	4		8																					
1429	1	"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Three reasons why I think computers have a positive effect on people are that you have the ability to talk to your friends and family, also talk to other people around the world and you can even shop online. Without contact with your loved ones is sad because if you wanna talk to them you can email them to see how they are doing. With emailing you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world. One example of this is if you have a friends in @LOCATION1 and you wanna see if he's doing @CAPS2 you can send him a message. Talking to people on the web is really fun because you can se what or people are playing games with you. If you are on facebook or myspace you can add people as your friends so you can friends. Shopping online is more faster and more quicker than shopping at. is that if you shopping for clothes and there's a then you'll start to go that's why there is online shoping so that we can. You can. In conclusion is a very useful thing. talk to your relatives from @LOCATION2 and you can shopping without the waiting in line. The can talk to other the world."	3	4		7																					
1431	1	"Dear Local newspaper, Technology is a ever evolving thing and more and more people are using it. With more people making use of computers, will be the more technology benefits our society. Through the use of computer people will be taught hand-eye coordination, be presented with the ability to become educated on distant places, and also allow people to talk online with other people. Through the use of computers people will be taught hand-eye coordination. A effective skill to learn would be hand-eye coordination, the benefits of this would be outstanding. Having great coordination would mean that person would exceed past anybody who do not use computers. Advanced coordination would mean that person would able to accomplish more things like fast typing. Finally better hand-eye coordination means that person will be more likely to obtain a job in a field that needs good coordination."	3	3		6																					
1432	1	"The @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 Newspaper just found out that there is a big arguement going on saying that computer are not benefiting society. The other side those who support advances in technology believe that computer have a positive effect on people. Well the @ORGANIZATION1 had to choose a side and the side that they have chosen that computer have a positive affect on people. Yo know why we pick this side because are three reasons why computers are good. Like number one they teach people about far away places and people, @CAPS1 computers are a good sorce of entertainment, and last but not least @CAPS1 computers are good chat room. When @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 are finished telling you why these three reason are good the peoples @CAPS1 computer will win this war! First reason is do you like wasting time walking though the library looking for places or @ORGANIZATION1 people. Well if you have a computer you do not have to deal with these all you have to do is go to sarch and put these person or place name and you will see that in less than a min you have information that will take hours to find in a library. I know this because it happen to me looking for a book that talks about the @CAPS2 caladers. I could not find I had to go on a computer for the information. Secound reason why because computers are a good sorce of entertainment. You know if you got bord and you have computer you can easily just go on it and play so many fun games like @CAPS3 @CAPS4, dragonwars, or any fun game that you can find on a computer. There are so many games to chosse from that you will never get borad. Third reason is the computer is a fun way of talking to friends or family. Like are so many sites that you can chosse to talk to friend or family like @CAPS5, @CAPS6 or even @ORGANIZATION2. Also did you know you can send videos or even pictures of stuff to friends or family. So go on a computers and talk to your friend even that person a picture or something. My cunclision is I hope you take want I said to heart and chosse want the newspaper have as a dision."	4	4		8																					
1437	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to you @DATE1 because of the concern of people that have computers. You are concerned about people whom own computers aren't spending time either excircising, enjoying nature, or not interacting with their family. I agree with the fact that @CAPS5 people have computers they become lazy and don't spend time interacting in any activities. I was in @CAPS1 one day and made a survay, for how many people agree that not many people because of computers aren't interacting in any activities. @PERCENT1 of the people I asked said they agree but of corse the others didn't care much. Many people @MONTH1 think it's normal but I checked a web site that specializes is weight and how to get to your feet and loose weight eazily, that web site is @CAPS3.com. I read an article on the web page and on paragraph @NUM1 sec. @NUM2 it states that the obesity in the @LOCATION1 is caused by either computer and/or lazyness. Of corse some people might disagree but at the same those people who disagree are big time athleats who do both. I had a chate with @PERSON1, a pro @CAPS4 player he said,""@CAPS5 I was a kid we didn't have those things we were either doing home work or playing outside with our friends.

1441	1	"Dear local nepaper, I have reacently heard about the idea of computers are not very productive. Sure, people get informatin and talk online, but that can be a bad thing, I agree with computers being overcused and used for the wrong reason. To me, the main source of communication is chatting online. Even I talk online all the time. Chatting online is also a terrible thing if you abuse @CAPS1. Children aroung the world talk to people they hace never seen. People are being abroad because they believe the person they are taking to is the real deal, @CAPS1 is a great way to communicate just not in the wrong ways. Plagourism is happening all over the world, People just take whatever they want, when they did not create @CAPS1. We take if you are caught doing @CAPS1, you can go to prison. Although there is a way we van help the plagorism. the internet has all the information in the world, and people abuse @CAPS1. I have seen papers that have information that they copred and passed @CAPS1 to their paper. You can tell because @CAPS1 is a different for than the others, and bad things happen. Teachers immediately you have to talk to a supervisor about @CAPS1. I know I will try my best to not playorise, I can start by getting my own information. Everyone loves computer and technology, but if everyone can just lay off the computer for a while, things like plagorism and the abuse or online chatting can be limited. "	4	4		8																					
1444	1	"A large amount of people use computers daily, but not everyone agrees this technology benefits society. I think that computers benefit our way of life in many ways. This very useful technology has a positive effect on people because, it allows people to send, receive, and research a vast variety of information easily. @PERCENT1 of people use the computer to get information and get it more quickly than reading a book about that specific topic. They say that this powerful technology has been more effective and quicker. My cousin and I were both given the same research paper to do. He used several books to get information on the topic and I used the computer. The project took me @NUM1 days to do, while it took him a whole week to complete. @PERSON1, computer programming expert, said, ""Computers have made receiving information so much faster. I vehemently believe that everyone should own this device. Moreover, computers help with communication. There are many ways to keep in touch with people over the world, like email, chat rooms, and websites like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. These websites are a great tool to keep in touch with family and friends or even fans. @PERSON2, lead singer of the band @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, said ""@CAPS1 is a way to talk to the fans directly ad post updates about upcoming tours and albums. Not only isit great for bands but it is great for college students. My older brother is a college student and we communicate through these websites so it seems like he is never that far away. The computer can also help with business. Meeting can be done through @ORGANIZATION2 or a different webchat service. Emails are a great way to send information. @NUM2 of business meetings are held over the internet has benefited work ethics. Please heed my advice and use the internet and computer. It will benefit your way of communication and your way of getting information."	5	5		10																					
1446	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 people think that computers educate people for the future but I think that they actually harm children and adults as well. First of all, kids are so wraped up in computer games that they never go out and exercise. Second, if you ask a child anything about nature they will probably not know what to say, but they would if they spent less time on the computer. Finally, many families today never see each other because kids and their parents are too busy on the computer. These three reasons show why computers don't benefit society. Obesity is a huge problem among the children in @LOCATION1. The reason for this is that they are spending too much time online and not outdoors and exercising. Kids are not getting any fresh air or exercise and this can lead to serious health conditions. Parents sometimes don't do anything about it because they they have the same problem. This just shows that computers and other technology are effecting families around the country by making them overweight and. @CAPS1 children don't know the first thing about nature and. People say that computers educate people about things but nature and the environments is a big of our lives. The best learn about it and help. Computers the time they are, the earth might become even worse so they need to get educated on nature and the environment so they can. I know from my own experience that computers take away time from your friends and family. Instead of playing games on the computer at home, you could be spending time with your family in the park or the pool. My dad always spend his time on the computer and we never had time to spend with him. When he realized this he rearanged his schedual so we could have more time together. It is very important to spend time with your family because they are such a big part of your life and less of computer will help families do that. As you can see, getting off the computer will help kids stay in shape and healthy, educate them on the enviornment, and help families interact with each other more. If getting off the computer changed my families lifestyle then it will do the same to others as well. Hopefully you agree with me because it will surely tak a positive affect.

1456	1	"How would you like to got a ""@CAPS1"" on your social studies report? What if you couldn't see your school friends at all after-school? What if you were bored to death, and you couldn't watch t.v. or play games? Some experts are about people because they think they are spending too much time using their computers and not enough time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. On your computer: you can watch videos and play games, you can chat and talk to people, and you can even boost up your grade. I honestly think that the thought of people being on their computers too much is a silly thought @CAPS2, let's look at how a computer can change your life. Lets say you have a history report the tomorrow, you forgot your history book at school, and you know nothing about the report. You are going to fail if you don't hand it in, so why not turn on your computer and open up the internet browser. I remember @TIME1 year I was doing a report about the @CAPS4 @CAPS3. I literally knew nothing about them and I failed to bring home my book. I opened up the internet and typed in @CAPS4 @CAPS3 in @ORGANIZATION1 and @DATE1 I found out that I got a @NUM1 on the report. You can also use the computer just to look up information for for about something that you might learn in school. ""@TIME1 @DATE1, I was reading about the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and a few days @DATE1 we talked about how that @CAPS7 posibly could have been made. I was the only student in our grade that knew that answer. You can use the computer for playing games that are related to school. For example, how fast can you complete all of these multiplication problems or division problems. Look at what computers can do. If you got bad grades (without computer), you will go to a bad college and have a bad job, however, if you got good grades(with computer), you will go to a good college and get a good job. Next, let's look at how you can chat or talk to people. You can have a mesaging connection with someone by using @CAPS8 or a free to free conversation using @ORGANIZATION2 on your computer. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people with computers have either @CAPS8 or @ORGANIZATION2 installed in their computers. You can also communicate with people who has an email address. I remember having a problem with my laptop and my crush knows everything about them. So I emailed him and how I get a response and I fixed my laptop. You are able to interact with people by meeting them online and then them on public. Everyone know about those dating websites that matches two people and them together. A computer can really the of your life. Lastly, let's look at what you can do in the computer when you are bored. Why you go youtube and watch videos that look appropriate and interesting? ""@CAPS10, I was done with homework and I didnt know what to do, so i online and spend only watching youtube videos, sometimes people like playing games. Just @TIME1, I was playing tetris, but only for @NUM2 minutes because I needed a goodnight's before the @CAPS11. You can also listen to the radio on a website. Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of people that listened to the radio @CAPS10 were in cars. But @PERCENT3 is also @PERCENT4 more listening to the radio online. Not only can a computer increase your grades and improve your life, can entertain you as well. As you can see, saving the of computers is is a silly idea and is absolutely non-sense. Computers can and make you. I honestly never seen someone on the computer for."	5	5		10																					
1480	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time."	5	4		9																					
1488	1	"I think that computers are very valueable and help a lot of people I think that computers should be used for information that could help students with their homework or to study for a test and also for adults to look up things such as directions, adresses, and prices of clothes and other items. They are also good because they help you communicate with friends and help people make plans to do with friends. However some people should limit themselves on things like facebook and twitter, some people spend too much time on those things and should limit themselves to just @NUM1 minutes a day on those sites. One of the reasons I think computers are good is because some students might not now the answer to something on their homework and could use the computer to find out the answers. Another reason why computer can be very valueable to all students is because lets say a student has a quiz on mitusis and cells in science the next day and doesnt really understand it they could use the computer to learn about it and do good on their quiz. Another reason that computer are good for people is because it helps them communicate with theri friends. Some kids are only and arent that gool at interacting with people in person. But these social networking sites help them come out of their shells and make them a little less shy and make more friends. however like I said earlier some poepleget carried away and spend too much time doing this kind of stoffs and should limit themselves to just @NUM1 minutes per day on these social networking sites. Some people use their computers for other important things like buying things and getting directions and adresses. If somebody want to go to a store in a different town but didnt know where it was they could up the address an dthen find the directions to that place some people also use the computer to purchase things like groceriess and clothes. Sometimes people save money because they buy something online a sale than going to a store and paying anymore money. As you can see the computer has a lot of positives. Therefore I encourage you to support computers, because they are so useful and valuable."	4	4		8																					
1499	1	"Dear @PERSON2, @CAPS1 your latest article on the goods and bads of computers in our society was informative, I believe you left out a few major reasons why technology is doing more harm than good. If people don't become aware of the consiquences, who knows where our world is heading? First off, I'd like to mention the health issues associated with technology in general, but especally computers. Dr. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION2 states that ""@CAPS2 since the popularity of the internet boomed with the invention of websites like '@CAPS3' and '@CAPS4', we've seen a drastic spike in obesity-related heart disease and diabetes."" And @PERSON3 isn't exaggerating. Because of the sudden boom in electronics, more and more people prefer sitting on the couch with their brand new laptop or @CAPS5 then go for a bikeride or play a game of fastball with friends. Because of this, more and more people become victims of heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and bone elipses that could leave them paralized for the rest of their life. Is playing that online game so important, to you that its worth your life? Next, I'd like to touch on the fact that @CAPS1 the internet @MONTH1 seem like a great place to do some socializing, it can actually aid in losing friends insted of making them. I know what your thinking, @PERSON2, 'But sites like '@CAPS6' help people connect, why would they lose friends?' @CAPS7, really. Since its so easy to type in a conversation, people are losing actual social skills. They also spend too much time talking to friends without meeting face-to-face, and that eventually causes them to drift apart. And when talking to someone over a screen, its so hard to know if your actually close friends. Because of this, they cant bond and they wont have a real friendship. @PERSON4, a @NUM1 year old at @ORGANIZATION1, says that him and his best friend now only talk over @CAPS3, and they dont even feel like true friends anymore. So finally, I have a request. Next time you turn on that laptop, think. Is this really worth losing your friends and even your health @CAPS2? Next time feel the urge to update your status with something like '@CAPS8 got home,' @CAPS8 call a friend over to go hang out at the park instead. Trust me, you'll be glad you did. Thank you for the time to read my letter."	5	5		10																					
1503	1	"Dear newspaper editor, I think we should have internet, or computers at our houses. We should have it because we can chat with our friends and family, noone would get bored doing nothing and we learn new things from different websites. We should be able to communicate to our friends and family @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in our school think having a computer is good. For example my friend moved to @LOCATION1, we couldn't talk on the phone. It was long distance I talk to her over facebook. There are a lot of websites you can talk on like facebook, twitter or even myspace you can even skype. skype is when you have a webcam and you talk threw it. My mom said that most of her friends chat online with her. It doesn't matter how old are you. Anyone can learn important things. There are a lot of websites that are educational @PERCENT1 things on the computer are worth having. If you are old and you can't go to school just go to google and type any math term, science, @CAPS1, or even learning a new language. Everytime I have to do my social studies homework I go online trust me it's really helpful. Some things on the computer are very fun. You won't get bored on the type of games they have. A lot of parents complain that their children are doing bad things in the streets. The do there kind of things, because are bored @NUM3 people think that statement is true. If they had a computer, and playing games, or talking to friends, they would be like they are. @STATE1 and @PERSON1 are two state that have more people that go on the computer than any others states. Remember it's not only fun. Everyone enjoys having a computer. I think we should have internet access because we can do a lot of things some people think it's bad, but not everything is. We should have a computer, because, we can chat with friends, we can learn important and interestings things and we won't get bored. I hope you made up your mind and decided that all internet access is not a waste of time. I'm not the only one that thinks that "" a computer is what keeps or alive""."	4	5		9																					
1512	1	"Dear Local @CAPS1, I have been infromed that people don't get to talk to friends/family, enjoy nature and exercise because of computers. Well computers benefit our life. The first thing about/ computers is communication. People can use @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and etc. The social networking groups are for abilities to talk to friends, long distance or close and family enjoy research. Just because @CAPS11 use those internet websites doesn't mean @CAPS11 can't go outside and enjoy activities. This leads to other objects called peortables. As technology advances so does our skills. Every year more electronics are made and most likely are portable such as @CAPS5, @CAPS6 phones, @CAPS7, and etc. Many of these companies let us take these devices to allow as to do everyday things. With @ORGANIZATION1 creater of the @CAPS8 @CAPS11 can use this internet/music @CAPS9 for everything. for example, I visit my grandparents and I decied to my @CAPS6 phone. I can talk to friends on my @CAPS6 phone by texting and visit my grandparents. More of this opplies to and @CAPS5 @CAPS11 still all go outside and enjoy life. exercise is something @CAPS11 should yet to. If you stay cramed in your house @CAPS12 fun. @CAPS11 need to cheer up and go outside and play sports. @CAPS11 could get included in and join activity. @CAPS11 also can have videos online to show us how to exercise or use yoga. Most of use portables which goes back to my last paragraph. Exercise is big and @CAPS11 all should do it. What I'm trying to say here @CAPS11 can use computers and electronics and exercise with fun one in all. If you understand experts can agree and kids could be healthier and still communicate."	4	4		8																					
1518	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers are a helpful advantage in the @CAPS4's life. It offers and contributes many ideas and actions. Computers help people find a nice spot to travel. Also it helps people meet or make @CAPS1 friends. A computer is another way for people to get thier hand-eye cordination better. Computers are very helpfull in a humans life. Computers are usefull when trying to explore @CAPS1 places. One can book a flight anywhere in a matter of minits on a computer. How else would it be possible to travel somplace far away without booking a flight on a computer. Next, computers help learn about different coltures. Once one has booked reservations to a certain travel spot on thier computer, they will learn much about the unfamiliar land they have went to. My family has gone to many different areas around the world. The trips would not have been possible without help researching and making flights with the computers. The computer makes it possible to experience to territorys. It is a key item when someone is looking to travel. A computer is emensly important when trying to communicate with friends. People can meet and make friends very simply using websites such as facebook on the computer. Facebook creats friendship very easily. I recently waited to get to know a students better. I looked him up on facebook and now we are aqetances. Next, programs on the computers such as A.I.M. help people communicate about anything such as homework to other personal topics. Lastly, if one wants to get to know another better he or she can look at thier blog. They @MONTH1 start to talk and become good friends. Computers are usfull when trying to comunicate or find friends. Computers not only help with travel and friends but it also helps with ones hand eye cordination. Typing letters while looking at a screen is using the hand eye coordination. This action can help with sports. For example in baseball one must have a good hand eye cordination to help catch and hit the ball. Secondly, with hand eye cordination getting better with the computer. it helps kids fit in. If one has good hand eye cordination they can play sports are make friends. If one becomes good with hand eye cordination and typeing they will be able to get a job writing for a newspaper or a book. Hand eye cordination and typing with computers can lead to a succesfull life. Computers in an @CAPS5 life can help in the long run. It will help with travel plans, friends, and hand eye cordination."	5	5		10																					
1523	1	"@CAPS1 you know we all like computers and we all use it for all different tyoes off things like to chat or to do work and most importantly to fine something but computers are in a way not that good for you especially if your computer is your life, one reason I think computers are in a way bad is because when you are on it for when you are on it for along time you get hungry then you get some snaks and by the time your done using the computer gained. A pound no imagin how much wiget you will gain if you do that every day alot! My next reason why I think computers are in a way bad is because when you are the computer too long your eyes start to hurt and your hands start to cramp and everything starts to hurt to much typing and looking at the same thing for along to can make you have eye problems and can also give you something in your hands and then you will not to be able to do anything with your hands for along time because it will start hurting. My last reason why i think computers in a way are bad because it can mess your computers up it can over heat or just down because you have ben on it for too long. It can also get a virese then you will just have to get a whole new computer @CAPS1 you can see there are plenty of reasons why I think computers are kinda bad"	4	4		8																					
1525	1	"Dear local Newspaper, I was reading this article about computers. I agree with kids and adults not having time enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. But, also, kids and adults should be having some fun time outside and enjoying it. But when it comes to usage of computers is helpful for searching information. I think kids and adults need to get active and get healthy, because now kids don't want to play outside, so they can play outside, so they can play video games. When I was a little kid I would always play hide and seek but now my mother doesnt like to play anymore because of technology she rather be on the computer or on the phone. Kids all over the world now know how to use computers because they don't want to be outside. Computers are only helful when your doing a report or something, important. For example, people that have businesses they are going to need computers. Also when a teacher a sighs a project on someone your going to need a computer to search up information for that person. Finally alot of kids aren't taking responsibilty of school. They don't that school serious. Kids think that the computers will teach you everything well there wrong because things on the computer can be made up. But its also making there life very in healthy. So thats why computers are good usage and bad at time because kids don't play outside anymore and computer are helpfull for searching information so with. What I've sadi don't you agree with me?"	4	4		8																					
1533	1	"Dear local Newspaper, Have you ever wondered why people spend so much time on the computer. The effect of people a computer is good and had because the good parts you can communicate with people in far away places, like you can talk to someone you went to @LOCATION1 with in @LOCATION1 and / or @CAPS1 @LOCATION1 with. The bad part is that if your on the computer all the time then you are neglecting time with family and friends. When you are spending all of you time on the computer you are becoming a couch potatoe and its very unhealty of also a good reason is a family member moved and you had to communicate by webcam so if you like live in @LOCATION2 and you have all you family here in @STATE1 other by sending letter and by sending pictures but they cant see how you act and by phone you can only hear voices you can see anything. A lot people disagree because alot people think computers are a big waste so thats all i have to say on the subject."	3	3		6																					
1556	1	"Dear @CAPS1, Computers play a huge role in society. Many adults and children spend a lot of time on a computer every day and I think that is bad. Instead of being on computers, I think it would be best to spend time with your family. Exercising and enjoying the outdoors is also a good time consuming activity to do. Studying, school work, and jobs are also important things people should be doing instead of being on the computer so much. Family is very important in life and some people take advantage of it. Instead of being on the computer all day, spending home with family and doing activities with them could be more fun. For example, most teenagers come home from school and go on this computer to talk to friends or play games instead of talking with this parents about this day or anything. By spending time with family you not only learn more about them but you can become closer and be able to talk with them about anything. Nature is a beautiful thing. Sure you can see pictures of nature on the internet, but! is is not the same as the actual thing. By outside, and enjoying nature, taking walks, runs, or even hikes, you can get your exercise. Exercising is a very important thing in a persons life, because you need to be fit to be healthy, and by being on a computer all the would happen. Adults, and even some teenagers have jobs in. While some jobs involve computers, most do not. No one can get in job by spending all day on the computer playing games. I talking to people. Teenagers well and do while playing game talking to. Computer are all the time. There are plenty of important activities, such as, spending time with family, enjoying nature, and school work and jobs. Computer are not necisity. We lives, so I think use should using them"	4	4		8																					
1559	1	"Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1 I'm @PERSON1, @CAPS2 going to tell you some positeves & negatives: The truth about computers. First @CAPS2 going to tell you some positives about computers. The internet is a virtual at your finger tips, it provides the smartest questions to the most questiners. In the internet every thing is more easy, I mean all you have to do to learn how it works is to use a keyboard & mouse. Computers have changed over the years, from to have . Yes computers have there are popular chatting websites @CAPS3, facebook, twitter, flickr. It seems cool yes but the internet has a very darkside too! Second, here are some dark secret of the computer. So far in the news there have been reports of suicide of the teenager life, reports like: girls killing themselves because lack of . Boys killing themselves because . Yes we do live in a world where everyone is judged by how they . Well there you have it computers are good & bad we just have to be ."	4	3		7																					
1561	1	"Dear Local @CAPS1, @CAPS2 do you feel about computers? Are they good or are they bad? I strongly believe that computers are bad and people spend to much time on them. I'd much rather spend time outside where I can excercise; @CAPS3't you? Computers are a waste of time and they keep family and friends from spending time together. Finally, computers can be very dangerous. People could be lying and you @CAPS3't know it. To start off, computers take away from excercising and spending time outside. I know if I had to choose between looking at a boring computer screen all day and going out for a run; I'd choose the run anyday. Computers don't keep people fit and healthy so they should find something else to do instead. I've observed that the average teen spends @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours a day on the computer. That's @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours they could be excercising or playing outside. For example, walking the dog, or kicking the soccer ball around. You see, there are many things you can do other than going on the computer. Further more, computers cut into quality time with friends and family. I know you can video chat and instent message them, but @CAPS3't you rather spend time with them in person? Too many kids are on the computer so much they don't know what's going on in their mom or dads lives. Theres is a lot of things kids can do with their friends and families instead of using the computer. They could play a board game, watch a movie, and much more. I garentee they will enjoy these activities more then staring at a computer screen for @NUM5 hours. Finally, computers are extremly dangerous. People have been killed because they don't know who they are talking to. Kids go on myspace and put up pictures and posts, but they don't realize that everyone can see what they said. Once they put something out there they cannot take it away. It's also dangerous because it someone is applying to a school that school can see what they put up and can decline the person from college. I hope you agree with me when I say computers are bad. They keep people from excercising, spending time with friends/family, and are very dangerous. In my opinion we should get rid of computers in every house."	4	5		9																					
1569	1	The effect's computers have on people is not resinable for children and other people. Computers are not good for people these day's because people are spleeling all there time' on the computer and are'nt realling that it miss up there eye's and some people are adicted to it. Now people are useing the computer like they are nutting. So people think that the computers aren't hurtful to there eye's the time people are speeling on the computer they can be speeling time with there family and friend. People helpful is on the line with this computer thing. People shouldn't be useing computers like they are because all day on the computer can mess up your eyes and that's what people are not understand there day. I think that it should be a limeit for when people go on the computers.	3	2		5																					
1573	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 are you? As for me I am fine. I am writing this letter to explain to you why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons why I am writing this letter is that people could contack with friends and families from far-away places, computers helps you leran more about different parts of the world and also computers helps people understand and learn more about life. That's why I believe you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people. First of all why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that people could contack with friends and families from far-away places. An example to support my reason is that people from all parts of the world have families different places. And they cannot have a good contack with them. But if they go on the internet they could their friends and families and chat with them. This shows that if you live in the @LOCATION2 and you have a friends that live in @LOCATION1 you could have a with I have families that lives and @LOCATION1 and it is hard to them. But when I am on the computer I can chat with them and have a fun time. This shows that you need a computer to catch up with friends and family. That's why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Second of all why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that computers helps you learn more about different parts of the world. An example is that if you don't know anything about a country or a place you could go on the internet a research and learn more about that place. This shows that computers is important to have. Another example is that when I have a project or a essay and I don't know about it. I could go on the computer and look it up. And by doing this it will help me on my project or essay. That's why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Finally why I believe so is that computers helps you understand and learn more about life. An example is that if you don't know if something is right or wrong you could look it up and it @MONTH1 help you. This shows that computers can give advices. Another example is that computers could give you an idea on what to do. If you are trying a new resipie and you are not sure on @CAPS3 to make it. And it will give you the inderigant and direction to make that food or snack you want. That's why I believe that you and all others should believe that computers have a positive effects. In conclusion why you should believe that computers have a positive effect is that people could contack with friends and families, computers helps you learn about different parts of the world, and also computers helps you learn and understand more about life. I would hope you read and reread this letter and consider about believing that computers have a positive effect on people. That's why you should believe that computers have positive effect on people.

1575	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to you to talk about the effect computers have on people. Since I have two computers and one laptop I have to agree that every person who likes to look up stuff should have a computer. Everyone should have computers, because you can look up different things, you can play games like checkers with the computer or against somebody else, and the last reason @CAPS1 that you can chat with people from different states and even countries, because I know everybody likes to talk to one another. Everyone should have computers, because you can search different things. You can search places and people. Basically, you can search anything on the internet @CAPS3 you are on the right website. One time I wanted to go on the web and look to see @CAPS3 there was a in @LOCATION1. I went to ask.com and typed in ""@CAPS1 there a in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1? It said yes, and then it showed me a @CAPS2 of information about. It told me the address the phone number and the name of the manager. Looking up places in sometimes. Everyone should have a because you can play any types of game. You could play internet game checkers, solitaire and even freecall. @CAPS3 you don't any types of games you can always go on gaming just games up there. Since I use the computer everyday onto all. When I was six years old we a driving game. Since I did not the website all I got to play was checkers on the computers but one day logged onto it and played my first driving computer game. Everyone should have a computer, because you can chat with people. Instead of always using your phone calling and texting people raising your phone bill, why not use your computer and chat all you want without wasting minutes on your cell phone. I know everybody likes to talk and text on your cell phone. Instead of doing that just go on the internet find a chatcom and start chatting or bloging with your friends. One time I ran out of minutes on my phone and I didn't have internet. I asked my dad @CAPS3 I could use the computer. He said yeah, so I went to a local chatroom on the internet. My friend had an acount there so it would be easy for us to talk all we wanted. I joined in and we chatted until @TIME1. In conclusion I think everyone that likes to look up places, play games, and chat should have a computer."	4	5		9																					
1576	1	"Computers are intresting peices of technology to work with at home or at work. Some people might think that computers are a waste of time. Also might not be useful. Or that the computers don’t have anyway of helping you. Other people think that the computer is very helpful. People should be happy about the computer invention. What do you think about it? Your wasting your time on the computers! Thats what you hear your parents say all the time right. Well, kids dont really wastes their time if they are on the compter because they could be writing up a paper for a class. They might be playing on educational game on the computers. Even if they arent playing a game or writing up a paper. It is still making them learn some thing. Some people might say that computers are useless, but that is not true. When you are writing a paper for an @CAPS1 class. You would want a computer to help. It has a keyborad so it gose faster when you type. Instead of writing the word out. It also has a grammer check. That is to help you spell the words out correctly. This is why a computer is a useful thing to use. Computers dont make things go faster. But yet they do. They help you find information about many things on the internet. Also if you had to look up a person for a school project. I think you would find more things about that person that you would in books. It really close make things go faster. Computers do help you. There not a waste of time. They are useful to every one. They also help things go faster."	4	4		8

1581	1	"Some experts are concerned that people are spending to much time on computers, and I believe that they are correct. Most kinds would perfer to be on the computer chatting with friends on line or spending hours on facebook but what is the point of this when there is a whole to explore, they don't enjoy natire like they should, and they spend less time with family and friends. If you are on the computer twenty four hours a day, seven days a week how are you supposed to get enough exersize? Well that's the problem you don't get any exersize. Some might disagree with me but the truth is, moving your hand over the mouse doesn't count! A recent survay has been conduched and @CAPS2 said that out of the @PERCENT1 of kids who own a computer @PERCENT2 are over-weight or indanger of being over-weight. @CAPS2 is sad to think that technology has taken over so much that @CAPS2 is ruining poeples lives. I go in the computer @CAPS1 too, but I am always sure to ride my bike after or go for a hike with my family @CAPS1 of the times I have softball practice so I'm not able to go on the computer anyway. Now what about the beautiful things in nature @CAPS1 of us are missing? The outdoors is one thing most of us take advantage on, some of us have @CAPS3 seen a day-lily are at night and new ones grow the very next day. This a facinating are might @CAPS3 see because they have a computer screen in front of their face. Kids really should learn to balance tecknology and the more important things in life like protecting nature and exercising. Yes, I know, that some will disagree by saying, ""but i am saying the rain forest, or the @LOCATION1, by being a member of this website."" @CAPS2's true you are helping but doing @CAPS2 yourself would feel a whole lot better. For example you could get a group and clean up the streets in your neighborhood or help plant trees in the park. The most important thing in life is family and friends, technology should @CAPS3 get in the way of that. If you loose everything what is the one thing your will always have? Loving family and friends of course! If family is so importand then why would kid want to be on the computer than at a family picnic? Is is because technology is taking over their life and clouding their vision of the more important things life has to offer. Don't you sometimes wish you were a little kid again running bare footed a field with your parents? That could be some what have if you got off the chair you have been sitting in for three hours straight and took a hike with your family. I might not be making much sense but being with family in person is better than instant messaging someone you just meet who lives half way across the world! I know that a ton of people are going to disagree with me when they read this but, I think technology is ruining some peoples lives. If you think about @CAPS2 a computer is like a @CAPS4-@CAPS5 @CAPS6 , @CAPS2 has a sugar sweet coating byt when you get the full force of @CAPS2, @CAPS2 traps you in and won't let go. A computer is ruining lives and experts have a right to be worried about people's health! All of us should get more exersize, spend more time in Nature, and be with family and friends more often than sitting on a chair glued to a computer screen."	5	6		11																					
1583	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think it's a good thing that people spend so much time on computers. One reason for this is when you type you learn hand-eye corrdination. Another reason computer time is a good time could be is it saves money on other things. The last reason is because you can do things in seconds on a computer that would normaly take hours. Hand-eye coordination is an importand thing: for example you're walking down the street when a baseball flys at you, your able to cach it because of all the time you have bin on the computer has taught you hand-eye coordination. Their are lots of ways to get it, like playing sports, writting, or just playing with your thumbs but learning to type is by far the best way because you'll use the skill while you'r a kids and an adult, @CAPS3 trouble paying your phone bill? Guss what you don't need a phone, why not use your computer to call people sensa its free. Also you wont really need a cell phone because you can do everything that can do quicker on a computer anwway. Last of all its harder for poeple to steel or you to lose a computer as to a cell phone. Have you ever got upset when treing to look for a peice of in formation in a book? Well you can be done with the hours of looking if you just use a computer, then you can get outside, and play games. Most of the time it takes me hours to do my homework, but is I had a computer it probly only take me minutes to do it. So for hand-eye coordination, having trouble with bills and it takeing to long to look thing up by other means I think its good that people spent and i hope you agree."	4	4		8																					
1586	1	"Dear, Newspaper People should use less time on the computer because it effects their lifestyle. Instead of using their computer all the time they shoul exercise hang out with their friends and family and just enjoy nature. First of all computer's can bring a lot of obesity to the @LOCATION1 because it bring lazyness and it makes peole not went to exercise. If people start to exercise at least around @PERCENT1 of lazyness will go down. They should at least go out for a walk instead of using all their electrity. Also around @PERCENT2 of your electrity bill will go down if you go exercise instead of using computer. Secondly people need to start enjoying nature insteed of being on the computer at the time. People should go green and start recyling and not worrying about what somebody said on ""myspace"" or ""facebook"". Also if we started recyling and worring about nature @PERCENT3 of the earth would be greener. My last reson being their should be more friendler family time enstead of computer time. Computers just make you break away from your family and friends because your worrying whats happening on the internet. @PERCENT4 of people should just get of the computer all the time and just chill with your family and friends. In my conclusion these are my reasons being for people so they wont use the computer so much and so they can just kick back chill with your friend and family, exercise and enjoy natur"	4	3		7																					
1588	1	"Dear @CAPS1 of The Local Newspaper: @CAPS2 students are promoted to higher grade levels, more teachers will require research papers. In my opinion @CAPS10 a computer helps me complete my research paper and the contents in it are the best it can be. What makes students and parents more happy to see @CAPS3's on their child's paper? Advances in technology. there should be advances in technology because they teach hand-eye coordination, it gives the ability to learn about far away places, and people, and even allows people to talk online with other people. To begin there should be advances in technology beacause it teaches hand-eye coordination. In a recent poll seen in TIME magazine, it showed that @PERCENT1 of people who use computers had a large increase in their coordination, people were not @CAPS2 clumsy and poorly coordinated. @PERSON1, a professional tennis player @CAPS4 that, ""@CAPS5 I started using a computer, I always, would play tennis for living and it was a bad choice because I was poorly coordinated. I always missed the tennis ball in matches. So I decided to stop. Then I started to use the computer more and my coordination improved. Now I barely miss any tennis balls."" @CAPS6, @CAPS10 advances in technology will improve and teach hand-eye coordination. Another reason there should be advances in technology is because it gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people. @PERSON2 @CAPS7 a writer from @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 that, ""People like to research a place @CAPS5 they go on vacation or a buisness trip because they would like to know more about it."" Not knowing anything about your vacation destination is like not knowing what's for dinner tonight, it is clearly unreasonable. Recent studies show that the more a person knows about their vacation destination the more enjoyable it is. Thus, the more vacations they go one which is profitable for airplane companies. Also knowing about the different cultures of the people in far away places gives people a better perspective of the world they live in. Thus, @CAPS10 advances in technology will give the ability to learn about far away places and people. Furthermore, @CAPS10 advances in technology will allow people to talk online with other people. @PERSON3 @CAPS8 the creator of @CAPS9 @CAPS4 that, ""@CAPS10 online chat programs will help people communicate with each other. @CAPS9 has been beneficial to everybody. For example, it helps people re-connect with their former friends. It is also very beneficial to students because if they forget a homework assignment they can log onto @CAPS9 and ask a classmate."" A recent article found on @ORGANIZATION2, showed that online chat programs helped people communicate with each other. @CAPS6, @CAPS10 advances in technology will allow people to talk online with other people. In conclusion, @CAPS10 advances in technology will improve hand-eye coordination, teach people about far away places and people, and allows people to talk online with other people. When voting on this decision please take part and support advances in technology, it will be beneficial to everybody. Thank you for your time."	5	5		10																					
1589	1	"Dear editors of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 morning, my sister wakes me up to go to school. She uses her cell phone to set an alarm. A few years ago, my mom would come in and tell us it was time to get up. Now, we have one small device that we carry around with us to do our work. Most everyone has cellphone now, and it does much more than allow people to talk to one another from two different places. Now we can play games, go on the. These advances in the technology are making us very selfish. I, for one, do not approve. For starters, all of these new and improved gadgets are time consuming. With all the things to do in the world, we could all be doing something helpful, fun, or productive. Don't you agree? I mean, if you consider the idea that we all could be hitting the gym or studying for school tests and quizzes, then most teenagers would be in much better shape, physicly, and mentaly, @CAPS2. @PERSON1, my aunt an former physisist, said. The rate at which most students and kids grow increasingly more obese, @CAPS3 because of these new ideas involving phones and i-pods are completely sickening. The more time we spend using these items, the more we oppose the idea of being active? You can clearly see how we are growing less energetic, and much more careless of our time. Furthermore, the advances in today's society are pushing on the boundries at internet safety. Sure, people might claim that they can block out other people, but sometimes when someone posts something on the web, they don't always hide it well enough. They could have blackmailed one of your friend into commiting a crime, right? That happened to one of my cousins, @CAPS3 last year. The police took a long time to find her after she had been kidnapped, because the person who kidnapped her hid the evidence by a chain of blackmails. Do you see how important it is to spend less time on these silly computers? It sucks us into a virtual world that is sometimes 'bloody' or 'war-like? My brother learned swearing from the new & advanced game of @CAPS5. It's a fighting game (@CAPS6!) I implore your company to make the righty decision and write to help pull us off of our butts and get us up and going strong again. I hope you take my advice, and i thank you for your extremely valuable time and effort."	5	5		10																					
1598	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, I think the effects that computers have on people are bad, and should be stopped. I mean don't get me wrong computers help people, but a lot of people go on it everyday, some computers can get viruses, and there are much more activities to do other than on a computer. I hope to persuade you about the horrible effects a computer has on people. Do you know how many people use the computer? Well, according to @ORGANIZATION1 over @NUM1 billion people use a computer worldwide. The problem we are facing today is that too many people are on a computer, most of them are teens. According to @PERSON1 about @PERCENT1 of teens spend most of their time on an computer. Facebook, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 are the most common places to find teens. I would know that because I have a facebook myself. I've had one for almost a year, and you should see all the people who have one. My friend wanted me to get one because she said she had one one wanted me to get one too. So I did and then I found out that more then half of my grade had a facebook. In my own words I honestly think the computer can be addicting, especially when your on a worldwide account like facebook. There are many people on the computer and if must be stopped. In addition, another reason is computers occasionally get viruses. According to @CAPS3.com, the average adult gets about @NUM2 to @NUM3 viruses a year. My friend @PERSON2 was on his computer typing a report, and then his computer shut down. Then @NUM4 seconds @CAPS4 the computer said you have a virus. The next day @PERSON2 told me he didn't have his report because the virus wiped out all his information. About @PERCENT2 of viruses can cause a computer to shut down and it is hard to reboot it. Some places have made virus scans such as mcafee. and @CAPS5, but sometimes they can't catch the virus. @PERCENT3 of people who say that a virus was cought by the virus scan they have, their computer freezes up and you can't delete the virus, viruses must be terminated, so the computer can work properly. Thats another reason to why computers affect people in a bad way. Furthermore, people think that the computer is their everything. They're wrong! There is a lot of activities that they can do other than be on a computer. According to @CAPS6. Burn the average person between the ages of @NUM5 and @NUM6 spend more then @NUM7 hours on a computer. There are many other options of activities like call your friends and get together, that's why they invented the cell phone, play a sport, read a book, spend time with family for @PERSON3's @CAPS7! Don't spend all your time on the computer. About @PERCENT4 of teens who are on the computer alot tend to get into lower colleges later in life. That is my final reason of the bad effects a computer has. In conclusion, computers can cause a bad influence due to viruses, too much time on it, and not doing other things. I hope you can see my point to this and please send me a response as soon as possible."	5	5		10

1613	1	"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a positive affect on society because it gives a lot of information, it has lots of fun games and music, and it informs you about issues in the world and communities. The first reason I think that computers have a positive affect on society is because its gives you lots of information. If you need to do projects and research, what better way to do them than on a computer. You can search all kinds of people like the presidents of the @LOCATION1, celebrities, and people that made a change in the world. You can also look @CAPS5 and study different kinds of plants and animals, and you can find fasmating experiments to do. The second reason I think that computers have a positive affect on society is because it has lots of fun games and music. You can go on the @CAPS1 channel website and play lots of diffrent games from your favorite t.v shows. They also have learning games on test prep fun where you can play games to help you do well on your @ORGANIZATION2 such as comprehension clinic. The computer also has lots of music that you can listen to. You can listen to @ORGANIZATION1's album. I am @PERSON1 before You @CAPS2 it, or @PERSON2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 before buying the @NUM1 songs.

You can go on a computer and search @CAPS5 natrual disasters like @CAPS8 earthquake, @CAPS9 earthquake, or information about the tsunami that @MONTH1 hit @LOCATION2. You can search @CAPS5 @CAPS10 @PERSON3 and get information. You can search your favorite artist and see what their albums gonna be like or you can search @CAPS5 issues in your community.

1614	1	"Dear @CAPS1 I think that computers are beneficial to our society for example, computers are very helpful to everybody. Computers alsi travel nows faster. And they can teach us new things. I am not saying computers don’t have their downs, but, computers also have their ups. Computers are very helpful in many ways. They help people find lost fmaily members, and they help police officers find many criminals. Haven't you lost soemone in your family, or haven't spoken to them in years and always wanted to find them and get back in with them? Well that's what computer are for. Aslo haven't you been concern about the many criminals on the street, and wanted to get them of the streets and in jail where they belong but didnt have a way to do that? Computers  help. Haven't you notice that computers are  help police many women in the present time? Computers  people in the , but they help travel fastre for example say you heard there was hurricane or tornado and you needed to find out how . All you have to do is on the computer and look it up. Also, there an earthquake in @LOCATION1 and the didn't information to help you. You would just go on the computer and find all the information you need. COmputers are of many things for they you. Computers teach you alot, like hand-eye cordiantion. Think about it, you might on hte computer that, but it helps. If you yourself while you are on the comp[puter you would start to see that you are typing fastre and learning where all the letters are on the keyboard now, then when you saw your first computer. Computers though, not only teaches you hand-eye cordination but it also teaches you of many wonder places. Such as @CAPS2 falls, rain forests etc. Now, dont get me wrong, @CAPS3 not saying that computer dont their downs and that people dont take advantage of computers. but, I am saying that they help society alot. They travel news fatser. Also they taught alot to people. So take my opinion into consideration. And think about how much computers have done for you."	5	4		9																					
1615	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a @ORGANIZATION1 who believes that computers have a positive effect on people for one computed help promote hand-eye coordination. @CAPS5 there is the fact that computers also help teach people about distant places and people without leaving they're home. @CAPS6 computers also allow people to talk to each other via the @CAPS3. What would we do without computer! My fist reason why I believe that computer are a good thing is hand-eye coordination. According to @PERSON1 of the @ORGANIZATION3 of the eye @CAPS4 you have to watch what keys you are using when typing, your brain builds a connection with your hand, thus better eye hand coordination, ""@CAPS5 there is the fact that millions of @LOCATION1 are in car acidents a year, wich @PERCENT1 are cause by the fact that the driver of a vehicle had to look down at the whey to make that they kept thier car. On that road, this being that they have no eye hand coordination, @CAPS6 I that it computers were in the of every person in the world there would be less acidents a year. Secondly there is the fact that a computer can transport somebody in there mind. to a distant and or person. A study at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that @PERCENT2 of people surveyed can find information on the @CAPS3 faster than they can in a @CAPS7 there is the fact that a child of any age can use a computer to find the specific information it needs in a matter of seconds. @CAPS6 I have observed that children know how to use the @CAPS3 but not a dictionary or encyclopedia, @CAPS6 there is the fact that people can contact and talk to people through the @CAPS3 for one this allows you to contact a long lost friends. @CAPS5 there is the fact that you can talk to theme @CAPS5 @CAPS6. There is the fact that you can contact someone halfway around the globe just with your @CAPS3. How cool is that @CAPS9 reading this letter and sharing it to your company I believe that you should support my cause. This is @CAPS4 computers improve hand-eye coordination, link people to other people and places and @CAPS6 allow people to talk via the @CAPS3."	5	4		9																					
1643	1	"To the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, This day in age, computer technology rules the world. It's where we get our news, music, shopping and even enterteinment. Sounds great right? But there are some big downsides to this box of information. Such as, this gadget is taking over peoples lives and keeping them from excersizing. Now a days, people are even loosing human interaction from these marvelous toys. And finally, computers are very expensive electronics, they have much up keep which costs you money ultimately making you depressed. As you can see, although there are some great pros to computers, there are also pretty big downfalls that you havn't thought of yet. As I previously stated, computers are taking away from people excersicing. We're all becoming quite lazy. People rather stay at their computer screens playing grand theft auto or facebook stalking than going outside to play a game of soccer with your friends at the empty field down the street. @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 goes without physical domain for at least a @DATE1 and a half. @PERCENT2 of those people rather just tay at home on their computers. This is a disgrace! We cannot let this continue. We must change the way we live and get rid of this unhealthy appliance we call a computer. Of all my reason that computers are bed, this is by far the most disturbing. People are having less, and less human interactions as computers become more popular. Now you, can d everything from your computer. Soon people will be marrying them. Oh wait, that's already happened. Just yesterday, I read in the newest issue of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 that a man married a character in his computer game. There was a priest present and everything. They just recently got back from their honeymoon. This is sad! Look at what our world has become. People rather marry a computer character than actually communicate with real people. We must act quick, I don't know what will happen next. Finally, computer cost a lot of money. You pay @MONEY1 for the computer outright, but then you have all the up keep and there is lots of up keep. Computers are very troublesome. You just keep pouring money into it, which is just depressing. It will just break again soon or freeze and cause you to loose a report you've worked on all night. For example, @DATE1 my dad had to pay @MONEY2 in order to get my @DATE1 computer unbugged. He was so reluctant to even pay it and afterwards he was annoyed all week for even-paying it. It got even worse when it froze up a week later. He was freaking out. Thats all you get from computers, more and more frustration. I just don't think it's worth it."	6	5		11																					
1648	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people. With a computer you could do so many things! They provide plenty of information, communication, and even entertainment. The only reason some find it to be unhealthy or negative is because some people abuse their ""computer-time"". Ever used the popular website ww.google.com? Sites like this, and many more, are great when you need information. Your practically just type in a word and automatically have hundreds or thousands of links, containing information on that word, to choose from! How could so much knowledge be named unhealthy, or have a negative effect on people? Computers have dictionaries, references, translators, encyclopedias, or even history pages that hold massive informatiion. So go ahead and expand your knowledge! If you log onto one of the most famous and well-used social networking websites, such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, you will find a new way to communicate with friends and family. Equipped with tools and various settings to keep you safe, you can find long-lost friends or out-of-touch family members and instantly catch up. Again, many people abuse those websites, putting up harmful words, inappropriate things, but that problem can be easily solved if you ""report' them to the website manager or to an adult. You just have to know how to be safe online, if not, the computer can be a very negative object for you. If you know how to use it right, you'll enjoy messages from family or instant messages from friends. There is a wide variety of entertainment on your computer. From video-sharing websites like www.youtube.com. to gaming websites like www.onemorelevel.com. These sites provide games and many videos, or even learning aids. There are sites where you can purchase music ang movies, or even clothes and furniature. Many stores have online websites wher you can purchase items and have them shipped to your front door. How could that possibly be regroup? Also, there are video games that are specially created for the computer, that you can buy, and have installed for isntant entetainment. I mean, who doesn't like to play games or shop, without having to go through the trouble of finding time to go out and do it? I know my aunts do. So you see, computers aren't negative, unless you abuse your ""computer-time"" and waste countless hours for no reason. You need to have a limit. Without it, it's just plain weird spending all day on a computer. So have fun! Learn, communicate, entertain youself."	6	5		11																					
1652	1	"Dear local news paper, @CAPS1 computers is a good idea because every developed country uses computers. Also they @CAPS2 learning, fertileze comunication, and are comercialy implortant.

Computers alow me to learn about new @NUM1, learning about cultures all over the world can be done by computers. The last way computers @CAPS2 learning is by informing us about everyday thing like to get a stain out, how to pronounce a word, how to make a new dish, and much more.

The last reason computers are important is for the commercial stand point computer help alot of small bussness out by letting than be known.

My three reason why you should have a computer is you can talk online with your friend or do homework or project and fine out @LOCATION1 things out. Therefore I think if you like doing that then the computer is what you need. My first reason is talking online. People talk online so they can talk to there friend @PERSON1. If you talk oline you can figure out what was homework or whens the meeting or the time the party starts. You can also talk online with your friends or family the moved or lives far away around @LOCATION2. My second reason is doing homework. Sometimes you need the computer to do your homework. You need the computer so you can print picture for your report. You wil also need to type yout report on your vaction. The computer also help you fine the history or @CAPS2 book online so you can do your homework or project. My third reason is finding out @LOCATION1 things. You fine out how old is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or how tall is @ORGANIZATION1. You can also figure out how to spell a big word. You can fine out many hallway can take you to @LOCATION1 or @CAPS5 beach or other places. Fine out where the wall of @LOCATION3 is.

Some computers are also just for at home use and are used to contact family members and find information that you @MONTH1 need instantly or wouldn't be able to find any were. Computers are still developing and are becoming faster and better day after day and most likely will never be put out of use but then does not mean they will permanently restrict you from othere activeties. It is true some people do spend to much time on computer but not everyone does, some people work from home computer and can not help being on it because it is their job. I implore you to consider the resonse computers are used so much and to understand that computers are used to help not hurt people. Computers are very helpfull in simplying things and are very useful for information. I stand strong with the use of computers and strongly disagree that they negatively affect hte way of human life. Computers do th things people would normaly not do for example someone would not go and look up every thing he or she needs to know in a look because there be only certain facts there looking for and it would also be easy to compare and contrast information on a computer rather than reading several diferent books. So if you truly think about it computers save us a tremendus amount of time with the things we do. Once again I say ""computers better owe life not hurt it."""	4	4		8																					
1662	1	"Dear local newspaper, Computers are effecting more and more people in the society instead of helping. A boy named, @PERSON1 started to have many health problems afer he had bought a computer. The computer that he thought uses helping him wasn’t any help at all. His health issues started to get worse. He soon started to be out of breath more always have a high blood pressure and he started to become overweight. Since he had this computer he didn't exercise or got out to spend time with his family and friends as much as he was on the internet. Computers aren't helpful, my opinion is that all they is waste time, lose your education and can make you unhealthy. As you @MONTH1 already know computer can do a lot to help you but there are some things that you don't know about computers. According to a health magazine, tests shows that using a computer for two or three hours can make you lose @PERCENT1of your brain cells.

1671	1	"@CAPS8 more and more technology is being invented, people use the computer to do work and to learn. But more time on the computer is not neccessarily a good thing. People do not exercise enough, strain their eyes, and have less interaction with real people. One reason computers are having negative affect on people is because they no longer get enough exercise. Take my freind @CAPS1 for example. He was a triathlete, who trained everyday so he could be in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3-@CAPS4 man in @LOCATION1 next @DATE1. But then he got his computer. @CAPS1 had suddenly lost interest in exercise and spend his whole day checking his e-mail instead of training.

However, they are not taught how bad they can be for you health when used too much." @CAPS6, computers are a problem to our health. Another reason computers are a problem is because they strain you eyes. When my school had disabled people come and talk to us @DATE1, there was a blind lady named @PERSON5, who lost her sight because she was a workaholic and spend too much time on her laptop. But she is not the only one to lose her vision because of computers. Scientests at the @CAPS7 lab in @LOCATION2 said that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 regular computer users lost their vision within two years. One of these scientist, @PERSON3, reported, "@CAPS8 more people begin to use the computer, more people seriously hurt their eyes or even lose their vision. We estimate @PERCENT2 of this next generation will be legally blind before age @NUM3." @CAPS9, this new technology is harmful and very damaging to our vision. A third reason people should not use computer is because they stop interacting with real people. My uncle, @PERSON4, lives in @LOCATION3. We used to see each other from time to time and talk on the phone about once a week. That is, until he found out about the chat rooms and virtual worlds on the internet. Now, I haven't seen or talked to him in almost a @DATE1 because he has created a new family on the computer and spends the whole day pretending he is a @CAPS10 an fighting dragons on the internet game @CAPS10 @CAPS11. But he is not the only person with this issue. It is proven that @PERCENT3 of people who go into games like these or chatrooms lose interest in friends and family and their social skills worsen. Professor @PERSON2 had this to say about how this is affecting @CAPS5. "Too many @CAPS5 are finding out about these sites and getting hooked. They stop caring about school, sports, even their friends. It's alarming!" @CAPS12 reason could you have to use a computer after learning how bad it is for you and your @CAPS5! Computers will bring nothing but grief to humanity. They are extremely dangerous for our health. They cause us to stop exercising and gain weight, permanently damage our eyes, and deny us of the proper socialization that all people need to be happy and health.

Another thing that is great about computers is, you can research anything you need to, for projects, jobs, homework, and things for school, etc. The top websites people use for resources are, @CAPS1.com @LOCATION1. etc. Computers are also great for typing out reports , making powerpoints for jobs and projects, and so much more! Anything you could think of is most likely found in a computer. As, you can see a computer is so helpful and is a great resource. having a computer at home is much better than taking a trip down to the public library save time and money from taking all those trips and get your own personal library ny getting a computer. you never know what new technology could bring."	3	3		6																					
1678	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2: The effects computers have on people are bad because they are getting too addicted, the computers is a dangerous site to go on, and their brain is smarter then the @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION1, they are getting too addicting because computers @MONTH1 have a benefit of you being able to serf the internet but you'll get hooked on it too much. For example, youtube is an internet siting that about @NUM1 people go on and barely get off. The people don't turn off their computers to just go get some exercise but just sit there staring at the @CAPS5 and messing up their eyesite. These people need to learn have the will power to get off the @CAPS5. Second, the @CAPS5 is a dangerous site to go on because some people in the @LOCATION1 give somebody their @CAPS3 on the @CAPS5 to somebody they don't know about. Almost @PERCENT2 of teens get kidnapped because od giving their @CAPS3 a way to stranger and @PERCENT3 of those teens don't get found. The @CAPS5 is also a place of where a child or teen @MONTH1 get cyber bullied. Cyberbullying is harrassing children or teens on the internet, when children under or over @NUM2 get cyberbullied they sometimes suffer through a deppression and don't tell their parents about it. Six months ago at my old @CAPS4, there was a volunteer at my @CAPS4 talking about cyberbullying and how he got so depressed because of the harrassment, that he commited suicide. The @CAPS5 is not always a safe place to be on. Finally, your brain more smarter than the @CAPS5.People can have the ability to depend more on their brains than on the their computers because your brains are like computers. About @PERCENT1 of people use their brain more often than computers and they have been successful through life. The brain is like a @CAPS5 because you can store information and nobody can hack into it. So therefore, computers have bad effects on people because they are getting to addicting, the @CAPS5 is a dangerous site to go on, and your brain is smarter than tha @CAPS5."	4	4		8

1693	1	"Dear Newspaper, Have you notice that now a days more and more people are becoming overweight? Well its true. People say that it is because of eat a lot of fast food but I think that since we are always on the computer and not excersing helps contribute to it. Also as the technology is getting better it is keeping people from going outside and enjoying the beautiful nature. Sitting infront of the computer isn't going to help our environment. Lastly, kids aren't getting out of their house to interact with friends and family because technology has been able to let us communicate without leaving our house. @CAPS1 not saying that we should downgrade our technology, but we need to find a way limit it. To start on with, technology has a role in the increasing rate of obesity. Some @MONTH1 say that people chose not to excerise but if we limit things then they won't have to chose. As a kid myself, I love to be on the computer. My parents are always trying to get the computer and take the dogs for a walk and I always say ""@CAPS1 busy"" @CAPS2 its true, I don't really like to go outside because I have a computer to play games or talk to friends and to be honest excersing to me seems important but I don't do it because I'm always on the computer. I think that other people could feel this way so thats why we need to limit the computer. Secondly, global warming is occuring right now and people would rather be inside on the computer then go outside and enjoy the nature. @CAPS2, you @MONTH1 be able to look up ways to stop global warming, but does it mean you are going to really do it? Some @MONTH1 not because they could just stay on the computer and keep ""@CAPS3 up"" ways to help another things is that when we use our computers, we use electricity, which adds to global warming so it we limit the use of computers then people could go enjoy nature and not destroy it. Lastly, internet sites like myspace, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, etc have allowed us to communicate with friends and family but we are still not able to get out and interact with them. When we get out and interact with our friends we gain like communication teamwork and respect friend and family can teach you this with them the computer they can't. Also interacting with your family and friend @MONTH1 let you go in new places that you haven't been before and on the computer you can't go there. Interacting with friends & family is better than talk thru the computer. In conclusion if we stay on the computer then we won't get excerise enjoy nature or interact with friends. So we need to act now limit compute usage!"	5	5		10																					
1695	1	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 know, @CAPS2 people are starting to buy and own computers. Some experts say this is a bad thing and that we should spend more time outdoors. I disagree with this statement. First, computers help us with every day life. We check news on computers, some people even use their computers @CAPS1 a @CAPS3 and watch important shows. Second, a computer is a great way to comunicate. @CAPS10 its friends, family or even buisness, a computer is a excelent way of communication. finally, a computer is help when it comes to school or work. You could write a paper on the computer for example read on to see how I support my reasons of why computers are helpful in peoples lives. Have you ever had a time when you see something on the news that you want to learn more about? Well, @CAPS10 you had a computer, you could go online to the news website and read more. This is only one way a computer comes in handy in every day life, there are plenty more. Another way is @CAPS10 you don't own a @CAPS3, you could watch your favorite show on the computer. My english teacher @PERSON1 says ""I never owned a @CAPS3, I only watch @CAPS3 on my computer and I like it better"" In fact @PERCENT1 of people who watch videos on the computer like it better than @CAPS3. This is how computers come in handy in every day life. I love how computers have @CAPS2 ways of comunicating. I like it because I have @CAPS2 relatives who live far away and I use my computer to comunicate with them from time to time. Skype is my favorite, I can see the person @CAPS8 talking to at the same time. Also computers can be good for business for large companies who need to comunicate out of the contry. I'm sure being a amazing newspaper company, you could use a way of easy comunication. finally, comunication with friends. These are @CAPS2 programs for this, @CAPS9 @CAPS1 facebook and myspace. This is why a computer is a good way of comunication. finally, computers can be useful for schools and work. You can type a paper or news article on the computer. It's much faster than writing. Also, @CAPS10 you need more info on something, you could look it up online. like @CAPS10 you are writing an article on dolphins, you could learn more about them. In conclusion I think computers are good things. They help with everyday life, They are good for comunication. And last they help at school or work."	4	5		9																					
1702	1	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I as a computer user, think computers are helpfull in many ways. They help get new @CAPS3. They help function machines. They help people learn new things. Computers help find and get new @CAPS3. They provide the public in another way to find a new or another job. My brother; for example, @CAPS4 went to a university there @CAPS4 learned how to become a micanic. @CAPS4 was having a hard time finding a job, (looking for me on the street) so somone told him to go on @CAPS1.com and go to ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"" @CAPS4 did and there on the computer @CAPS4 found a good job and still works there. The computer or great way to find a job. Computers help function machines. All the machines that we have to use and had to run by hand now run by computers. That is good in someway and bad on another way. They help make more product in less time. Today more cars are being made in less time if you've seen sometimes in of cars you saw the assemble line with michanical robot hands putting them together and that is using computers. One major problem to this is many people are lossing their @CAPS3. The computer teacher people"	4	4		8																					
1708	1	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers: well computers are a big thing now a days, you can look up information, learn new things, and it, keep you busy. It brings a whole package. Learning and getting information like facts, past, the @CAPS1 it helps us understand what we are living around and know how things came together a computer is like a trip to the library, all the information is pretty much the samo. You can look things uo for a project or too much.

Looking up info, learn now it's entertainment, are some or laptop they bring"	4	3		7																					
1709	1	"Everyone loves staying on the computer. I would be surprised if one does not. I believe the whole issue is that the machine itself distracts you from other things in your life that is also as enjoyable on it is. People learn too much on it. It changes peoples whole life. The computer is like a disease or a virus that controles you and gaining your freedom from it perfectly possible. I understand that some people @MONTH1 not agree with me, however I propose that my side is the best. This is horrible. How can it? It distracts people from their life. I makes them blind to enjoy nature. Spending too much time on the computer is a horrible disease. The hard part is to get in your freedom is being able to know that it is ocntroling you. That way your door to freedom will be open. The tecknologie keeps you away from having fun, doing homework from school and having fun with friends. I know that you can break free from it because I once experienced the same thing. Technology is a beautiful thing indeed. I has so many information in it you wont even think a person it. I know even more than . However it is also very foul. Once I came up on a very horrible seen on the computer. I my i can shut it . Michines have a mind that it our and anything it. Changing a persons life is not easy. You become complitely new. Sometimes those changes are good sometimes they are bad. But a michine can make you change in ten minutes. Once you see what you like on it or what you want you can change. If you see something and you want it so bad. I you cant get if then you will be forced to get it by stealing. It is a very horrible thing to learn. All you have to do is learn to controle your self. Machines are a very bad influence on people. There are book if you need information. Computers make you lazy you don't have to read or anything it does it for you. It take over your life. You become . It teaches you bad thing it changes your life. What path would you take"	4	4		8																					
1710	1	"Wouldn't you agree that computers have a great affect on people. The three reason why they have a good affect on people is because, it gives you good typing skills, its educational, and it helps you out with alot of things. The first reason why computers have a good affect on people is because computers help your typing skills. If you have a computer you will soon learn that your typing skills get very good. Each time you use the computer your hands ajust to the keys on the computer. Say if there is someone that wants to work with computers when they get older, well if they practice their typing on their computers at home they will be eligible for the job working with computers. Also computers could be good for the hearing impared. If the hearing impared use to the computers then they can get a @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 and chat with people online. This would be useful to them because since they could not hear what people say they can read what people say through the internet. Another reason why computers have a good affect on people is because they are very educational. In my opinion, computers are very educational because there are alot of websites that teach you facts about different places. For example, what food people eat in different countrys, or where that country is. A website that is the best for finding out accurate facts is www.Ask.com. Ask.com is the best website because it tells you what ever you want to know in a matter of seconds. Computers are also educational when it comes to school projects because of these amazing websites. The last reason why computers have a affect on people is because they help you with alot of things. They help you with alot of things because if you want to know how far @LOCATION2 is from @LOCATION1 then you can go on your pc and find out, or say that you lost the directions to your friends house and your on your way to their house if you brought your labtop you can go on the labtap and find where her house is from your labtop. I know your probably thinking there is such thing as a gps, well if you think about it gps's can be confusing, but your computer reads it out to you. Know your probably saying in your heads why don't you text/call @CAPS3/@CAPS4 if you think about it what if your friend does not talk clearly. In conclusion, wouldn't you agree that computers do have good effects on people. My three arguments are, they help your typing skill educational. They help you with things. please take my ideas into consideration."	4	5		9																					
1713	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think people should stop going on the computer? Well, yes because they are not getting exercise. People's body start to get lazy and don't want to get up. They are not spending time with the family instead they would like to spend their free time on the @CAPS3. This is my people should stop being lazy and have some fresh air. @CAPS2 you people who spend time on the computer interact with their family? Well, no, because they think they will get entertain by technology instead of their family. The reason I don't like compter so much because you get hook on so fast you can't stop. When you interact will family you get to know them better and that is priceless. This is why it should stop because it damage peoples minds. Another reasons I would like you to hear is less time exercising. When people don't exercise you will @CAPS2 anything to their body. They start to eat too much and later they become very lazy. When you exercise you have tons of energy to @CAPS2 anything. Like bunge jump. When you excerise you look healthy and people will notive. This why excerise is the best healthy and always fit. In addition, my third reason I would like you to read is enjoying nature. Enjoying nature you can have a good time and relax. You can swim in the beach, feel the amazing breeze, and have a good time. When you are on the computer you are sitting down instead going outside and that because a habit. It will be hurting are environment because people don't want to get up to enjoy nature. This is why it should not be tollerated because people are being lazy. In conclusion, the reason why people should not spend their life on computer because they think they will be entertain by technology instead of interacting will their family. People will start eating too much and so they will become lazy. People will never leave the house and instead they are on their computer. This is why it should stop it hurting are environment people are becoming lazy."	4	4		8																					
1716	1	"People think that useing computers is a good thing, I think so to because there are alot of other people in this country that speak different languages and the computers can teach them insted of a person that just speaks our language. This for some people is their lives even alot of people use computers for their work. Kids also use the internet not for things such as, facebook, myspace, gmail, and alot of other web pages, I also use the internet but not as much anymore but I used to go on gaming pages like, @NUM1.com or even /cup/coffee but I dont go on those anymore that much because I have xbox live and that is a thing that the internet also comes in and you can talk to your friends. Some of my friends just fo on the computer and dont get any exercise at all but alot of my friends go on it but play alot of sports so there not just getting fat all the time. So people in the world basically have a computer but not everyone in @LOCATION2 of @LOCATION1, I think that our country should write a big pay check to those poor country and so they can get computers and so if they come here they can speak our language, or we ship that of computers to their countrys and so they dont buy any crappy computers. Also when your on a computer you can buy a webcam or it is already placed into your computer and you can talk to your friends or even show them that what you made or something like that. So I think that computers are the best thing that we ever invented or who ever do."	3	4		7																					
1717	1	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I want to argue about the issue of computer use in @LOCATION1, @CAPS3, I'll tell you about the benefits of owning a computer. Then, I'll talk about the whole computer network. Finally, I'll talk about the advances in technology due to the computer. I think the use of computers in our town are very good for society. There are the major benefits of using a computer. @CAPS3 is the fact you can use microsoft to write up a paper. Sixth grader @PERSON6 says, ""I would rather type than write a paper. Another reason to use a computer is a for research."" @CAPS4 many articles and facts are online about anything you need,"" says @PERSON4. The final benefit of a computer is the fact you can know about world news in a flash. ""I would've never known about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 without seeing the article on @CAPS2 homepage,"" says @PERSON5. Those are just some of the major benefits that the kids do on their computer. Now lets talk about something. That is said to be bad but really isnt; social networking. Stuff like @CAPS5 use a texting form on a computer which helps us connect without making a huge phone bill: with instant messanger I can talk to @CAPS2 girlfriends,"" says @PERSON2. Also, there is facebook which can help us connect on a global stage. ""I can talk with @CAPS2 cousin in @LOCATION2,"" says @CAPS6. Those are the major social networking tools we use to talk to people around the world. One thing that is important about the computer is the advances in technology caused by it. @CAPS3, we have the laptop which is a portable computer we can take anywhere. ""I can use @CAPS2 computer anywhere I like,"" says @PERSON7. Also, the memory card which allows us to save data on a computer and take it to school or work. Eigth grader @CAPS7 says, ""I can take work I didn't finish in school home with the stick."" The final major advance is the use of the printer,"" I use @CAPS2 printer to print of papers to bring to school,"" @PERSON3 said. Those are some of the major advances caused by the computer. That's why I think using the computer is good for us. There is many benefits to owning a computer. We talk to people world-wide when ever we want to. The computer has even been the sole purpose for many other ground breaking improvements in technology. @CAPS4 please help defend us kids in this case about computer use."	4	4		8																					
1722	1	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 people are talking about computers and what it does to us. People believe that using the computer is a waste of time. I believe that computers aren't a bad thing. Using the computers can help us learn about other places in the world. It can also show us the lives about people from the past. We can also talk to our friends online. If you want to know why computers are useful, just keep on reading. People say that computers waste our lives. I disagree with that opinion. The internet is a great way to learn about different places in the world. We can learn about the climate. The animals, and the food they eat. @CAPS1 palces have different types of culture. For example, in @LOCATION3 everyone eats seafood. In @LOCATION2, everyone eats spicy food. The internet can show us pictures of beautiful places that we have never seen before. It's a great way to see and learn about different places compared to how you live. Do you have a friend that you haven't seen in a long time? Would you like to be in contact with that person again? Well the internet is a great way to do this. It allows you to make an account such as twitter, facebook, @NUM1 and more. You can search up your friends name and magic! You finally have the chance to talk to your old pal again. You would be thrilled to be able to talk with them again. @CAPS1 kids use the computer in order to do their history projects. Well the internet is here to help. You can search up famous people from the past or people from now adays. The internet allows you to see and learn about these people's past. One example is @LOCATION1. He was the first president of the @ORGANIZATION1. You can learn so much about him like where he was born, how @CAPS1 family relatives did he have and more. So you see, the internet is a great use for kids. These are my reasons in why I believe that computers aren't bad. We still have time for family, friends and any fun outdoor activity. We can learn about different places in the world. We can talk to friends online, and we can learn about people from the past."	4	5		9																					
1724	1	"Dear NewsPaper @CAPS1, Have you ever taken into consideration how much an effect technology has on our society? Well, for numerous people, computers are their lives. They help adults stay in contact with their friends. Also, it gives users usefull information about anything you can think of. Computers are a great tool to help us with our lives, they help us learn skills for later in life. People who use computers do not spend too much time on them, we need them to live a good life. For example, the internet has many websites that keep people in touch. There are countless sites and to name a few, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, the list goes on and on. Many adults begin to realize that childhood friends seem to fade away as time goes on. With computers, you can chat with each other all night. In @CAPS4, it is also a convienient way to contact friends if they live in different places around the @LOCATION1. Moreover, computers are chock full of information. If a family wanted to take a vacation, they could use the computer to find a place they would enjoy and book a flight there. Also, if a student needed to do a report and was not able to go to the library, he/she would be able to use the computer to get the info for the report. Lastly if someone had an ailment and didn't know it was serious enough for a visit to the doctors office, they could look it up on the internet. they also have many sites for that sole purpose such as @ORGANIZATION2. Lastly, computer users learn valuable skills that these who don't will never have. Just knowing how to work one is an important skill but there are many features computers have that will help when a job or in college. For instance, making a power point for jobs or just slideshows of a party in your back yard. In @CAPS4 , typing is a valuable skill that most jobs nowadays require. And using the computer fine tunes hand-eye coordination. Although some @MONTH1 say that staring at a screen all day isn't healthy, @CAPS5 of @CAPS6.S.A citizens say using the computer is healthy for their social lives and we should use it in moderation. Computers are amazing tools if used properly and in moderation. The time has come to tell the people computers are usefull to society. They help social lives, teach us skills and, give us information on countless topics. People need them to have an enjoyable life. So, write an article regarding the need for the use of computers @DATE1 and notify the people they are making the right decision by using them. "	5	5		10																					
1731	1	"Dear Local Newspaper, ""@CAPS1 people have any viruses in there head?"" @CAPS2 they need a maricle to pop up away from the computer. Why I stated that is @CAPS2 its unhealthy for many people. Its not using time wisely. But most importantly, it can get you into trouble you don't want to be in. Stick around if you want the anecdote for the computer virus so people can be cured. OMG!!! My stepfather needs to get of the computer! It's unhealthy the amount of time he spends online. He needs to get up and move around. But instead he just sit there online everyday eating. Another reason why its unhealthy is, as you get older your bone's get weaker and when your old you can't move lik you use to and want to. Man just think, if we didn't have a computer, all the time/money people spend on computers can be spent for stuff more useful. For example @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people love computers more than life itself. @PERCENT1 of the world spend their time doing somthing active instead of being on the computer."" @CAPS3 an computer is nice but you got to know that you, can't get controlled by it. ALERT! ALERT!!! Sirence is getting closer and closer to my house. I am getting scared @CAPS2 I am online and i'm wondering if i did anything wrong. But it wasn't me who the cops was coming for, it was my next door neighbor. I guess he was doing illegal stuff online that he had no buisness doing. See computer's can get you into trouble. For example, I remember when i got into trouble with my parents and they look the computer away from me. Now, you know why computers effect people. How unhealthy it is, to many people. Why it takes up so much time from people's life. And all the trouble it puts people through."	5	4		9																					
1743	1	"Dear local newspaper, I beileve that using computers is a good idea and will help people. So many people all over the world have computers. Computers are good because they help kids learn, communicate with others, and help teach responsibility. Please just listen to what I have to say. First, I beileve that computers help kids learn. If you buy computer games like a cooking game you can learn how to cook. Even if you buy the @PERSON1 you are still learning by taking care of them. There are so many good websites that you can go on like @ORGANIZATION1. People learn through playing new things and why not play with your favorite characters. Also, you can go on google and type in anything you want and it will give you the answer. You use a keyboard for all this so you also learn how to type. If your teacher gives you a homework assingment why not type it so you learn that skill. This is why computers are good for hearg kids learn. Secondly, you can communicate with others from around the word or just your friends. There is a thing called @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2. You use a webcam and talk to anyone you want. There are also websites you can go on too communicate with people from all around the world. It is pretty cool because you don't have to travel there to talk to them. All of this stuff teaches you how people are different and no one person is the same. Peoples language could be different or there personality. So many communicating things make computers even better. Lastly, using computers helps teach responsibility. Kids who use internet know that poeple need privacy and that comes with responsibility because you should know that. If someone dosen't want to be bothered then don't bother them that has to do with privacy. Also, you learn to be nice on computers. If you video chatted you should definitely know to be nice and not be rude. That is how you get kicked off of these things. Another thing is people learn to take care of things a computer is worth a lot of money. Not everyone has one so you should be thankful for what you have. Don't brag, but just know you are privleged for a computer. These things are the reasons computers are good. So if you ever consider getting a computer the answer is yes because computers help kids learn, you can communicate with others, and you learn responsibility. Now you know computers are really good for kids not that bad."	4	5		9																					
1748	1	"Dear local newspaper: I strongly feel that computer technology has a neagtive affect on the people of our society. People of our society are spending to much time on computers, and not enough time exersizing and interacting with family and friends. By starting now we can make a difference in the lives of thousands. First off I would like to say that it is imporitive that we exersize daily. If we don't fit exersizing into our day to day schedual, we are potentally putting our health on the line. Activities such as taking a dog for a walk, riding a bike, or taking a nice jog through the park are just a few ways to help your physical fitness. Also taking part in extracuricular activities can play a major part in exersize. This not only helps physically, but it helps mentally too. Finnally another method of exersizing is to play a part in your local community service projects. Exersizing every day is just one way to keep you active and off the computer. Lastly, interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer. Playing games is one way that can help you stay connected with your family. This can bring you closer to the people you love, and help them get to know you a little better. Furthermore you can play with your friends, and in the process develops social skills. Who knows developing social skills could help you in the future. Plus, by interacting with family and friends you can learn to be relaxed and let your life take its natural source. This is another helpful technique that can improve the quality of your life and keep you from the temptation of being on the computer. In conclusion techniques like exersizing and interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer. By working together and trying these methods, the computer can be eliminated from our daily rutines."	4	5		9

For example, my cousin is in @LOCATION1 a sometimes we will go on the computer and talk to on video chat. Without this, we would have no communication with him. Many people around the world use computers to communicate. This is how people use computers to stay in touch. Also, computers are amazing now and they're only going to get better.

As i mentioned, everyone who is using a computer on a daily basis, will drop their communication skills.. People enter chat rooms not knowing who they are talking to. For example, if i logged onto & chat room, someone might ask for personal information such as where you live, your phone number & your name. This could lead to things such as kidnaping & even rape. Also, interactions with family members & friends @MONTH1 decrease. You can be playing a computer game, online, or going on youtube to watch random videos of people. You tube in said to be a dangerous site for younger children. Kids could go under history to go to a website they were recently on when click the wrong one bringing them inapropiate website. Finally, teenagers and adults go onto facebook & twitter. Some @MONTH1 say these sites @MONTH1 change the social interactions, but it really isn't. Kids & adults are constantly getting addicted to it. Also telling people what you are doing every moments of your day everyday is kind of unreal. People don't need to know when you do things in your day i have keep up this our communication skills are sure to decrease. Secondly, exersice is a problem. Doctors say that @PERCENT1 of their parents are obeise or over weight according to @ORGANIZATION1. Kid just sit at home & play computer games such as sims @NUM1 & video chat with their friends instead of hanging out with them. No one really goes for walks any more either. Also, people don't go out & enjoy nature like the you. @PERSON1, a state @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION2 said, ""each year the number of people are getting fewer & fewer. Preety soon all parks are going to have to get closed down."" @CAPS2 don't want this to happen, do you? I know i would not. Our generations are just becoming more technology enhanced. Finally, more & more people are becomeing unhealthy. A person's eye sight is most likely to drop if they are on the computer everyday. My aunt is required to use her computer everyday at work. She went to her eye doctor because her vision was become weaker. One of the first questions he aske was, do you use a computer on a daily basis? she answered yes. He said she would need cataraks eye surgery. This was all in result of using a computer. Finally, you could get althritis in your hands & fingers from typing & using the mouse all the time. Many people at the age of fourty are probaly going to need hand surgeries from all the work the do, likes! As you can see technology is harming your communication skills, exersice & you health. I bet you don't want your future generations like this. So take a part & contact your local newspaper today."	5	5		10																					
1760	1	"I think we can all agree that computer usage is a very controversal issue. In my opinion, I believe that computers have a negative effect on people. For instance, it's not safe and children can get into all sorts of things on the internet. Also, people spend too much time in front the computer now a days, @CAPS1, its a major distraction and also a negetive effect on kids. school work. It's now or never! Do we dicide that computers have a negetive effect? You decide! Isn't every parents biggest concern the safety of their children? When on the internet, kids are capable of accessing anything and everything. Sometimes kids don't even look for bad things, they just pop up. Would you want your child veiwing things that you have no control over? Also, websites like @CAPS2.com one one of the greatest concerns when it comes to internet safety. Although you are supposed to be at least @NUM1 to have a @CAPS2, most kids lie about their age. Did you know that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 @CAPS2 users lie about their age? And it's not always a @NUM4 year old saying they are @NUM1, it could be a @NUM6 year old saying they're @NUM7! Not only do people lie about their age, they lie about who they are. Is this the kind of internet exposer you want for your children? Put a stop to this right now! More than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are overweight and unhealthy. This is another negetive effect computers have on people. It's a gorgeous @DATE1 day. Bright blue skies, cotton candy cloulds, the sun is shining, and there's a nice warm breece. Perfect day to go out and get active, right? Wrong! None people would @CAPS5 be inside on the computer. Instead of going for a walk, people would @CAPS5 spend hours on facebook. This is a serious concern to our health. People don't exercise enough as it is, and then when you add computers, people will never get active! Instead of playing video games onlin, people need to be reminded that turning off the computer and playing a fun beighborhood game of baseball is just as fun and much more beneficial. This is just one step @CAPS3 need to take to get a healthier lifestyle. Wouldn't you agree? Did you know that kids that spend more time on computer are more likely to do poorly in school? Surely, if nothing else will convince you of the negetive effects of a computer this will @CAPS5 than coming home and doing homework, more time is spent in front of the computer. As a student, I will admit that the computer is a very tempting distraction and can easily pull a student away from their studies. You can't expect a child to make the right decision and tell their they have to go because they need to study. So you do! Take action now, or your child will definately suffer. The time has come to decide. Do you believe Computers have a negative effect on people? It's clear that the computer is not safe. Not to mention, too much time is spent on the computer instead of being active. Most importantly, computers will negetively affect children's grades. Don't wait another minute! Let's agree and do something about this!"	6	6		12																					
1766	1	"Man has always been interested in technology. Computers are just one part. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand eye coordination, saves trees, and allows people to learn about everything. Hand-eye coordination is a key part in our every day lives. Driving a car or writting all invile hand-eye coordination. I remember a few years ago I didn't have a great hand-eye coordination I had trouble catching a ball. Now days I spend up to on hour and a half on the computers. I have noticed my hand get neater and I can catch a balls with ease now. Do you want to be the one to crash your car because you have bad hand-eye coordination? Computers not only increase your hand-eye coordination they save trees too. Using a computer dosn't need any paper. You can read and write with out using a single sheet of paper. Since the computer @PERCENT1 of tree cutting has stopped. Saving trees help us stay alive. Trees put out the oxegyn that we breath in. Some say that computers are causing people to spend less time enjoying nature. I think that if it wasn't for computers we wouldn't have much nature to enjoy anyway. Lastly computer help people all around the world learn about almost anything. I scince kid, the head scientist says that ""with the computer we are able to toll the world of our discoveries much."" @CAPS1. @PERSON1 say ""@CAPS2 many people are laying had their die to the computer, they learn @CAPS2 many nutrition facts from the health sites"". Thanks to the computer we found a doctor to help my dad get fixed. The average people can learn about non average things any day. There are even dictionarys on the internet with many diffent translations that you would normily need about @NUM1 books to do. The computer is one of the greatest techlonagicly advances to this day. It has help our world is @CAPS2 many different ways too. Hand-eye coordination is @CAPS2 important and is preserving our environment. If you don't have knowledge you cant get anywhere in life. Our whole world senses is. "	4	4		8																					
1768	1	"I think the effects of the computer are bad, these are my three reasons why I think its bad; @CAPS1, the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time or hours on their computers, @CAPS2, people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computers, @CAPS3, people need to use computers out a less time. These are the three reasons why I think the effects of the computer are bad. The @CAPS1 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that computer could cause couse blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computers because the screen of the computer has too much light, people can't just stop staring at the monitor and even worse they could probably lost their sight and they will end up with blindness. That's why you have to be away from the screen but, being too long on your computer is bad. This is my @CAPS1 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad because the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computers. The @CAPS2 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computers because when people are on their computers too much time they just couldn't come down stairs talk with their family of friends, they could'nt go outside and enjoy the glory of nature and the enjoyment at the outside world, and also if they had nothing they can just read a book, draw, watch the @CAPS4, etc. They could do those things rather than wasting their time on their computers. This is my @CAPS2 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computers. The last reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that people need to use their computer for a less time because when people use their computer for a less time it is good because now they finally could be with their family and friends and spend so much time with them. It also good to saving energy, and prevent you from paying alot of electrical bill, and also it is good to finally let your vision of the eyes to relax. In conclusion, the three reasons; @CAPS1, the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computer. @CAPS2, people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computer, and @CAPS3, people need to use their computers for a less time will prove that the effects of the computer I think its very bad."	4	4		8																					
1769	1	"Dear editor, I think people are using computers to much and are not benifiting as much as loosing from it people are getting less exercise, not seeing nature, and not spending no much quality time with their family and friends. Read on to find ou more. First of all, people are not getting enough exersize. Especialy children, They spend to much time on computers and are becomeing over weight. America is in a crisis with child obesety. So computer have chipped into that. Many adults are over weight because they sit at computers and work as play games all day. I reason that computers are more unhealthy for us. Secondly, people are not going on hikes or trips to see the beauties of nature. Earth has many things to offer, new things to explore and discover. People can be discovering many great wonders. Finding new species, is something you need to explore nature for: animals, fish, plants, there are many out there waiting to be discovered. Reason @NUM1 why computers are not benifiting us. Thirdly, family and friends are not spending as much quality time together as they should. Realitives you talk to over computers, why not talk to them in real life. friends chatting online on facebook, aim, things like that, why not talk to each other in person and have fun memories with each other? More kids are spending time on the computer than sitting down eating a family meal together and expreriensing what a family should talk about. Reason @NUM2 on why computers are not benifitting us. In conclusion, Computers are taking over our minds and were not getting much exersise. Seeing the beauty of nature, and spending less more with their families."	4	5		9																					
1779	1	"Dear @LOCATION1, *@CAPS1*. Now I hear my favorite @CAPS2 tunes. A few clicks here and type in a word and I am watching a funny episode of ""@CAPS3 of @CAPS4 #@NUM1"". I go to my @CAPS5 page and feel the cool keys under my fingertips as I send @CAPS7 to my friend in @LOCATION3. These are only some things I can do on my computer. As you can see I need my computer for many things. I am all for using computers and I think they are a useful resorce. But @CAPS6't stop now, I have many more reasons for using computors. Thier not all that bad. Primarily, if you want to save money on gas, @CAPS6't Use @CAPS7 @CAPS8!! I can't stress @CAPS7 enough to say that if you need to talk to a friend far away @CAPS6't drive and waste gas, or even waste money on long-distance calls. Go to @CAPS5, facebook, twitter, or something that will save you gas and money. Some people want to talk to thier friends in @LOCATION2 but they @CAPS6't have any of these computer sites. Pursuade them too!! Another issue some face is, ""You need to get out and excersize."" I have only one answer. Most people @CAPS6't know the right ways to excersize. Then, they end @CAPS8 hurting themselves. If they just went online and found out that they could do a painless, priceless, fun work out that is very effective then they would not get in so much physical and finantial trouble. Also, others complain that people need to @CAPS10 more out in nature. Well, I say, what if you encounter a wild animal that you know nothing about, or say you were lost for days and didn't know what you could or could not eat? LIke I @CAPS9 say, ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11"" remember @ORGANIZATION1. FInally, if your doing a report or something formal, you want @CAPS7 to look nice, right? Well, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people in the @LOCATION4 have messy handwriting and 9/@NUM3 teachers mistake words that are messily hand-writen. This shows that if you use a computor @CAPS7 will not only show the word you wrote but also correct @CAPS7 with spell check. In conclusion, there are many benefits to using a computor. Lets recap, computors can save money, time, and gas. Computars can provide useful information in the real world. They can also correct spelling mistakes as well as prevent mistakes in legibility. Act now!!! Show others that there are benifits to using computers, show them all the wonders of this amazing machine, That is not only a time waster but a life saver."	5	5		10																					
1784	1	"Do a adults and kids spend to much time on the computer? Well I don’t think they do. Sure they use it a lot but still it's for enter to inment. Kids need to use the computer because it's another way for them to communicate with each other. Textings good but it costs money, so does to lking on the phone. If a doesn't have texting they can go on facebook or something to make make plans to do something with a friend. What if it's a rainy day outside and there's nothing to do? Well that's what a computer for.Kids use the computer for entertainment. There's tons of games to play. All on different websites of course but that's beside the point. There's mmorpg or rpg those are two type of games I can think of computers are like kids own virtual outside world. Computers are also needed to do research for school projects. Also to get pictures. Sure there book but they don't always have everything you're looking for. You can't cut pictures out of books. You need a good grade on a project. Therefore computers need to be used a lot. for communication, entertainment, and school projects."	3	4		7

When he reaches the first “town” he sees “One ramshackle sheds several rusty pumps and a coral that couldnt hold the lamesh mule.” If the setting had the problem of no water so there would be no conflict in the story, “In the story the speeker says “I was travling through the high deserts of California” that are very hot and dry, and he says “This causes the problem of it being hot and dry if the seting was a forest in @DATE1 he wouldn’t have as much of a problem needing water which would of made the story much less exciting."	2	2		2

They talking on tiv and on the radio making all this stuff they say is made up. I don’t believe to I see it. That @CAPS1 not for black people because it has not did anything to us.

5992	3	"The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe kurmaksie,greatly affect the cyclist and put him through many hardships that he probably could have avoided.The old cotagers told him about a path they thought was right,but was hard and did not get him to the right place.The features of the setting are described as “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.”"	1	1		1																					
5996	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by @PERSON1, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way the setting affects the cyclist is, in the desert, the cyclist drank more water than before. For example, the text states “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. You will drink more water in a desert than in a forest. If you go cycling, be aware of the settings around you because they will affect you."	1	1		1																					
6001	3	An example of the setting affecting the cyclist is when he has the lock of water in a ghost town in just eliterat. He frind the water but e tar like substance come out and it tasted like battery. When he left he had to go through rough road which he couldn’t travel that fast leanes of the condition of the road.	1	1		1																					
6006	3	"The settings of the story were grveling. While the cyclist was riding along, the sun was beginning to beat down on him. The cyclist began to sweat due to the heat and thus he drank just about all of his water. Now the cyclist was experiencing major heat, sweat, and dehydration. The California desert is a grveling place to be, especially in June. Luckily, the cyclist did come up to a camp and found fresh food and water, before he would eventually continue his way to Yosemite National Park"	2	2		2																					
6007	3	"As the cyclist is travelling to Yosemite National Park, he comes across many features in the area that affects him. First, he takes directions from some old guys who don’t know anything about the changes in maps because they never leave their porch. At first, it affects him in a positive way, because he thought he had a good shortcut to Yosemite. However, the affect later came negative because it turned out to be a shortcut that never existed. Another feature that affected him wasted the setting which was a desert-like area. The heat made it harder for him to ride his bike, and he also drank a lot of his water. This later resulted in him becoming dehydrated. A positive affect was when he found the bait shop, where he rehydrated himself and got some new directions."	2	3		3																					
6010	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One example is the hot sun that was beating down on him made him very thirsty. Another feature is the rough road that wore the cyclist out and made him tired. My last example is the old juice factory with the picture of a refreshing cup of juice on it made the cyclist feel like giving up because he thought he would die of dehydration. These are my reasons as to why the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways.   	1	1		1																					
6012	3	"Understanding, realitic, mode-all are reason’s how setting affects the setting. If a book has a good setting then the book might be pretty good. When you have a setting it’s more understable of what they are trying today. And if you have a good setting it makes it more realitic So when you read it you wont be thrown off, the mode of the story sets it all off, because usually books have there ups and downs. That’s why they chase the mode.  "	0	0		0																					
6015	3	"The features in the story great effect the cyclist. One feature of the setting that effects the cyclist is the heat. At first, the story says that the pine trees cooled the cyclist, but eventually the forest turned into a desert, and the heat poured down on him, make it hard to cycle. Another feature that effected the cyclist was the lack of water. As he moved away from his beginning point, the cyclist was drinking lots of water. But when he needed to refill, the water was brown and hot, so the cyclist didn’t take any. The lack of water plus the heat formed one giant obstacle that potentialy could have killed him, but through great determination the cyclist got through this troubling time."	2	2		2																					
6017	3	The setting in the story changes many times. It starts in an area with rivers and pine trees. Then the cyclist arrives ant a town. After that he is pounded by the hot sun and along hilly road. With not much water left the cyclist uses all the energy he had to get to a town where he could get something to drink. The setting was what made the cyclists journey a hard one.	1	1		1																					
6021	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist alot. The hot sun beating down on him makes him sweat and makes him thirsty. The bumpy roods and hills make him work harder. The abandoned places make him lose hope. If faced with these obstacles I would have been affected in the same way. As I believe any human would be.	1	2		2																					
6025	3	Some of the features of the setting affect the cyclist like the road was bad it had bumps all over that made it much harder and it also took up a lot of strength. Also the neighborhood of two hundre degrees after that become to a road with arore bunch of hills	1	1		1																					
6031	3	"The narration of “Rough Road ahead” a solo cyclist encounters several challenges throughout the story. The changes in his environment directly affect the completion of his journey and his health. As the narrator makes his way to Yosemite national park from the none of the old men his first encounter with his environment acknowledges his deserve and need for water. The text states “I had been huting my water pretty regularly... the high deserts of California in June”. To disappointed the truck stop’s water supply from the pumps was not adequate for his concumption, only forcing him to link elsewhere to quench his thirst next, he explenced rolling hills by exsercising more energy he made his way now everyone still in need of water. His spend lost his quickness as thoughts of his crippling dyhydration distracted him. He wer came his challenges making his was to a bate shop as the heat beat him unmercifully. The change in his environment challenged his heath and created a obstraction that nearly deterred him from his goal."	3	2		3																					
6036	3	"I think the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the terrain “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills” this shows that he is a warm and trobled by the change of the terrain. He also fells alone “I toiled on at some point tumbleweed crossed my path” he also. Though he was in a ghost town. “Summer time” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my detorating brain"" he felt that he was slowly dying. He also though he was losing it, the sun had a great impact on him because he wiped his face to make sure he was no seeing a mirage. But through it all he had hopes the author also wants us to have hope and keep on going even though things dont look good keep moving foward never look back and alway's be positive and take advanage of your surrounding.

At first the cyclist goes by river wich he wount find later in the journey.As he goes along in the journey the heat and lack of water starts to affect him. Also he finds a water fountain that pours hot water with the flavor that has long since been shut down. The cyclist is affected by many features of the setting.	1	1		1

When the old men told him to take a difficult path and did his in tire setting changed for the worst.

He had not nearly packed enuff water or supplies for a change such as that and he would regret it later. The Hills were steep and endless, and the sun was hot and mercilous mankind it even worse on him. This is how the change of setting affected the cyclist.  "	2	2		2																					
6047	3	"The features of setting  really effects the cyclist because of the condition. For example, the weather, it is hot, it will slow the person down. And if it’s perfect that will let the person go at regular speed. And the roads, if the road is bumpy that will slow them down. And if its smooth that will speed them up. See, it really does depend on the condition."	1	1		1																					
6048	3	"The setting affects the  author alot. First he is in a California desert in the middle of June. It is very hot out. This makes the cyclist very tired. There are some cool pines, but they do help much. There is also no where to get water for a very long time. The narration states, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). With no water the cyclist was dehydrated. This hurt his biking skills like balance and led stregth. Finally there was no one around for most of the story. The cyclist did not know how far he had to go until he reached @CAPS1 or water. There was also no one  to help him if he were to have a heat stroke."	1	1		1																					
6049	3	"In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist traveled miles on a bike dealing with the weather in the deserts, little bit of water, and being tired. The cyclist faced many hard times trying to travel on a bicycle from one point to another."	1	1		1																					
6050	3	"The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist’s attitude and adversities. The path of the cyclist is through California deserts, which are dry and hot. This first presents the major conflict of the story, the danger of the cyclist getting heatstake. In the reading, the author says, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” If the setting was in a cooler climate, the author would most likely not drank as often, and would not face dehydration. The trip would not have been as dangerous for the cyclist if the climate was different. Another element of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. In the reading it says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The rough road not only would take a toil on the authors body, but also his mind. While riding, the author thinks, “ I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph” This shows how his attitude is getting less and less optimistic as well as keeping his mind on his thirst. Thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty. The small change in terrain had a large impact on the authors journey. Perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the isolation. Only until the end of the story does the cyclist run into another human. Up until that point, He was all alone, having to deal with his thirst and fatigue on his own. If the setting had been in a more urbanized area, the cyclist could have gotten help from other people, which would have made his ordeal very easy. Also known, that nobody was going to help him played a large role in the mental state of the author. In conclusion, the conflict of this story was set up by the setting. If the setting were not hot, rough, and isolated, the cyclist would have had an easy journey, and the story would not have been as exciting or interesting. A different setting in my opinion would have ruined the story."	3	3		3																					
6071	3	"In 'Rough @CAPS1 Ahead' the features of the setting and the cyclist’s surroundings greatly influence him. Because he is in “the high deserts of California in June,” the climate is hot, dry, and miserable. Another feature of the setting that affects the cyclist, is that he is out in the middle of nowhere. There are no other human beings, cars or buildings for miles. Also, the terrain affects the biker. When the road starts to get bumpy and uneven, it causes him to exhaust his water supply even faster. Overall, the cyclist in this story is greatly affected by his surroundings."	2	2		2																					
6072	3	"In the short story the cyclist was affected by the setting in many ways. The author was running out of water throughout the whole story. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” There was a limited amount of water in the bottles. He had to travel a long distance. “Not two miles into the next section.” He was getting tired quick. Also the terrain was not good. “I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” It get harder and harder to continue his ride."	2	2		2																					
6074	3	"The features in the setting are not very good for the cyclist. He’s in California in June, and it’s very hot. It’s pretty much a desert. When he stops for water, the pump he finds does not have any more water in it except for a few drops. Also, the few drops that he does get taste like battery acid. So this is not very good for the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6084	3	"There are several features that the cyclist encountered, and all of them affected the cyclist. For example, “several rusty bumps,” is a quote of the text explaining that he wasn’t riding on smooth ground he was riding on rough, hard, bumpy ground. Also he had a huge lack of water he was water depleted he couldn’t even go the speed limit, he was going 12 mph, he could have been going 55 mph. “Rough roads ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit,''  this is another quote expressing the dangers in the ride that he was risking. All these things made the cyclist uncomfortable, dehidrated, and very tired."	3	2		3																					
6085	3	"The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was a very large factor of the story that was actually the cause of the protagonist’s problem throughout. First it started off with the large hills he had to ride up, making him work harder and tire himself out quickly. Next the big problem was the heat of June, “ and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because ” The heat was so really bad because it made him hot, thus depleting his water supply [which he needed to survive] and it gave the large, almost inevitable risk of falling from a heatstroke and dying. The heat also made the abandoned Juice Factory all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist. “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” @CAPS1, in the unbearable heat with no water left and @CAPS2 knows how many miles left to cycle, this really made him feel like the sorriest, unluckiest man in the world. The setting overall, seemed almost crafted to make the protagonist not only suffer from the natural elements, but from things that seemed meant purely taunt him for it. "	3	3		3																					
6091	3	"The features in the setting of ""Rough Road ahead"" affect the cyclist. First of all, the weather causes most of his problems. Since the cyclist was biking in a california desert in June the temperature had to be in the @NUM1's. This causes him to become dehydrated, which is evident when he states, ""I had been hitting my water bottles quite regularly"" The heat therefore causes the cyclist to drive excessively and run out of water, also, the objects the cyclsit comes across on his journey affect him. For example, while riding on a rough path, ""a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This saves the biker progress and most likely scared him.

6095	3	"The features of the setting in the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” greatly affected the cyclist. In the beginning of this man’s journey he was confident in his abilities. “I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.”  The cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the setting supported this feeling. ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" @CAPS1, as the setting began to change and his water ran out, the cyclist's attitude changed. He was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June” without much water and begun to feel desperate. As more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair. “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake - it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” He was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this setting he lost hope of surviving. He thought he was going to die of heat stroke, not having any water left, on these short rolling hills and under the extremelyly hot sun. The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting, going from confidence, to desperation and despair, and then to relief, the changes in setting caused his change in attitude throughout this journey.

6103	3	"During the passage “Do not exceed speed limit”, the cyclist endures many hardships. One of those countless hardships was the setting that he was in. while he was lost, thirsty, and exhausted, he remained all the while in “The high deserts of California in June”. This shows that the temperature most of been unbearable. This would cause the cyclist to tire out and dehydrate faster than usual. Also, the surface he was riding on had many steep hills, as it is said when he says “over one long, crippling hill,” This shows that the hills took a lot of energy to get up. And finally, the author says that “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" This shows that if he needed help, there was no one around to lend him a hand. That is how the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way."	2	2		2																					
6107	3	"In the story “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit” there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. The most challenging problem faced  by the author was the lack of water. “ I pumped that handle for several minutes but the water wouldn’t calm down nor I tried a drip or two,it had the flaver of beatterly acid.When @CAPS2 set out for the next train @CAPS2 came to a road that read “Rough road ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. The tarrain got more bumpy & hard to cross. The effected the determination the cyclist had left @CAPS2 the regreted not listening to the old men of didn’t think they knew what they were talking about.

For example, after @NUM1 miles he looked upon the “ramshackeled sched, several rusty bumps and the corral… This sight troubled me. In the desert his water tasted like the flavor of “battery acid.” It also goes on to say that it was a “test for my inner spirit.” It also states that he went along with a few drops of water through the tumbleweeds. This passage shows obstacles he had to go through in which he did and made it with a little confidence. Although his situation was somewhat unbearable he still kept striving on."	2	2		2																					
6126	3	"If I had a choice to ride a bike in California or vermont, it would be a no-brairer to bike in vermont. The temperature in vermont would be much cooler than in California. In the story the cyclist comlains about the ""wide rings of dried sweat"" and the possibility of heatstroke. It is proven that when temperatures rise, you tend to lose more water from your body. Had the cyclist gone to a cooler site at a different time of year he wouldn't have struggled with dehydration on his bike ride. "	1	1		1																					
6132	3	This is how the setting effects the cyclist. One is the hot dry California desert heat. It was making him hot and thirsty which was making him low on water. The hot desert heat had made water a for like a substance which he could not drink from the well. The water bottle only containe a few tentalizing sips which was not enough to quench his thirst. The hot heat that would make birds pick him drys all of those examples make it hard for the reader to take the old timers advice. It made him realice that in time comes wisely and youth can make silly mistakes. The heat had made it only a trip for his inner soul to survive. That is ho the setting effects the cyclest.	3	3		3																					
6136	3	The features affect the cyclist because of how the road is made. If the road is a downhill ride the cyclist might ride faster. The road might be up the hill so he @MONTH1 go slow. There could be a possibility that the road might have bump rocks or grass on it that could be something tough to ride through. So the affect of the cyclist is depending on how the roads are made.	1	1		1																					
6141	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” the setting greatly affects the cyclists. The @LOCATION1 desert climate burrows down upon the cyclist. For example the was further route, he takes is not only @LOCATION1, but also has no place to get water. The heat and lack of water combine for deadly dehydration upon the cyclists. The setting now forces the cyclist to become more determined if he wants to live. He must continue and pray for a town to come up, so he @MONTH1 restock on water and become hydrated once again."	2	2		2																					
6147	3	"The setting in the story affected the cyclist. The setting takes place in June. It is very hot and the cyclist is getting very dehydrated. You can imagine how hot it got when it said, “wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.” It also sounded in the story that it felt like two hundred degrees when the sun was beating down"	2	1		2																					
6152	3	"The setting clearly has a huge effect on the cyclist. The flat roads are easy and smooth to ride on, but as the road changes to short, rolling hills, the biking becomes more difficult. This is supported by the sentence that reads, ""Over are long, crippling hill...” This shows that the hill is a very challenging obstacle. He is also effected by the things that come with the change in terrain. For example, one sentence reads ""...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondbuck-blooked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This stresses how remote the area in which he is biking really is, and shows how it mentally and physically effects his trip.  "	2	2		2																					
6158	3	"In the story, ""Do not exceed posted speed limit, the faetures of the setting effect the cyclist. To keep cool on a hot summer day, is might be neccessary for one to find shade. Just to add to the misfortune of the story. There was no one in eight, not a building, car or structure of any kind."" This factor does not help the cyclist at all, infact, all it does is make the cyclist more  exhausted. Another element in the story that effects the cyclist is the lack of water. Early on in the story the author explains, ""The water bottle contained only a few tatalizing sips."" With more miles to go,the cyclist starts to loose hope of making it to his destination alive. The feature of rolling hills also affects the cyclist. The cyclist is already tired enough, and just to  add to his misfortune, ""flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the hills are short, they still could have put impact on him because of the ropolalive hills. Many features of the story effected the mood of the story."	2	3		3																					
6163	3	The conditions the cyclist has to face are always problems or helpers. Say there is a rocky up-hill part. That will most definuntly slow him down. But if there is a nice smooth downhill part that will speed him up. and take alot of work of pedling off his hands.	1	1		1																					
6164	3	"The cyclist lost hope because he was in the California desserts in June. The cyclist started to lose hope because there was a rusty water pump that pumped out battery-acid tasting water. When he said the sign “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, was very cautious. The cyclist thought for sure that he was going to die out there. The cyclist also felt lonely because in the text it says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. The cyclist was in the California desert and that made him think he was going to die out there."	2	2		2																					
6172	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit.” The cyclist mood seems to change as the road and setting does. The narration states, “ a large high way sign jumped out at me. I read : Rough road ahead : Do not exceed posted speed limit … sometimes life can feel so cruel (Kurmaskie). Slowly as the terrain gets harder and harder the cyclist feels worse and worse. Every time he believes there is a town he gets happy but his dreams are soon crushed. One can see in the picture the hard cycling terrain that can affect the cyclist making him tired due to lack of water and sense of hopelessness he feels as he loses energy and believes he will die."	2	1		2																					
6176	3	"How the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when the old guy had told him do you know where to go? An the other guy was like “ yes sir! I own a very good map” so how did it change for the man that was riding this bike he saw all of those towns an a sign that said Rough Road ahead. That the man would always stick to the future. What had change was he saw all of those buildings, town, an he was going an going. I think he might stick with the future."	1	1		1																					
6182	3	"In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faces many hardships on his way to Yosemite due to the features of the setting. The fact that it was a hot summer’s day contributed to his hardships. With little water, it was easier for him to get dehydrated. In the text, the author writes, “.I could drop from heat stroke, on a gorgeous day in June.” (Kurmaskie, @NUM1). This lets the reader know that the heat of June was very dangerous to the cyclist. There was also nobody around except “Old timers who haven’t left the confines of their perches since water was in offing” (Kurmaskie, @NUM2). The narrator stresses his viewpoint on taking directions from these people since their directions are as poor. It can be inferred that he meant they was obviously out of date when across directions since the ones they gave him were not correct. The cyclist in this story had a rough time getting to his destination due to the setting."	2	3		3																					
6191	3	"Theres many features of the setting that affect the cyclest. His dehidration started with the sun beeting down on him and the thirst for water. He was mainly affected when he was out of water and road by an abbanond welchs grape juice factory. “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head.” Then when he had almost nothing left he spoted a bait shop.” Somehow I climed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” Then, as easily as rounding a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.” @CAPS1 is when he saw “Gary and @CAPS2 Fish camp – If you want bait far the big ones were your best bet thus realcaving his troubles."	2	2		2

To start, it is mentioned that he is in “the high deserts California in June,” @CAPS1 it is implied that the weather is hot causing the author to sweat as he bikes along. Next there is a change in terrain an he soon approaches “rolling hills” which are more difficult to bike on. Finally the author sees a sign that reads “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” and becomes discouraged because his bike is not even capable of reaching the speed limit but he still has to manage getting past the rough road. After passing this road he approaches a picture of a boy drinking juice that is posted on a juice factory. Seeing this sign most likely perpetuates his thirst and leaves him more exhausted and frustrated before. Such features of his surroundings played a large part in the author’s change in mood.

6193	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, is the beating sun. The heat dyhydrates and almost kills him. The rocky road is also a factor. It takes up the time and energy he has to preform. Another key ingreedient of the setting was the desert. There was no one to help him and there wasn't a place to get water. In conclusion the setting was a big factor in the story."	1	1		1																					
6196	3	The ways that can effects the cyclist by the setting of the place are how the road is shaped or the riding up the hills and the roughness of the rode.

6204	3	"In the essay “Do not exceed posted spedd limit” by @PERSON1 many features of the setting effect the cyclist. First, when he arrived at the first “town” and said, “this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time – say, before the last world war.” This deserted ghost town setting was like a joke and had a small effect on the cyclist because it was the beginning of the day and he still had a good water supply. Though when he arrived at the ramshackle shed surrounded by several rusty pumps the effect it had wasn’t so mild. He says, “The sight was troubling.” Then when he got on his hands and knees and started working the pump the situation didn’t get much better. All that came out was a drop or two that tasted like battery acid. Lastly, when he arrived at an abandoned welch’s Grape juice factory after several miles. This had a very wearing effect on him since the water supply was low and he had cycled into disappointment after disappointment. This setting in this essay seemed very abandoned and hopeless. It was only determination that got this cyclist through it."	1	1		1																					
6209	3	"This cyclist had the conditions of the land to deal with, He didn’t have too much water with him and there wasn’t a good source anywhere near him that he could see. He just had to keep going. He also talked about how the road was rough. This was conflicting on how long it took him to get to the next place with water. More over he was in a desert area. The air was dry and hot, the heat was making him sweat and that was leading him to become dehydrated."	2	2		2																					
6211	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One reason the features of the setting affect him is because it is hot outside which makes him need more water. An example of this is “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 example of being hot outside is “A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” "	1	1		1

6225	3	"The cyclist's adventure was very much affected by his setting. It seemed as though the worse his setting became, the worst he personally felt. For example, when he hit the ghost town, he just laughed. Once he got to the fork in the road, he saw less of once exisiting civilization, and he says, ”This sight is troubling,”. Once he moves on, he gets more discouraged by the ""Rough Road Ahead"" sign. It seems as though the more dehydrated he gets, the worse things became for him. The climate in the story also becomes @CAPS1 difficult. The land at first was flat and easy to ride, as it got harder to bike on, the cyclist grew @CAPS1 wary and delievious, but knew he had to keep going. The area in which the cyclist was in, had an enormous effect on him emotionally."	2	3		3																					
6226	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him in a near death situation. He said “sometimes life can be so cruel.” because he was running out of water, running out of strength, and running out of patience. Also a snake ""it really did look like a diamond back,” could have killed him. He was in the desert and anything could happen. The setting of old men who didnt know anything and the heat could have killed the cyclist. The situation would have been different if it were anywhere else."	3	2		3

The cyclist is given almost a hopelessness as well as determination to survive as he runs out of water. For example he says “I was going to lie…slowly gaining elevation while losing hope”. The author makes the trip to a fishing camp and survives.

The cyclist was beginning to lose hope after reading the sign, but he kept going. Furthermore, not only was the land add pressure to the cyclist. So does the heat from the sun.

6244	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. One way it affects the cyclist is because of the weather condition. Being that it is very hot outside the cyclist does not have enough water. Another way it affects the cyclist is because of the condition alongside the road. For example the tumbleweeds and the snakes. Being that its not out most likely the desert is in process of a drought and he gets very dehydrated. I believe these are the reasons because it all makes a lot of sense and affects the cyclist.	1	1		1

The setting controls how long it takes you to getts your destination and how you get there.

Another thing that affected the author was that he felt like giving up because the terrain was too harsh. For instance in the text, “it didn’t really matter I was going to die and the birds will pick me cleary waveng only some experience outdoor gears.” This shows that the author still had to go even when time get tough.

In the story, the cyclist had to travel through desert-like conditions with a limited water supply. The cyclist even mentioned in the story how many hours into the ride the land changed to “ short, rolling hills,” which would have made it harder to pedal, and making him work harder, in the story, he also mention how the sun was beating down on him, and that would alos serve as a factor thout helped deplete his hydration. Through all of the problem the cyclist faced nowever, he managed to stay determined, when other people faced with his problems might not have been able to make it through.

The turain made the story more meaning full in proving that you souldn’t get directions from old guys. "	2	2		2																					
6339	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his travel a lot harder. The weather was very hot making him very thirsty and due to the towns being abandoned, he could not stock up on water. The terrain that he had to cross had many hills and the road was not in good condition. With the heat, lack of water, ghost towns, and tough terrains, made his journey a very hard achievement to overcome. With all these obstacles in his way, he was able to achieve his goal of getting water."	2	2		2																					
6341	3	"In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. Their are many features that affected the cyclist. For example, “The sun was beginning to beat down.” they were starting to get hot, than tired. Than when he came to all the bumps in the road, It was harder to pedal. He was also drinking his bottle of water hard. So that means he's hot getting tired and lost “I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength” That is telling us he’s working too hard, than he’ll be worn out to ride.

If he was riding somewhere else every mile there could be a gas station. Although this cyclist is riding in “No @CAPS2’s @CAPS3”. Lastly the roads in the desert are a lot more dangerous, since people never really drive through, no one really comblains regularly about pot holes and stuff. They are more worried about the cities were many people travel, there is no point to change or fill pot holes where no one really travels."	1	1		1																					
6344	3	"The setting really takes determination away from the cyclist. The were hills that made his ride difficult. It says, “over one long cripping hill, a bulding came into view.” This shows the hills were hard on him because he says they were long and crippling. Another thing in the setting was the building. He was extremely thirsty and becomes he to an abandoned grape juice factory it said, ''by the looks of a had beth a @CAPS1 Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant.” These were two of several examples of the setting affecting the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6350	3	"The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, One way was the weather. In the story it said “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (kermaskie @NUM1). Thats quote said he is in a desert and desert are usally warm. It also said in June and June is usally a hot temp month. The weath affected the cyclist because it was hot and he started to become dehydrated and had little water. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was the souroundings. In the story it said. “There was no one in sight not a building, car or structure of any kind “(kurmaskie). That saying there know one around to help him so if he gets hurt or something.

One example is when the cyclist says “I noticed the terrain changing, Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” This effects the cyclist because it makes him work harded when he is dying of thirst. Especially on a hot summer day. It makes his muscles work harder and use his strength more. In the summer time it is extremely hot. When the cyclist is biking it is very hot, he says”… in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” After this quote he is explaining the difficulty of getting flustrated an there’s No cold water. This affects the cyclist to think about water and not bothering to think about where he is at he could be lost. He didn’t have a good map."	2	2		2																					
6356	3	"SETTING WAS A IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE STORY. I WAS A DESSERT IN A DESSERT THERE IS A LACK OF WATER. AND ME WAS IN A BIKE THAT IS DANGEROUS. BECAUSE YOU ARE USING YOUR FEET TO MOVE WHICH TAKES OUT ENERGY, AND USES WATER FROM YOUR BODY."	1	1		1

As he forms out most of the places he was told about were abandoned ghost towns without a single drop of drinkable water. If he were in a different setting like by a river or spring he would just stop and drink from that. Or even if he was in a more populated, industriated area he could stop in any building and ask for a drink; But he was in the dry, hot, abadond hills of California without any water. Under these conditions he grew tired, thirsty; dehydrated; and desperate for a drink finally he came apon a bait shop that had water there"	2	2		2																					
6373	3	"No water, and no direction effects the cyclist. Water effect cyclist because he said in the essay “I could drop from heatstroke"" (Kurmaskie). also no direction is another big one. It is important because without direction he is going to rideing for a long time. In conclusion water and no direction was the cyclist problem in the story"	2	1		2																					
6376	3	"The cyclist goes through many natural settings that affect him. First of all he rides into barren land. The cyclist portrayed this barrenness by saying “it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This was in response to the first “town” he came across. Next he speaks of a large snake that came close to him which is dangerous, but luckily he manuvers out of its way. But the worse setting the cyclist had to deal with was the lack of water. This is a threat to any living creature. But in the end he found some water and the story ended fine."	2	2		2

Then the story takes an unexpected turn. “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” (@NUM2). After getting lost in a town that seems distant from any living things the author hears people! She is extremely reliefed to have found anyone of help to her. She gets water and is forever greatful. The setting is horrifying to her because you will feel like you cant even if you live there! She felt alone and that she would die. If the setting was in a city surrounded by buildings the author would still feel some security even without water"	3	3		3																					
6390	3	"The cyclist in, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, was affected greatly by the features of the setting. First of all the weather was extremely hot and hot weather just makes you feel exhausted and like you can’t do anything. Also no one is in sight. She is all alone making her feel small and helpless. I know that when there is no one around I get scared. Finally there is no water around. The author is obviously dieing of thirst and with nothing around her she acts even thirstier."	1	2		2																					
6391	3	"The setting effected the cyclist by the rough roads, the cylist having a hard time pedaling over the roads.

6408	3	"In the case of thr cyclist in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit,” the setting has an enormous affecton the biker. Preclaminatly, the weather causes him to feel dehydrated. He says that he “had been nitting my water bottles pretty regularly. “@CAPS1, he tries to get water from the old well, for the demonsrtrating just how much he needed water. The wate in this pump, the owner said, was, “somewhere in the neighbar had of two hundred degrees. If the water has reached such a high temperature, the reader infe that it must be not outside the author implied nthis when he says he is California in June, it is agarsears day, and the sun was beating down. Another aspect of the setting, the lane, dirty, “ghost town” infested land, had a larse affect on the cycle. As he begins to see how hope. He cannot see any signs of madon life; “there was no one is sight, not a building car or structure of any kind. This empty land make the cyclist himself feel empty. Most literally, the fact that the setting was unknown to the cyclist affected his confusion. He didn’t know the best path to his destination and therefore relied on others for aid. Because of this, he ends up lose and acne."	3	3		3																					
6433	3	"The features of the setting made the cyclist more tired and thirsty. The rolling hills where he had to pedal up and down and the desert with no water in sight just dry land. Everything in the setting was increasing the conflict in his story. The old Welch’s Grape Juice Factory,is like drinks are right there but are now gone. If it would have been Yosemite with cool pines and rivers he would’ve felt completely different. No people in sight lacked security and water, also no buildings. The tumble weeds gave you no hope of getting any where and the snakes and vultures just eating you after you died. Everything in the story was the opposite of what he wanted until he got to his last hope the bait shop."	2	1		2																					
6446	3	The hot day in June riding a bike in the desert. The cyclist rode off into the sun on his way to Yosemite National Park. The old men told him where to go on the map even though they had not been through that way in years. When the cyclist started his day off ready to go. He thought he would be able to stop and get water regulary but as he found out he was in the middle of the desert with no water around. The man pushed himself and stopped thinking about water. He even put pebbles in his mouth to suck on so he would be able to keep his mind off water. The man was very smart in this situation and knew what to do. This experence has made him stronger.	2	3		3																					
6455	3	"The features of the setting, or environment, in which the cyclist is in greatly affects him. First of all, after leaving the campground with directions from the older gentlemen, he enters an area that is greatly isolated. In paragraph @NUM1, he wrote, ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time but on @TIME1, it fit the traditonal definition of a ghost town. ""This state of being alone later affected the cyclist because his increasing dehydration was becoming dangerous; if he were to collapse, he would most likely die. This drove the cyclist to continue on in order to survive. Another aspect that affected him was the extremely hot temperature. In paragraph, he implies the weather is hot by telling the reader he is traveling through to California desert in June. The heat gives the cyclist another obstacle to overcome in his struggling to get to the next town for water. Lastly in paragraph @NUM2, he mention the terrain changes to gently rolling hills. This shows the physical and metaphorical obstacles must get over the heat and isolation, but must also find the mental drive and determination to carry on. "	2	3		3																					
6467	3	The features of the cyclist affect him in many ways. One way that the features affected him was that when he ran out of water all the buildings were like a ghost town. He said that there was no one in sight. In the story it says “the bulding abandoned years earlier.” If I was him I would of turned around and went back so I would take the chance of not dieing out in the middle of an abandoned area.	1	1		1																					
6478	3	"The features of the setting including vast emptiness, hills, heat, and no water all create obstacles for the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” @CAPS1 to the vast emptiness of the area in which he was traveling he could not stop somewhere to ask for help or to take a rest. Also there were no other travelers so he could not ask for assistance from them. Another obstacle during his trip are the hills. It takes more energy to pedal up hill so he ends up tiring easily and taking longer than expected. There is also extreme heat which causes him to sweat and even become even more thirsty. So he ends up running out of water. In the story he writes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He is now becoming thirsty and if he doesn’t find water he @MONTH1 dehydrate. He searches for a place to rest where there @MONTH1 be water but he is not able to. All of these obstacles cause the cyclist to become devastated and give up hope but he continues his travel and eventually finds a place to rest.

6480	3	"The features of the setting affect a cyclist in many ways. If you have a bumpy ride, then the cyclist will have a harder time. also, if it is really hilly, then it is harder and will take longer too. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” It will take him longer to reach his destination. animals in the setting can also be effective.” and a ridiculously, large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” animals can get in the way like this snake did for the cyclist. If a squirrel or some kind of animal was to run across the rode right infront of you, it could scare you and you could clash. Sometimes trees make it cooler because you don’t have to sun beating directly down on your back. If there is a fresh water stream you can stop and wash all the sweat off of you and get a drink. The setting in which is cyclist is riding, can help or hurt the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6483	3	"There were a few features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One very important feature is that the cyclist was in the desert. This is demonstrated by the statement “I was travelling through the high deserts of California.” not only was the cyclist in the desert, he was there in June, one of the hottest months of the year. It is demonstrated that he was there in June reading to the statement “I was travelling in June.” @CAPS1 there at that time made dehydration a bigger risk. It was also very hot there. We know this because when he was at the water pump, he stated, “blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” From this, we can affirm that not only was at hot, the water was dirty. The water also “had the flavor of battery acid.” This was bad for the cyclist who was running low on water because he “had been hitting (his) water bottles pretty regularly.” The fact that he had little water left is demonstrated in the statement, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” The cyclist was in a bad situation. These had ganged-up against him in his trip. These features are the desert, the high temperatures, and the blackish water which tasted like battery acid. The fact that he was low on water made it harder to fight these features with water, he would battle the desert, high temperatures, and have no need to pump bad water. Again, the features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the desert, the high temperatures, and the bad water which he could not drink."	3	3		3																					
6485	3	"In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because it made it more difficult for the cyclist to survive and make it through his journey. In the essay, it says, “I arrived at the first “Town”…this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time…but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost @NUM1). In the essay, the cyclist takes directions from a few old men to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist has a limited amount of water, and it was a very humid day for traveling. Because of the humidity, the cyclist nearly ran out of water when he had to cycle up, “short, rolling hills” (@NUM2) in the hot weather. Had the town been thriving, he could have bought more water to make his trip easier to accomplish. Also, if the road in the story would have been flat, he cyclist wouldn’t have gotten as tired as he did and needed more water. It would have been less strainful on the cyclist to pedal on a flat road rather than a hilly road. The challenges facing the cyclist remined me of that of the main character of the movie @PERSON2. In this movie, the main character must make his way through the extreme conditions of the desert, just like the cyclist had to in order to reach his destination. In conclusion, the setting clearly affects the cyclist’s journey in a negative way."	3	3		3

Also it stated,” At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” (Kurmaskie @NUM2). This debris and snake made him stop because he got scared and slowed him down.

6501	3	The setting of the place was “ghost town” as the author said. It was a hot summer day in June so of course the cyclist would be dehydrating.

6512	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is riding in the desert where there is low to rain. This means that he can’t collect any water to drink if he runs out. Also, deserts are hot. The heat will speed up the dehydration process so he will need more water to survive. If he runs out of water, he will die. The cyclist finds a building, but it is abandoned and empty. All these features of the setting affect him. Since he can‘t find water, he has to conserve what he has. Also, the heat is killing him. It doesn’t help to have an abandoned building be the only one he finds. During the whole time that there is death in the air, the desert with nothing growing, no water, the cyclist is thinking about his death. As long as he thinks about his death, there is only more death. As soon as he puts the pebbles in his mouth to stop thinking about death and being thirsty, he sees a bait shop which saves his life.

That problem was an old person told him to go @NUM1 miles to the town and he didn’t trust the guy. Then the biker listened and he went on down the road. He then faced his next problem. The flat road started to get very wary with short high and low hills. These hills reduced his stamina greatly. Then he had to deal with a rocky and bumpy desteart road.

6530	3	"The setting of this story is very rigurous. At the begining of the story the boy was fine. He had a bottle of water with him so that he didn’t get dehydrated. When he was riding he started to feel the sun get higher into the sky, though he could barely feel. It because of the pines that caused the road, and the cool feel of the river. The cyclist got to the second town on his journey and he had been drinking his water all day and was about out. He had found a water pump. He got down on his knees and palled with his night hot all that came but was blackish water. He just feared the water and stated that it tasted like battery acid. He began to ride again. Not two miles up the road the terrain changed. Not only was it rolling hills, it was also getting hotter. He was majorly dehydrated because he was out of water except nor a few “tantalizing sips. Dry sweat circled his shirt and he was afraid he could froz up heatstrokes. Where he was at was in the middle of no where, with no buildings, cars or structures in sight. Over were of the hills he saw a building came in no view. He wiped the sweat off his eyes so makee sure it was not a malinge,” By the lols of it had been a Welch’s @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Factory.” He is a dehydrated and tired that he could see a “Young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.” There is only the problems it is abandoned.

He claims that “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie). This shows that he has been drinking his water too fast due to the heat from being in the desert at summertime. After travelling from a long time with no water he lets out a chuckles thinking of how he shouldn’t have taken the old mens advise. He explains that “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” This is an example of how badly the terrain had effected him. Its gotten to him so much that he applauds himself for having the energy to feel sorry for himself."	2	2		2

Water was a factor because he need cool water to keep him hydrated he came to a shed with pumps after running out of water. He started pumping the water it was hot but he took it he tried to let it cool down but it didn’t. Rolling hills was another a tender to the cyclist hardships because the road started off flat then ended up in hills going up his can strain the leg and makes it harder to keep riding. Another hardship was road condition, it was smooth at frist then it became rough and rocky. Those was some affects the cyclist had to over come"	2	2		2																					
6632	3	Setting  depends on how you can go or move. The town hills helped the cyclist. The up hills didn’t.

They didn’t know where were talking about .How and why did he trust even in the first place.	2	2		2																					
6638	3	"The setting in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was based in the hot, and dry terrain of California. This setting affected the character mood. It did this because some of its included feature can seem as actual metaphorically based moods. An example from the story is, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite...” this quote from the story could suggest the tone and the mood of the scenery which would be calm, and relaxed. So from the scene that is being seen and the mood it has would also give the character its mood."	2	2		2

The rolling hills in the story also affect the cyclist. By cycling towards up and down no often, it secured his journey. It cowed him to the side even longer in getting to a town with water.The deserted knowns in the setting are negatively also affected the narrator. It gave him a hopeless narration because there was no place to stop and depleting his water supply."	2	3		3

In the story the cyclist is faced with the mental and physical journey he takes while riding his bike. Being unware of where he is on his journey the setting begins to really affect him. For example as he keeps making his journey he is affected by the old towns and desert places he even says that ""The sight was troubling."" As he continues to California in June the heat and the long journey really began to affect him both mentally and physically. For example he says, ""I got down my hands and knew working the hands of the rusted water pump with all my strength."" The quote shows because he is biking so long is looking water and there is not a town is sight he becomes weak and although he is at terminated to make it through this journey he is becoming more hopeless and sorry for himself because of the setting he is placed in.

In the story the setting plays a big party in the cyclist's will to ride to the next town. First the cyclist asks directions from a guy that never left his house in decades this creates, doubt. Also in the story it says “Tumbleweeds cross my path” this makes the cyclists feel lost. Finally it say the “water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This makes the cyclist thirsty and tired. The features definatly have an effect on the cyclists."	2	2		2

For example the text states “No a better, piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be never.

6696	3	"It can’t be known as, ""easy"" to ride through a desert on a bike. Adding rough pavement, rusty water pumps, and not so friendly animals adds to the discomfort as well. The cyclist in this story encountered all these things, making his supposedly pleasurable ride turn to a semi brutal experience “it got down on my hands and knee, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. Alike substance ooed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees, “This quote shows how the conditions of his water supply where, which eventually lead him to dehydration. It lead: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT @CAPS1 SPEED LIMIT.”This quote also shows how the riding conditions were making the  cyclist have a harder time keeping speed. “at some point tumberweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-beaked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” @CAPS2, this quote show of some of the dangers the  cyclist encountered. If  these features did not appear, then maybe the story would be describing a nice bike ride, but once you read about them, it becomes more of a disaster."	3	3		3

He decides to continue on his treck reaching the next ghost from at this time he is becoming dehedrated due to his lack of water supply He decides to keep persueing his good and figures there must be water up ahead in the next town.

The author of the essay used phrases such as ‘the sun was beating down” and “high deserts of California in June” to emphasize the extreme heat that caused the cyclist extreme thirst and heat exhaustion. The essay also says “short rolling hills”, “tumbleweeds” and “long, crippling hill” to describe the difficult terrain the cyclist faced that caused him to be tired and slower.  Finally, the cyclist is faced with a “rediculously large snake” and plants and weeds which get in his way and force him to slow down."	2	2		2

In this story the description was like a scorching path of nothingness for about as far for human eyes could see. In paragraph @NUM1 the text says “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could die from heatstroke.” is empressed how the climate felt.

6727	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” the setting is able to affect the cyclists emotions and moods in both positive and negative ways. As the author travels through the desert he is already upset because it is so hot and water is scarce showing how the terrain is a negative influence. Another example would be when the author first sees the old water pump and he is relieved showing positive influence but the pump oozes a shine like substance he referrs to as tasting like “battery acid” changing his mood for the worst. Finally, the pebbles he puts in his math show is desperation and willingness to try anything to survive show a new posotive outlook on the desert until a pump “lodges are in his thro at” making yet another negative influence. All of these feature lead him on his way to “Gary and will fish camp” and grounded an extra boost on his journey through the desert."	3	3		3																					
6736	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. The fact that he was in the California desert and the heat affected him because he had limited water and was using his energy riding the bike. The “towns” he came across also made an impact on him because of the fact that he couldn’t get more water or a place to rest. “I was doing a water depleating @NUM1 sometimes life can feel so cruel”.

6763	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. When she was riding it was very hot this caused the cyclist to lose energy and dehydrate. Also when the cyclist went through a terrain change. The road changed into rolling hills. This caused the cyclist to become tired because after riding up and down your body gets tired. Also being as the weather was so hot this caused the cyclist to drink a lot of water. Eventually she ran out and then got dehydrated. This whole situation implied to stick to your original plan. If the cyclist would have done that she wouldn’t have had to go through the hardships.	2	2		2

He’s really not happy about listening to them and not following his map. When he gets to the fishing place he is greatful for the water in the sink and for the rest and when the old man offers to give directions to Yosemite he thinks he will just use his map.

6798	3	"The features of the surrounding landscape affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. First, the sun constantly beating down on the cyclist causes his or her body to sweat more, which makes one’s body use more energy. The sun rays also add to the heat the cyclist feels. Also, the rough road forces the cyclist to pedal very hard, which drains him or her of even more energy. For example, when the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” reached the rough roads, he had to pedal harder, which made him sweat more, and caused his amount of energy to decrease. Finally, the lack of civilization can make a cyclist feel hopeless, which is how the cyclist in the essay felt when he had no water or could see no nearby town. This can affect the cyclist’s will to keep pedaling, and if they have no determination, the cyclist will not go anywhere. The features of the setting can physically exhaust and mentally strain the cyclist, which makes it harder for him or her to keep going"	3	2		3

This exert from the test supports my previous statement about how it’s hot because the speaker tells us how he’s sweating and that he might be seeing a mirage. “There was no one insight not a building, car, or any structure of any kind” (@NUM2.). This shows that there is no one around to help him if he falls down from a heat stroke or anything like that. So the setting is affecting the cyclists endurance."	2	2		2																					
6815	3	"The settings of your environment always seem to affect your mood. Take for instance the cycler. In the beginning he had a positive attitude but once he arrived at the first town his attitude started to go down from there. He explains describes the town as maybe at one point being a thriving spot, “but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” Ghost towns come across very old, run down and dull. That affected the cyclist because by it not being like the old men said he was becoming doubtful, which in turn doesn’t give you the same motivation as when he started. Then when he get to what is suppose to be water and a, “tar like substance oozed out.” That makes him nevers and mad because he isn’t sure he will make it. But his attitude changes as soon as he sees the store. The setting becomes positive and so does he. So, the setting does effect the cyclists mood and attitude."	2	2		2

This heat made it had for the cyclist to keep going, with despair the author says, ”I was going to die and the birds world pick me clean.” @CAPS1 feature of the setting was the desolet towns that didn’t contain any water. This lack of the water made it horrible for him to continue on. The thirst was so bad that he had to put pebbles in his mouth to sucking on stones helps take your and off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulates. @CAPS1 features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the abandoned Welch’s Grape factory. This  factory gave the cyclist false hope because it would have been so great to have some grape juice during his thirst stricken state.

She is also thinking beyond that by just laughing at herself and trying to conserve every bit of energy she possibly can. As a result, the affect from the setting on the cyclist is that lack of water has given her humor and courage to keep going, to get to her final destination point."	3	2		3

The cyclist had problems because of the weather and on the shortness of water. Since there was a shortness of water he had to conserve it which slowed him down because he couldn’t ride as much. Although there was a cool wind and a river from Yosemite he had to pass quickly down the hill so he had even more problems.

You can’t go bike riding in snow because there is no way that the tires will move in the snow. You can’t go in rain or hail because the roads get slippery and you could getin a accident that could injure or kill you. If it is sunny outside you be able to ride freely on dry roads with a little breeze to go through your hair and you could be refreshed. That is why I believe it is important for the setting to be just right for a bike ride."	1	1		1

There was eventually nothing. The scenery was putting down his hope of ever getting out of the desert. For example: In paragraph @NUM2 it states, “a large highway sign jumped out of me. It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” He realized this was going to be hard. He had to travel in bumpy roads and pass snakes without getting bit. The scenery created a sense of hopeless because it was abandoned. When he saw the bait shop, his spirits lifted and he was now hopeful and relieved."	3	2		3

Firstly, the cyclist had been pedaling through the “high deserts of California”, making a hint that the temperature was hot and dry, and therefore he must’ve been getting thirsty regularly and exhausted from the sun beating down on him. Second, he began to ride through hills, and as common sense would be used, hills are much harder to ride on a bicycle especially up hill, and it wears you down. These hills, along with a lack of water must’ve tired him out and given him extreme difficulty to make it without much water.

Since nothing is around him there is no where for him to get water adding to the affect of dehydration making him more thiristy. The rider says “One ran shacle shed, sevral rusty pumps, and the corral that couldn’t hold the lamestmal egreeted me. ''This statement from the author support the factt that nothing is around.

6883	3	Setting very much affects the cyclist and now he feels. If he was in a bad setting then he would most likely be in a bad mood. Mood is highly affected by the general setting. In the essay “rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit” the cyclist feels very confiedent of himself and the setting helps to boost that confiedence and andorence.	1	1		1																					
6888	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because where he is riding it is very dry and hot. He can deal with the heat with his good water supply, but when it runs out he begins to get disoriented. For example in the text he writes “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirrage,” That statement shows that the cyclist was hot, and the images around him making him feel more hot than what he is, and his lack of water made him almost belive that he was imagining seeing a building. Another example is “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hang my head.” This quote shows that the cyclist is in complete despair as he looks at the photo and hangs his head. This shows that the cyclist was constantly being reminded how hot and thirsty he was everywhere he would  go and he couldn't get a drink. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6895	3	"In the story the setting plays a big role in effecting the cyclist. The terrain was very hard at times such a big hills and windy torns. Also, there was no one around. no houses, buildings or people which made him fell alone and life he was going to die. The author describes the terrain in one part of the story “Over onelong, crippling hill a building came into view! This quote shows how the hills in the seting were very big and hard to get over. It also shows the significance of a single building and how excited he was to see it. In the story the author described many features from the setting which all greatly effected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
6897	3	"The dessert environment had huge effects on the cyclist. He had been drinking his water regularly and would be running out. Not realizing, their would be no refills because the pump was only giving “ tarlike substance” said the text. With the lack of water dehydration was beginning to hit the poor man. An effect of dehydration is poor balance that would have been useful to pass the “ ridiculously large snake” he had seen. A finale effect would be mirages that could loose your judgement. This man double checked his eyes, when coming in view of a building, by “[wipping] the sweat from (his) eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage,” Through all the toughest desser obsticles the character was able to take the short cut and survive heat, dehydration, and animals of the dessert."	2	2		2																					
6903	3	"On the cyclists rideto Yosemite National Park he encouters a lot of hardships due to the setting hes around and the advice given by oldmen. The cyclist riding his bike in the middle of June in the deserts of california isnt good to begin with adding to cyclist dehydration state. He first come to encouters ''one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn`t hold in the lament mule'' By that description oF his lecatracy it seems as if he might be in ghost town by himself almost could strand him. He described the terrain with “short, rolling hils.'' and ''over one long, crippling hill.'' This shows some of the obstacle that he had to go through in a bike, just to get to Yosemite National Park. He @CAPS1 realized once he encounterd these Features oF the terrain that he was oFF track and needed to find help. After his survival of his surroundings For as long as he could go, @CAPS1 gets help at a real camp. That is how the settings of the story play role in the cyclist epidemic."	2	2		2																					
6911	3	"The setting of this story affects the cyclist alot. I think the setting was supposed to be most like a run-down out of dated town which didnt help him when he was lost. The town is out of date and hot. Which bring another problem, the cyclist was dehydrating because he didnt have enough water. He would hilusinate and see things that werent there. He become very tired in the hot sun. So the setttling in this short stories effected the cyclist in many ways."	1	1		1																					
6913	3	"The cyclist had a hard trail to bike in order to get to @LOCATION1. It is easy to bike if you are on flat smoot terrain, when you get to rolling hills, it makes it a lot tougher. The biker said “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. It was also very hot. he was sweating and getting dehydrated, “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind of thirst.” he had eighteen miles to next town without much water. The first deserted town didn’t have any drinkable water. It was very hard to bike in these conditions, and is important to always be prepared and know were you are going."	2	2		2																					
6915	3	In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1” the imagery is what sets the cyclist back. The scorching dessert and plant life gives him a sense of seclusion and scares him. Because the cyclist is in the  dessert he keeps on worrying about his water and heatstroke where as if he where in a rain forest he wouldn’t worry about water or heat. I think he siked himself out just by taking in his sorroundings. If the cyclist would have pictured water all around him and arctic like temperatures I think he wouldn’t have been so worried. What’s interesting about this story is that if he would have gotten himself prepared mentally for the conditions he wouldn’t have struggled so much at the end. “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back blocking the majority the pavement in front of me.”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). If the cyclist word of concentrated more on the task at hand and less on what was going on around him I think he would of succeeded without as much stress.  	2	3		3

He is riding on the road; hopelssly hoping for some form of lif. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. “The author is trying to be positive but it’s hard, because all this scenery is doing is bringing his hopes down. How would you like it if you were riding a bike and had no water in the middle of a desert. Now, if the setting had been a nice, green forest, he wouldn’t be that worried, there’s water and shade.

6926	3	"”Do not Exceed the posted speed limit” tells a story of learning and determination, as one cyclist bikes through the deserts of California,  encountering obstacles such as snakes and a lack of water along the way.  The descriptive features of the setting greatly affect the protagonist along his journey. The essay takes place in the early summer. As the cyclist prepares to retire for the day, he takes particular note of “the serenity of an early summer evening,” and ends the day feeling calm. The next morning he is excited and rejuvenated, ready to bike again. The heat rises as the day goes on, and by mid-day the cyclist begins to worry about his water supply. He boldly continues forth reaching new terrain, rolling hills. Here he begins to lose hope, and is disappointed when he seem the “town” he hoped to find is an abandoned juice factory. The cyclist thinks he is going to die due to the heat and lack of hydration, but gathers his strength to turn the final bend, and reaches a bait shop where he can stop and get water, he is finally relieved. In conclusion, as the cyclist continues his journey through the California desert, the change in both weather one terrain coincide and affect the cyclist’s change in physical and mental strength to continue traveling."	3	3		3

6937	3	"The setting in the story affects the main character greatly because of the heat. The main charater is biking throug a desert in the summer with little water. The heat of the setting provides a problem because the main character is at risk of dehydration and heatstroke. The main character knows that if he passes out in the barren desert he will sarley die. The main character says, “The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” The main character is faced with a problem of man versus nature and the heat is winning. Heat and dehydration sap the main characters energy while he is biking through a desert, desperately trying to make it to the next town. In summary, the main characters biggest problem is the heat of the setting."	2	2		2																					
6939	3	"All the feature of the area have a have a big affect on the cyclist. It is a hot June morning, and he is on his bike, pedaling hard, going many miles. He can't find any water, because all the towns along the road are deserted. He is getting dehydrated, and losing strerigth. It seems like he might have collapsed it he hadn't thought he was going to @CAPS1, and if he hadn't gotten some water at that store. All in all, the setting seems to have the intention of king him."	2	2		2																					
6944	3	"In the story “Rough Road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting seem negative to the cyclist. The setting seems to start worrying the cyclist two miles after he said that he could make the next @NUM1 miles easily. For example the cyclist says “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, “the cyclist seems worried at that point that things aern’t going to be as easy as they seemed they were going to be. From that point on the setting seemed to get worse for the cyclist later on the cyclist ends up saying “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” That was when the cyclist began to notice his fear of dehydration. The cyclist ended up making it and he realized what a big effect nature can have on you."	2	3		3																					
6952	3	"At times when the features of the setting are bad it can have a great impact on the cyclist. For one if it’s too hot the cyclist is going to need plenty of water if he/she does'nt want to be dehydrated. There are also the dangers of heat strokes and deadly snakes, cyclist might want to avoid that. When your a cyclist times can be hard just prepared for the long run."	1	1		1																					
6959	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Three features I found were the lack of the water, the heat and the conditions and limits of the road. The lack of water really affected the cyclist. When he was died tried he/she didn’t have anything to drink. The essay stated how would say she/he would save the water til the end. He /she was so tired so the lack of water really affect him/her. The conditions he/she was in really affected the cyclist also. From the beginning he/she was told the wrong directions. That was the reason why he/she was lost the entire time. Finally the limits of the road affected the cyclist. Hills and different grounds did not help the cyclist. In conclusion, the cyclist had many factors affecting him such as lack of water, limits of the road and his/her conditions."	2	2		2																					
6961	3	"In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist takes advice from some old guys and ends up wishing he never did. He is on an empty road, flat and dry. He ends up drinking all of the water he has, and needing to stop for some more.” I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” He stopped to get more water, but once, all that came out was some tar like stuff, and then he couldn’t find another place for quite a white. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills and he came to a sigh that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit”, and passed tumble weeds and a large snake. All of these things impacted his journey with fear, caution, etc. When he finally reached a place to get a drink, he was finally satisfied. Because it was hot, and empty, he was more thirsty so therefore the setting affected the cyclist."	2	3		3																					
6969	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. Fem the ghost town to the bait shop, it was all a challenge for him. A misleading challenge , But a challenge . In the desert is were water grew short and he tried everything to push himself. From staring at the horizon to get to a place to another from sucking on pebble stone to not focus on water. And when he arrive at the bait shop. A sense of relief came to him, like that shop was his safe haven. But yet he would never get directions from any old-timer again. Lack was not a factor in this story. Rather it was drive and overal climate of the story. When it was two –hundred degrees left, and no water left, he pushed himself to the light. And also when he saw a building he was determined to get to it."	2	2		2																					
6970	3	"The cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was in Lodi, California when he decided to ask for directions from old codgers so that he could take a short cut. He followed their directions and little did he know that he should have stuck to his original directions. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The cyclist became very hot and thirsty from traveling in the desert. It says in the text “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid” This shows that he had no water left to kept him dehydrated throughout his travel. Also in the text it says “with what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill” this shows that he had no energy left."	2	2		2																					
6979	3	"In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” many features of the setting affected the cyclist. And these setting could be easily formed in the middle part of the essay. And these settings caused the cyclist exsaused on his journey. First, the cyclist noticed a rode change from flat to short, rolling hills. He had to spend more energy to go up the hills which caused him to loss a certain amount of  energy. Then, his lack of water caused him a dehydrated state. He could loss an another large amount of energy by this and out of this stage, he mostly needs someone to support him or be on his side, but he was riding alone, there was no one on sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. This might cause his emotion break down to make his energy to loss. Overall, the cyclist suffered a loss of energy on his journey. And was unable to have a supporter to help"	2	3		3																					
6997	3	"Setting plays a crucial part in the cyclist’s mood and energy. For example, in a cool @DATE1 day riding gently downhill, the rider is happy and energetic. However, “traveling through the high deserts of California in June is not the best environment for laughs and ease. The cyclist in the story was hot exhausted, and hydrated. He thought, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Where the cyclist rides can have a huge effect on the cyclist himself."	2	2		2

In the story the cyclist is riding a bike for miles. “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.... in my dehydrated state.” This quote only lists a few of his problems. He had tumbleweed, a snake and he was dehydrated. He had to stick pebbles in his mouth because he heard that they take away your dehydration. All through out the story he ran into many problems or obstacles but overcame them very well."	2	2		2																					
7003	3	"The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. Some of these features include:- the heat, dangerous animals, not a lot of civilization, and the terrain. In the essay, each of these features were spoke of and they all affected the cyclist in a negative way. For example, when the cyclist headed from the intense heat, he needed to find a town. The first “town” he found he described as a “ghost town” It took a while to find another town and he had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly and [he] was travelling through the high deserts of California in June so he was getting really dehydrated and ready to collapse. The flat road [being] replaced by short, rolling hills wasn’t helping either.

7014	3	"The setting of “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was very hot deserts. On a bike ride there are not many places to stop for food or water. On a bike ride you cant bring a lot of louage with you. Only important materials and a big enough jug of water. An example from the text to show how bad it was out there. “I got down on my hands, and knees, working,the handle of the rusted pump with all my strength. He was so thirst and tired he didn’t know how else to get some water"	1	1		1																					
7023	3	In the poem “Do not exceed speed limit” the setting is described as very rough and dry. The man on the bike says he was running low on water. At one point he says “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridi culously large shake” This makes the setting sound dry and empty with a harmful snake around. this  man also said about a sign which read “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” this also made it hard for the man to ride. These are the settings that affected the biker in the story.	1	1		1																					
7035	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First the climate affected him the most thats so because he became to hot, drank a lot, and then became dehydrated. So he had no energy because of dehydration. Another one is the built of the road. That’s so because it was rocky bumpy, winding, hills with being dehydrated the road was very tempting to just give up and die. Then the heat got him because there was no shade, no water left, and the sun just beating down on him."	2	2		2																					
7036	3	"During the cyclist trail there are many factors that play out to be disadvantages to him/her. There are rough roads, bad water pump, abandoned battling plant, and the long lasting truth that it wasn’t even his path. All of these factors create something new in the cyclist. As the cyclist recover the first town and realizes it is decreased he is initially amused. He then pedals on, but realizes his water is running low. Then , what is originally a sign of hope because another let down. A water pump found just in time, but the water is no longer any determination they reach “rough roads” creating, once again, a more painful journey. Finally, the cyclist sees a building in the distance, but again, deserted. The only goodness as the poor cyclist is when they came along a bait “tar, some sign of civilization that keeps him alive. Hope after hope arises to the end in turmoil upon turmoil. These encounters would cause oneself to become persimistic on even a task, but he sought through. These encounters create an interesting meal. Every time you catch word on hope you become entitled to what could happen next and then feel sorry for the cyclist after having hope on multiple occasions. The steady and salidrising the plot keeps the reader entitled wanting more."	3	3		3																					
7043	3	"The setting of the story had affected the bike rider in many way. It was hot when he was riding so he was thirsty. For example, “The sun was beginning to heat down” (pg @NUM1). So the sun is very exhusting and made him to start dehydrating. Another example is a traveling through the desert of California in June” (pg @NUM2). California is a relatively hot state and June is one of it’s warmer months. The terrain didn’t favor in the riders either “Flat road had turned into, short rolling hills “(pg @NUM2). Short rolling hills are harder on a bikers body than flat terrain. This is how the setting affected the rider."	2	2		2																					
7044	3	"The setting affected the cyclist because it was in June and it was starting to get hot. In the book, it said he was going through the desert. Also, the author did not have enough water to survive in the desert while the sun was beaming on him."	1	1		1																					
7050	3	"Throughout his journey, the protagonist in the story encounters obstacles in the setting. First off, he is cycling in the hot, dry, desert. There is no civilization or natural water source, so he faces dehydration. Additionally, the terrain he was riding on proved difficult. He encountered rolling hills that took a lot of energy to ride up. There were even signs for “rough road ahead,” @CAPS1 obstacle was a mental obstacle. He came across an abandoned juice factory when he needed an occupied building. These were ironic and mentally frustating. The cyclist must have lost hope in @CAPS2 civilization after he found @NUM1 abandoned examples of civilization. This discouragement must have made his journey more mentally challenging."	3	3		3																					
7057	3	"The setting of the story affected the cyclist because it kept him going because he was all alone and had no help. First, just the fact that he was by himself kept his determination high. If he would have had a partner they could have stopped and took a break or shared the water. Next, the fact that there were no buildings, houses or anything in sight affected him.  He got a bolt of strength just from seeing a building ahead. If there had been building he could have stopped and asked for more water and rested. The fact that he was in a desert in California in the middle of June really affected him. He had no determination there because there was nothing he could do to better the situation in his cause. He even at one point felt that he might die. In conclusion the setting really affected the cyclist because it determined his endurance and will power."	2	2		2

On the posts “Do not exceed posted speed limit “is after “wide rings of dried sweat clinched my thirst, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June”. This shows that he is dehydrated from the sun which is a feature of the setting. “a tarlike distance surged out, followed by cockish water feeling somelane in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” Cyclist know that there is no water in this place which is another feature of the setting which affects the cyclist.

7082	3	"The cyclist is riding through the high deserts in California. In this environment everything looks the same for miles. The cyclist is dehydrated and is getting worse because he has no protection from the sun. It is hard for the cyclist to keep in good spirits because he is not even coming across any towns or sources of water. The cyclist says “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This made the cyclist doubt the old timers directions. In the wide open desert, the cyclist was only coming across something after at least twenty miles. The heat, lack of water, and lack of civilization made the cyclist think he was “going to die and the birds would pick [him] clean. When the cyclist spots the abandoned Welch’s factory, the cyclist says they used what seemed to be their last bit of energy. The conditions affected the cyclist"	3	2		3

There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. With any luck, I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. Rough road ahead if he didn’t take the old mans advice, he would have enjoyed his bike ride he needed a new map."	3	2		3																					
7088	3	"The features in the story affect the cyclist by not having anything to drink. The person was going to a place far away with out any food or water for miles. He could have died. There is anther feature the effects the cyclist, and that is no one is around for miles. If he died out there, no one would no know for days. I know this because in the story he said “ There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. ''That says it all, the last feature is that it was hot. I know this because it says ''I was travelling through high deserts of California in June.'' It is hot is June, and it is even hotter in California."	2	2		2																					
7094	3	"The biker has many features in his story. For example he has discriptive words that put pictures into my head. For example “One long, crippling hill” I can picture it in my head. “There was no one in sight.” All of these parts of the story put pictures in my head. Thats a good thing, for example you want the reader to understand it, and by having discribing words help."	1	1		1																					
7100	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is in the desert it is in the summer. It affect the cyclist because he is riding a bike. For exsempl in the story he is running out of water. He is starting to git dehyjradid.	1	1		1																					
7102	3	"After sometime into his trip he mentioned “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I believe that this setting had gotten him determined to keep on pedaling so he could live. But then he started to think he might die, but he wasnt sad or upset, he was happy. He had sort of chuckled to himself, because of the fact that he might die because he listend to some old men. In my opinion I think he was having the time of his life peddeling through this setting of California."	1	1		1																					
7103	3	"Where cyclist was gave him more disadvantages, then advantages. The advantages were their were hills to go down. Disadvantages hills to go up, water running out when he is in the middle of no where, very hot out, and is lost in the desert, doesn’t have much hope until he see's the factory. Biggest disadvantage is he is on a bike, and not in a car. So he has no @CAPS1 and has to pedel to keep going. But being in the desert on a bike with no water, and you are last, is quite bad. He is very lucky that he made it up the hill or else he would’ve died out there. And he thought he was seeing things good thing he checked it out. I think for future refrence ride in a car, don’t use a bike in the desert, its not to smart."	1	2		2																					
7105	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in different ways The woman who had listen to the older men to get where she was going had made her run out water and almost died of thirst. As she was going to this place she had seen a snake “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondback” (@NUM1). She started to see things that wasn’t there."	1	1		1																					
7107	3	"The features of the barren desert path make the cyclist quite nervous, but they also make him determined to escape them. He passes “ghost towns,” “abandoned buildings,” and diamondback snakes. These are images traditionally associated with being lost in the deserts, and would be enough to instill fear in most anyone travelling alone. The author even remarks that sadists are probably finding his story pleasing. He often mentions fears of “dropping” dead, being eaten by vultures, and, at one point, even wishing death upon himself via choking albeit jokingly. And yet he was determined to live. In spite of the odds stacked against him, he moved on, even after losing “what (he) believed to be (his) lost burst energy."" He even maintains a sense of humor throughout, writing of a diary entry that would be left behind that remarks on the wisdom of old men. In the end, when he finds a place to rest, he turns it all into a lesson he’ll surely abide by: follow the map!"	3	3		3

When the cyclist came to a sign in the road warning him about the road a hed he began to get depressed, “I was sad”. Finally when he reached @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 Fish Camp he was thankful and wanted to show his gratitude. The setting can affect a cyclist by his mood at first the cyclist is determined but as the setting gets worse his mood and hopes go down the drain.

When the cyclist finds hope, “And drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.” The cyclist was astonished of what he had stumbled onto and appreciated that he was still alive.

I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly “(kurmaskie @NUM2). He is saying that as the things around him began to change the more he got scared. And he kept drinking a lot of water just to bring down his fear. Another example is after he had left the sign that told him not to pass. He says “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (kurmaskie @NUM3). This is also an example of fear that started over coming him, when he saw even more changes. He wasn’t going to stop because of the road changes and the fact that his water was almost gone he still had the courage to go further.

The terrain was also not very ideal for a cyclist on a hot @DATE1. “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The cyclist was tired and the hills were making it worse. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” The cyclist was running out of water quickly and there was nowhere close to get more.

The cycllist being exauhsted and dehydrated,or tired and thirsty, was beging to wear as the setting went from being flat to many ups and downs. The cyclist exlained the change by saying, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills”(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist’s idea presented here is that he was to find new challenges when riding the hill of this californian desert rollar coaster. His water supply was thinning from the heat and the hills were tiring him beyond reason. All this cyclist could hope for was the blessing of a water refill and the shade of a puffy cloud."	2	2		2

As he got to the second stop his lack of water began to set in, “I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water with all my strength. This shows he will work hard and is in need of water. As the cyclist past another place with no hope of water he placed stones in his mouth because he once heard it helped get your mind off thirst when he had just about lost hope from travelling through the hot @CAPS1 desert with no water he found one lost drive in him when he saw a store with water. Though this was a hot harsh setting it created inspiration for him to keep going and push through the hard times and survive."	3	2		3																					
7211	3	"The features of the setting had greatly impacted the cyclist. The heat, animals, and terrain had slowed him down throught his journey. The heat had slowed him down because he didn’t have enough water to keep his boby moving normaly, and he said he had slowed him down because he had to sneak around it so it wouldn’t bite him.

When she entered the first town, “this sight was troubling”. I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, “she was beginning to get worried/ run out of water, the next town was “only eighteen miles down the road."" He was now at the dehightrated state. “ The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" Then he saw a building, but it was no longer open, so he got back on his bike, but his thoughts had changed he was now upset and expecting to die. He then saw a store, “Gary and wilbers fish camp”.

I could drop from a heatstroke.“ This statement clearly says that where the cyclist was riding, water was very hard to find and scare. He is talking about how he will die if he doesn’t get water. Another example is that there are no buildings around and is deserted with no one around and many hills and roads.

""I would come to along this breeze jaunt."" The word breezy shows that the cyclist can enjoy riding the bike because there is a breeze. Another feature of the setting is very old and dirty. The water that the cyclist is drinking is drying his mouth out even more. “A tar-like substance oozed out followed by brackish water feeling.” This shows the dirtyness of the water. Also this setting shows the cyclist had to use all he had just to survive.

Alone with this, the cyclist had to work much harder because the man noticed, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This setting is a major setback to the cyclist’s journy, and required him to persevere. In my life there have been numerous obstacles which I have had to persevere through. One of which had been when I was out camping, and suddenly, as in the essay, the setting changed, and a storm came. Though the other campers and I did what we needed to to make the best outof it.

He finds himself in the California desert without water, he lets this go to his head. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” That line was from the last page of the story. The biker was taking an unfamiliar route and he let himself believe he would die. He knew he was in the desert without water the setting makes him nervous because he was in a desert. He wouldn’t have been nearly as nervous if he was in a forest where there are streams. He lets the desert and the heat convince that he is going to die. By coming across ghost towns he believes he will never see anothe person again, he gets oledrar because of where he is. He thinks the heat will kill him.

However, once he notice that everything is not has the men said, he seems to grow a little angry and upset, @CAPS2 like the land seemed to reflect this soon he found himself in a bumby and unpleasant road. The setting also seemed to give the man more obstacles to overcome on adventure” tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the movement in front as me.” The land seemed to be leasing and tormenting him, when he started to figure out that listening to the old men was a mistake.

This part of terrain shows its effect. When he becomes very dehydrated, “in my dehydrated state“ (kurmaskie @NUM1). Another part of the setting that effected the cyclist was when he arrived at the juice factory and it was closed which depressed him."	2	2		2

""He rode into the morning with strong legs,” Then he got to the first stop. It looked like a buzzing town at one time, but now a ghost town. So he kept on with plenty of water and thought he could make it to the next stop. The next stop was an old abandoned gas station where the only water was @NUM1. He was hitting the water pretty regular and the hot sun was beating down on him. The next terrain changed he thought he would die & have the vultures pick his bones because he took advice from old timers, then became to his next stop which seemed to be an old welch’s grape juice factory. He thought he would die of thirst but he kept on with little water a hot sun. next the hills came & he paced himself a little time, then he finally came to a modern looking place with cool running water with an old man who gave him directions that he gladly took. After that he been through asuring himself he would die he was relieved to see the old man’s there he would forever on listen to their advice because he made it."	1	1		1																					
7409	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because someone travelling a good distance in California during June will be hot. If the cyclist doesn’t have enough water to supply himself for if he gets lost then the features of the setting are very crucial. Not having enough water can cause someone to dehydrate, which does happen to the cyclist in the essay. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. “This statement proves that the cyclist wasn’t a good state to be lost when the sun is blazing down on him. Also, when you are dehydrated and tired you @MONTH1 start to see things that aren’t there, but you want to see those things. “ I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. “It was a good decision that the cyclist didn’t get his hopes up about a building that might not be there overall, features of a setting for a cyclist can cause anything to happen, so be careful."	2	2		2																					
7416	3	"During this bikers adventure heat and lack of water affect him. In this short story when the cyclist feels lost he says “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” This suggests that the rider was faced with the extreme heat of the desert during his ride. He also says “The water bottles contained only a few tantilizing sips.” This quote shows that not only was he faced with the heat, but also with lack of water. These facts and quotes show the clear threats this biker faced on his long bike-ride."	2	2		2

For example, the cyclist was pedaling and pedaling with nothing in sight. In twenty miles he saw camp ?? a ?? that he was thirsty and had holes. When he pumped the water, no  come out. These part of the setting gave the cyclist a bad affect. The cyclist gave ""teaches life can be so cruel"" He obviously had a bad effect if he thought life was being cruel At some point in the story the setting be a good affect on the reader. He is able to die of thirst when he sees a bait shop. This puts the cyclist in a good mood because he said “my troubles thirst and feels he all behind me” different settings in the story gave the author a different affect. "	2	3		3

7434	3	"Well the features were rough desert like features. For a cyclist this terrain is difficult. For example the lack of water, and the battery acid flavor. These affected the cyclist in a major way."	1	1		1																					
7440	3	"Hot, @CAPS1, @CAPS2-all are the features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, the hot days with not a lot of water to drink. He will get dehydrated. Also, there is no one around to help him if he gets lost. Joe Kurmaskie explains “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structur of any kind. Finally the creature was a large snake that came along on road. So he had to move around it."	2	2		2																					
7447	3	"The features of the land affect the cyclist in the many ways. For example, the first two buildings that he came to were abandond so he could not get any food or water. Also, he noticed that the terrain was changing from flat to rolling hills and this will put more strain on his legs. Finally, the land was hot and dry wich was making him dehidrated. This is how the features of the land affected the cyclist. "	1	1		1																					
7452	3	"The setting affects the cyclist because it is in a warm dry climate, causing him to sweat profusely, and requiring like to drink more water. When no one else was around, it is more difficult for him to continue, if there’s a chance that he is on the wrong path, and no body available to tell him otherwise. With only abandoned buildings, if any, water was unavailable, which made the journey more tiring and physically straining. If the setting were different, this story would not have been as traumatic."	2	2		2																					
7454	3	"Topic: The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The features of the setting affect a cyclist or the major problem that a cyclist encounter are some rough road, inspection of the bike, putting on necessary equipment, do not exceed posted speed limit For a cyclist to be doing all this I don think there is going to be any features of the setting affect a cyclist. For a cyclist to maintaining the speed limit of @NUM1 or a water-depleting @NUM2: sometimes life can feel so cruel. At some point, tumbleweeds are caused by too much of speed but for them to be using the necessary equipment they won’t get seriously injured. Forget that old saying about never taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be “Never accept to"	1	1		1																					
7455	3	"The features of the setting really affected the cyclist. The author wrote of rough terrain and isolation. “Flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake”. After reading this information and the descriptions. I inferred that the author was alone in the desert with awful conditions. I go inferal a tone of resentment also. He seemed to wish he hadn’t taken the “shortcut” that landed him in the desert. The hot weather was another factor that affected the author, trying to keep my balance in a dehydrated state. He seems to have not really planned how long the ride would be and how to conserve water. The rough terrain desolation and hot temperatures seemed to have affected the cyclist / author."	2	3		3																					
7462	3	"The features of his journey are cruel. “Rolling hills,” make him work harder to get over them. The more he works, the more he sweats and therefore he needs fluids to do so. The lack of water he has does not help. Poisonous don’t really bother him if he leaves alone. The condition of the roads adds on to the hills. Rough roads make him work hard to get through and then over the hills. So this guy is getting it pretty rough."	2	1		2																					
7486	3	"The setting affected the cyclist by depriving him of hydration and weakening him. The large hills and rough roads ebbed away every bit of his strength and wore him down. The narration states, “Over one long, crippling hill” (kurmaskie @NUM1). This work choice reflects the writer’s feeling about his adventure. Words like “long” and “crippling” show that the trip was a horrible experience."	1	1		1																					
7488	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist when he was thirsty. “A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could be seen.” This proves that the rider was thirsty because in the paragraph before this talks about him having a last burst of energy going down a hill. And he was also sweating a lot. And also wiping sweat from his eyes. 	1	1		1																					
7490	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. The setting affected the cyclist performance. For example, the harsh temperature started to make his pedaling sluggish. The settings also made the cyclist a little frightened for instance, the cyclist came across a snake that he was terrified of. Again the settings affected the cyclist by tempting him. For example, the river tempted the cyclist to stop riding and go get a drink of water. In conclusion, the setting had a major affect on the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
7496	3	"The affects of the settings was how hot it was and the cyclist road he was on. The rider said it was June in the summer time, very hot. And the roads were not smooth, the were very old and ragady."	1	1		1																					
7500	3	"How the features of the setting affected the cyclist. The feature was that you should never take advice from old people that never get out of the house. For example in the story it says, “Never accept travel advice from collection of old. times who haven’t left confines of their porches since carter was in office.” This affecting the setting because if it weren’t for his map and let them take a peek at it, That would of saved him a load of trouble."	1	1		1																					
7502	3	"In the story, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. One setting feature is the rolling of steep hills. The hills make the cyclist exhausted and even more desperate for water. For example, in the story it says, “Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view”. This shows that the hill was very hard and strenuous to get over. By using the word crippling it informs us that the hill was brutal and very hard to get over. Another setting I feature that affects the cyclist is the absence of any civilization on his cycling path. While he was riding he notices that there is nobody around to help him if he gets in trouble or needs water. The absence of people makes him feel stressed and worried about his journey. It shows this in the story when he say, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind”. Also it says in the story “I was going to die and the bird would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear and a diary with the last entry on the parse of old men"". This shows that there was nobody around to help him and he knew it. He thought he would die alone and that birds would eat him. He was obnonely worried about the absence of people."	3	3		3																					
7503	3	"Usally the features, setting has an major affect upon the cyclist. The features, setting relates, and describes the hassh, and eventually relief condition of the cyclist. The setting relates to the person and plays a role, which the cyclist can observe. One reason how the features of the setting affects the cyclist is it shows the various problems that are being faced with the cyclist. For example, the cool pines, no one in sight, and I am alone. The way how this interepts a clear meaning, I the cyclist needs help getting home, and eventually by traveling, he needs water, to fill his thirst. Prior to thisy, the features, shows the weakness of the cyclist. For example, with that i believed it was my last burst of energy, as I consently, maneuvered down the hill. The features, and settings, affect the cyclist by showing how he was facing his troubles, thirst and fear, which all lead behind him at the end. These features and settings develop a clear understandmet, for the cyclist, and what is to be expected, in by him."	3	2		3																					
7508	3	The cyclist is affected by many features in the setting. the long hill is one example the snake and the dirt road are two more. The heat of the desert is another and his depleting water supply are all examples of features that affected him.	1	1		1																					
7516	3	"The cyclist was riding in some rough, dry and abandoned terrain that made his journey almost fatal. He described it as, “In the high deserts of California in June.” It was dry, lifeless and hot The sun was beating on him and he needed to frequently drink water, but he was running out. The empty towns were what he was wanting on for fresh water, but they’d been very abandoned. This made his journey very dangerous. He could’ve fallen off at any time because of heat stroke He would’ve died right then and there. His sweat was drying in the heat and there was no way for him to cool off in the lifeless desert: lifeless and dry. He had to enhance these extreme. Ironical conditions for miles on end, just to find some water. It was all that a desert is and all that a home shouldn’t go through."	2	3		3																					
7523	3	"Features of the setting affect the cyclist’s moods in many ways. The story says. “About fourty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ""town.” ""The cyclist is probably allready tired from pedaling for fourty miles. Then he finds out that the town is desserted, which makes him a little frustrated. The next few stops are also desserted and he is almost out of water. He is becoming desperate. The road becomes bumpy and there is a large snake blocking the way. He is terrified. Finally, he reaches a bait shop with cool water ,and he is relieved. As you can see, the cyclist goes though many moods caused by the setting of the story."	2	2		2

7525	3	"The cyclist was affected by the climate, the people, and the surrounding. The climate was the desert in June which was very hot with little water. This made him dehydrated and miserable. The old men that “helped” him acused think to be in the guiding situation he was in. There were no surrounding shop or buildings that were inhabined. This way there was no place for him to get any water nouroushment.       "	2	2		2																					
7532	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cyclist not sticking to his map. Instead of sticking to his map he had asked a couple of old people. The old people that gave the cyclist directions also gave him a short cut to take. That’s where the second effect came in where the cyclist started to use a shortcut instead of the main road. That’s how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.   	1	1		1																					
7539	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in this story alot. Having unreliable directions, barely enough water for the journey, poor road conditions and other hazards like the heat and animals made this a very difficult journey for the cyclist. Starting the journey the cyclist recieved bad information on how to get to his destonation which lead him on a long hard journey with not much water. He says in the story “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2”. This means he was running out of water too fast for the amount of land he was covering. Another feature of the netting that affected him was that the road conditions got worse and worse untill he reached a high way late in his journey. He said “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills."" This means the faster, easy, to ride terrain was replaced by slower harder to ride on terrain. These features of the setting could have been very dangerous and maybe factal and affected the cyclist alot living this story. "	3	2		3																					
7540	3	"The feature of the setting affected the cyclist, because as his surrondings changed he lost hope of making it to Yosemite National park. Such as when he was riding through his first town and it looked abandoned he wasn’t so sure if he shold keep going. As well as when he didn’t see anyone or any buildings he got worried and was wanting to lose hope. But  as second road sign appeared he was relieved."	2	1		2																					
7567	3	"Hot, bumpy roads, no shade-all are things that affect the cyclist on his journey. He was riding in??? the and then the sun started beating down on him and he said it felt like the desert,” considering it was so hot. The road was fine at first and than he get a while down the had and it really started getting rough and hard to ride on. The part where he has no shade has to suck because he has the sun beating down on him all the time. All are reasons why the cyclist shouldn’t have taken directions in the first place."	2	2		2																					
7571	3	The features effect the setting of the story in a big way. At the beginning of his ride there are people around and he has no troubles. After he talks to the old men and starts on his ride to the @NUM1 town there is no one around. There are no buildings in site at all and no source of water. Since there was no one around his confidence of actualy completing the trip begar to go down. Once he arrived at the first town he noticed that it was an old town and no one was there anymore. This made him mad and his confidence dropped a lot. Once he reached the next building he noticed that there was no one there either and then thought hed never make it and that he die. Once he reached the final place it was a more occupied setting. There were people around. He then began to feel relieved that he could get water. The setting with no one around make him lose a lot of confidence.	3	2		3																					
7573	3	"The feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It it was a straight road, it would be smooth sailing. If the road was bumpy, he’d jump up and down a little. If he was riding in the woods, it would be cool and a little dark. If he was riding in the desert, it would be very hot and bright."	1	1		1																					
7575	3	"When the cyclist passed through the old towns the old man told him to, the setting played a big part in making his situation harder to overcome when he passed through the first abandoned town, the water source was dry and empty. The text says ""pumped the handle for several minutes but the water would not cool it tasted like battery acid.” The second drink source he passed was on abandoned @PERSON1’s Juice factory. The text says,‘a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth.” These two objects made his situation mentally harder to get through because he was so close to what he needed numerous times, then it was taken away."	2	3		3																					
7579	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” a cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. He followed the ‘short cut’ that some old men gave him, instead of taking the longer route. These old men had no clue what they were realy talking about, so the cyclist ended up taking a path through more obstacles. When the cyclist was in need of more water he ran into ""several rusty pumps."" No water would come out of these pumps so he had no choice but to keep going @CAPS1 water. As he moved forwad in his travels he said that the “Flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills.” @CAPS1 any water, he did not have much strength left to face rolling hills, but he had no choice. The cyclist had to go on for miles @CAPS1 seeing anyone or anything. “There was noone in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" His troubles finally came to an end after getting directions from another man at a fish camp."	2	2		2																					
7580	3	The setting adds a sense of ergancy. The cyclist is running out of water and he is the middle of the dessert. If he had been in the forest or the subburbs it would not be so grave. He talks about passing out and dieing. He exclaims it did n’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds were going to pick me clean.”	2	2		2																					
7582	3	"The way the settings affect the cyclist is very crucel. First, the cyclist took directions from someone who has not left thier porch in decades. So once he accepted the directions and used them problems occurred. One main problem is the cyclist has a lack of water supply. Also the cyclist has incounters with snakes. Another the directions where way off so he had longer to go then he thought. Also when he arrived from his journey he found a deserted town. So in conclusion the cyclest uses his own directions from now on."	2	2		2																					
7585	3	The setting affected the cyclist by making him very hot. He said he started sucking on stones because he heard that if you suck on stones it makes you not thirsty. He also said he might hit a bump and swallow one of the rocks. He said he wanted to swallow the rocks. The reason for that was that he was so hot. He didn’t even no where he was goin.	1	1		1																					
7594	3	"The cyclist was is a horrible nasty environment for cycling, but the thing that really threw the cycle off was running out of water. There were no houses to refill his bottle or no one around to give him updated directions. From the heat made him drink more water and also harder to breath in extreme heat. Without those faults the cyclist would have been fine."	1	1		1																					
7597	3	"Some of the features like the change in landscape affected the cyclist. Differing from flat land to miniture hills to highways is kind of hard to cope with, especially considering he was dehydrated and had no water."	1	1		1																					
7601	3	"The cyclist chose to ride through the worst terrain one can ride through. The cyclist rode through deserts and deserted towns. Thats when he started to get thirsty. At first he wasn’t tired or thirsty because he was riding by cool trees and rushing water in the morning. Once he got to the desert part with no water source then he got thirsty and started to drink his water which depleted fast. The lack of a dry place can make you thirsty by itself but after riding a while it became bad. The setting had everything, to do on how the cyclist had no water and thought he was going to die from heatstroke. That’s how the setting affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
7609	3	"In ‘Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” a cyclist follows some bad advice, which leads him on a tough ride through the desert with little water. The setting has a large effect on the cyclist because it causes him to be dehydrated, which presents the main conflict of the story. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,” the author states when his fresh water supply begins to run out. Another factor the setting presents to the cyclist is the extreme heat of the California desert. This adds to the cyclist thirst and dehydration. The reader can tell it is unpleasantly hot when reading, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt…, that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…” The rough roads and challenging terrain also present a challenge to the cyclist that slows his advance to Yosemite."	2	2		2																					
7616	3	"In the short story Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted  Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affects the cyclist. When at the old codgens house, he is confident in himself, because they have told how of a shortcut to Yosemite, giving that confidence he needs, as he leaves, he is still confident, these as the settings changes, so does the mood of the cyclist. after ""about @NUM1 miles into te pedal"", the cyclist arrives at the first town, he has despair because it is a ghost town,"" still having confidence, he lack of water, he continues on. after a couple more miles, he comes to small fork with a pump.

Now he desparate, no water, dehydrated, and no towns around, he began to pedal and pedal, hoping to find a town around.

In the end, the setting effect how the cyclist back against confident, then desperate as water is used, than relieved when water is found."	3	3		3																					
7617	3	"This would be a hard risk to begin with, but the cycalist is taking it in the desert. As we all know, the desert can get boiling hot, so a bike ride could get enjoyable quickly. Also, when the only thing you see for miles is rode, sand and an empty factory, your moral can easily dray quickly. It’s just an overall way setting to give lost in."	1	1		1																					
7624	3	"In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1,” the setting is used to alter the cyclists mood and as a reflection of his situation. For example, the statement “the cool pines and rushing river of Yosemite had my name written all over them” helps describe the cyclist situation. The idea of lush, cool water vegetation gives the @CAPS4 hope during his increasinlgly hellish trip. The beauty of that setting also reflects on the comfort that would come from reaching Yosemite; the good setting equal a good out come. Later on, the cyclist comes across “one ramshackle shed, several rusts pump, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest make.” This is a depressing setting symbolizing a complete loss of hope. And inteact at this point the cyclist becomes troubles to his situation. While pedaling through desert, the cyclist becomes even more factory when tumble seed, which is always a symbol of a deserted area, cones by. The nile of setting to affect and mirror mood is nothing new. There are many examples of this literary technique throughout history. For example, in his story “The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @PERSON1.” @CAPS4 @PERSON1 was a deslated land filled wild beast to symbolize and cause @PERSON2 to change his personalith surrounded by uncivilized people and creating @PERSON2 tears of his clothes and hunt like a dog. The setting of a desert in the uncultured. Part of colonial simultaneously cause and reflects on this change. The setting in the essay “Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit” is used as an important for character development.  "	3	3		3																					
7626	3	"The cyclist is faced with many challenges on his journey to Yosemite, one of which is travelling through the California deserts. This was quite a challenge because a desert is very hot and dry, plus the author was riding his bike, making  himself more thirsty and hot. He also encountered a big snake that appeared to be a diamondback which he avoided even though it almost covered the road. The author also had to deal with rough terrain when he rode his bike through the hills. The biker met the challenges and progressed through them with bravery."	2	2		2																					
7630	3	"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting affects the story very much for many reasons. First, it is in the summer, so it is very hot. Also, it is in the desert in the west, so there is a very warm climate already. Third, there is not any civilization on the “shortcut” he follows, so there is no way for the author to get any water to replenish his body with. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story."	1	2		2																					
7631	3	"The setting affects the cyclist a lot, because is it was windy too it would be had for the cyclist to control the bike. So is  too has a lot as buildings and people outside their would be a lot as traffic so they would not  be allowed to let the cyclist go there so the cyclist would  has to turn back. Then if it was a clear road  and nobody was there ad no bulidings or houses were there then it wold be an easy ride for the cyclist. So as you can see the setting affects the cyclist in many ways."	0	1		1																					
7637	3	"In the story “rough road ahead” the setting and the features affect the cyclist. For example in the story he says “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate”. This shows that the features are rough because he would most likely not be that desperatly thirsty unless it was very hot out. The setting and features of this story is it takes place in California, on a hot day. Another quote that could support the question is when the author says, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.” This shows that it is hot because he is sweating. This also could show that it is hot because he thinks it’s a mirage, and people usually see them in the desert, where it is hot."	2	2		2																					
7638	3	"In the essay ”Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. To begin, the as the cyclist rode on for the first miles, he did not see anything in sight. This made him less determined to reach his goal. Then, in paragraph @NUM1, the cyclist saw a building which helped him to gain strength to reach his goal. The cyclist’s determination went down as long as he was riding. But then at last he came to a building that gave him relief and more confidence in himself."	2	1		2																					
7643	3	The features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist. He is riding through this deserted and beaten up town that makes him feel weird. After that he starts to ride through the desert when a huge snake gets in his way and scares him even more. When he arrives at the abandoned juice factory he is almost completely out of energy and almost can’t go on any further in his journey until he finally arrives at the bait shop. Most of the features in the setting scare the cyclist but they all affect him.	2	2		2																					
7645	3	"The location of a cyclist’s ride affects the person’s attitude and strength. If the road is full of hills, it takes a little more strength to maintain speed. When put in this situation, Kurmaskie writes “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” This shows how one gets drained by hills. Also, being in a desert situation can weaken a cyclist due to thirst.The cyclist in the reading was desperate enough to try pump water that looked “brackish.” So, setting can break a cyclist."	2	2		2

7679	3	"In the story “Do not exceed posted speed” by @PERSON1, the cyclist faces problems caused by the setting. The biker was riding and the heat was scourching and the biker was really getting dehydrated and tired and he was running out of water. Because it was so hot the biker had to drink more water to replenish his body of all the sweat he was loosing while biking. The hills of the terrain were making it harder on the biker by making him us more energy and liquid to keep going. If it had been cool and breezy he would have had no problem making that distance. If the surrounding area was full of people and not abandoned towns than he would have had water to drink."	1	1		1																					
7681	3	"The features of the setting would have affected the cyclist a lot. There is a man who takes the advice of old men and takes a “shortcut” to Yosemite Park. The shortcut only leads him to thirst, and no park. The narration states, “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth couldstill be seen (Kurmaskie @NUM1). ""This feature could affect the cyclist by discouraging him. the cyclist comes to the first “town” but only finds yet again no water, and a picture of something that makes him more thirsty. It could also make him be more angry at the old men because they led him on this pointless journey. Another feature that @MONTH1 affect the cyclist is the lack of trees or shade. The only thing he could feel was the sun beating down on his back. The narration states, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.(Kurmaskie @NUM1).” This also makes the cyclist believe that old men do not know what they are talking about."	2	3		3																					
7687	3	"The setting effected the performence of the cyclist and the mood of the cyclist. The rolling hills the cyclist had to get over most likely made him more fined and thirsty because he had to put more effort in to get over them. “over one long, crippiling hill, a building came into view.” The long, big hills that he had to go up and made him more thirsty, but probably more satisfied when it was all over. Ironically, the building was a grape juice factory; abandoned and rusty, but the sigh featuring a boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice was still noticeable. This brought his hopes down. But continued to move on. In my life, I have never had such an experience to where I had to keep pushing and urging myself to my goal, but the closes I got, the more distractions got in the way to and stop me."	2	3		3																					
7689	3	"The young cycolist began his day confident in looking forward to his day of riding across california, slowly, however as he recognizes his been directed wrongly, his mood changes,& he begins to feel more hopless. AS he begins, he feels carefree & mody for anything. He writes ""I checked, checked my water supply & moved on. The sun was beginning to heat down, not I barely noticed it. The surroundings have little effect on him. Later, on he realizes his water was going down, & he is getting tired, his mood changed to exhaustion & defect. Here he writes “i got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles & stuch them in my mouth with any luck I’d hit a bump of lodge one in my throat.” He has become sarcastic of saddened by the hoplessness of his journey. Eventually, he had relief of the cold water helps to bring up his spirits & sense of humor"	3	3		3																					
7690	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the begginning the setting was at the old man’s place and the cyclist was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store he was excited and relived. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip	2	2		2																					
7700	3	"The cyclist in this essay is trying to go to Yosemite National Park. He feels confident in him making it, not realizing what is up ahead. First comes the windy roads. As he goes along his confidence starts to wither away. The desert hits him like a boulder because he is running short on water and needs to rest. The extreme heat just makes everything worse. “Not the miley into this heat section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. “This shows that the cyclist did not expect to meet this kind of terrain and is over whollmed by it. The one thing he never does is give up. This is important because as he went along, just before hagon up, he found a place to get water and to relax. “Then, as easily as running about, my troubles thirst, and nor were all behind me” This shows that he was strong and determined to survive and he finally found what he needed and it made happy and have a will to live. Everyone in life needs to be determined."	3	3		3																					
7703	3	"The features of the setting in this story make the ride more difficult for the cyclist. For example, the cyclist is moving through the “… high   deserts of California… “   (kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the cyclist is at a high altitude, which makes breathing more difficult. Then the cyclist notes that the “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills “   (Kurmaskie @NUM1   ). The hills would make the trip more difficult. This is evidenced by the cyclist describing one   of them as a   “… long, crippling hill… “ (Kurmaskie @NUM1 ). Clearly, the terrain, which got   increasingly difficult, negatively affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
7705	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist like if you have to goup hill or along long bumpy type roads. Then in the essay it says “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit: @CAPS1 does make things more difficult than average. Especially with a lack of water to make things worse.	1	1		1																					
2982	2	"In life you have the 'offensive things'. The little stuff that gets under our skin and eats away at us.  No it is not easy to get over ,but these things will make you stronger. Sometimes there are books, magazines, music and movies  that offened us. The only reason why we get offensive is because the subject either reflects our personality, or our life. It's not the authors fault, they write what they feel and what is the truth.          Okay, so libraris are full of book's, movies, music, etc. You can't just take books off the shelves, just because they offened you. Other people @MONTH1 like the book you hate. There are more books in the library you can read.           Another reason people shouldn't remove offensive material out of the library; it will hurt whoevers' company got the book published and also the writters. Writters and publishers would lose so much money because the library sells' there books,magazines, movies. They make thousands of copies of thier product, which takes money. So to make thier money back ,they sell to thousands of book stores.           Must of the offensive material will open the worlds eye's. Everybody needs to see whats going on in the world. Books, newspapers tell the truth about a subject. Now the writters intent is'nt to hurt you but to help you. Why cant the world be more open?          I know in my own life i have read books that at first ,the book offended me. I would get so mad, i would put the book down and walk away. But then,my eyes would open and finaly it hit me.  The offensive part out of the book helped myself relives a new understanding. The views i used to have would be gone. It is strange how you finnaly open up, and your life changes.     Some people might even find this paper offensive. But if nobody is stepping on your toes, and getting under your skin you wont ever change. Offened is a word used lightly; yes, people use it a lot but do they really mean it. Some people need to use 'well this book bugs me'. Stop being about yourselves and get over it. Life is to short to worry and feel offended.      Every single book, magazine,movie and music needs to be left alone. Those materials @MONTH1 reflect other peoples life and help others with thiers'. Just read another book, or watch a different move. Please do not remove anything from the selves, because it will only do more damage"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
2985	2	"Do you think that you should be able to take certian materials off a shelf of a library, because someone finds it offensive? Here are some of the examples that I can think of just off of the top of my head. Books, movies, music, magazines, or even computer excess. So if you wouldn't mind sit back get relacked in a good comfortable spot, because here we go.      So have you desided what you think about taking them off the self of your local libary or even your school library. We I have came up with what I think about it. In some way yes, but in other ways no. For an example I bet there are old books in my school library right know that haven't even been picked up for a long time, just because they are old and overly out dated.     The reason I say they shouldn't be pulled off the shelf of a library. Well just becasue some people seems that it's offensive, doesn't mean it couldn't almost the most popular book in the hole library. The person that likes that book might find that the poeple that found the book offensive, they book might be offending the other person. So if you think about it, you will  always have the poeple that like to complain about something no where you go.      I just put an example out there of what I have seen. I was at a library one time and there way these to guys. One was complaining how the farm books never get messed with. Then the other guy walked up with two of the books that was over there in the farm section of that library. So the librarian is just taking in all the information that the two guys was disabuting during that time. During all of this I was just about five feet form the counter these guys was at. So then the guy that was talk about how the farm books should get pulled off the shelf he ask the librarian where the books was on spaceships. Then the guy that was getting the farm books said you really should take them off the shelf because he hasn't seen anyone over that way for years.     So that is just to tell you that if you was to take a book, some music, or any other of the thinks that you can find in a library should just more in likely stay where they are, because the library got them books or any of that other stuff for a reason. That reason is, because you don't ever know what someone might just come walking through that door just looking for that lonely book, magizne, movie, or just need to get on the computer.     Well know that you probably getting tired of hearing the reasons why I think no books or any other things should get pulled off the shelf. Now it's time to tells you why they should get pulled off the shelf of that local library in your neiborhood.     The main reason somethings should get pulled off the shelf of the local library or school library is if the book was really damaged. For an example I have been to one of the libraries in my county and they had a book in there that the back cover of the book was torn completly off. That is bad that they would have that on there shelf, just because that makes there library looks like a trashed up place to go to.     Another reason why something should get pulled off the shelf is if the book supported drugs. Like if there was a books about some that was doing drug and they got cought with them and they just got a 'slap on the wrist' as I call it. A slap on the wrist is when you get in trouble for something and you don't even get in any trouble you just get handed over to your parents. That is what I think the saying 'just a slap on the wrist' means.      So all in all more in likely the book should probably just stay on the shelf. Like I said earlier in this essay, you will always have you people that like to complain about every little pitty thing they can find to complain about. Which I mostly learned that from the state tractor pulling club. So I hope that I haven't taken to much of your time up. So just think next time you are at a library and you see a book and you think man that book needed to be taken off the shelfs, just refer back to this essay"	2	3		2	2	3	2																		
2992	2	"When talking about censorship in libraries, I don't think the people that work in the libraries should decide what goes on the shelves. The people of the community should have a say on what goes on the shelves, because their the ones thats going to the library anyway.                 I believe that everybody is intitle to their own opinion, but I think certain materials should be removed.  For example, some music could be offensive; therefore, I'm not saying that music shouldn't be totally removed from libraries. I'm saying the offensive music should be removed"	3	2		3	2	2	2																		
2996	2	"If the people that are publishing and writing these articles in these magazines then yes, they can feel offensive about the @CAPS7 things inside the magazine or books. These people are going to always find something or some rumor to start a big fight about these @CAPS1 things, those people are called '@CAPS2'. They can find A eazy way to get something started just like that, That's why before i buy A magazine, I take A look inside of first And see If @CAPS3 interested in buying that specific certain book, or magazine. If I don't like the things that I see inside of @CAPS5, then I @CAPS4 not buy @CAPS5, @CAPS5's @CAPS1 As that.

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that I work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no nooks left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 statement was from @PERSON1.  Do you think it is right for young children to look at immages that are not appropiate or read something that is talking baout sexual content?  I do not think any of these materials should be removed from the shelves, but they should be put in a privite area where only adults can get to them.       I think they should be put in a certain area, away from children, because children will get ideas from the material that they see and think it is okay to act like that.  There are some books and movies out there that teenagers and young children see that are about cereal killers and children think it is okay to bring guns to school and it is not okay.  Children are reading these books and thinking it is okay to act like their favorite character or acting like their favorite movie star in a movie.  Some of the movies that are out there are about doing stupid stuff, and children and teenagers think it is 'cool' because the person that they look up to is doing that, so they want to try it out also.  Children get hurt from doing @CAPS1.  Whenever a child sees people having sex, they think it is okay to do it too, becasue those kids in the movies are the same age as they are.   I think that movie producers shoudl be aware of what they put out there for children to watch.       When you talk about the book @CAPS2 @CAPS3, you think what a great book.  But would you ever think that it would be taken off of shelves because of one word that was used in it?  I think that it should stay on the shelves, but if a parent does not want their child to read it, then they do not have to read it.  If parents do not want their child to read something then just tell the teacher or child that they cannot read the book.  I think the books should stay on the shelves and any material that has any 'bad' sontent on it should be put in a private section where only adults can get to it.       Do you want your children looking at bad pictures or seeing or reading about something with sexual content?  Children are getting bad ideas from books, movies, magazines, and music.  They think it is appropiate to act like @CAPS1, because their favotire movie star is preforming @CAPS1 way.  These books, movies, and magazines need to be put up out of children's reach, so they cannot get anymore bad ideas to do stupid stuff"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3006	2	"A book is more than words or happenings; they're adventures and stories that travel from one person to another. I find it amazing how someone from one country could write a book, then someone from another country could read it. Inspiring stories reach from one person to another in books, music, and movies; I believe things like that help shape us into who we are today.      There are many problems with entertainment today in my oppinion. They include things now that show a lot of violence and intimacy; which @MONTH1 not be fit for some people.  I don't think they should take them off the shelves, but simply rate them so everyone knows what to expect. Movies are rated because some people don't want or need to see what will happen in them. While some of it is not appropriate, other parts of it guide us. It's almost like they are preparing us for the worst, but are hoping for the best. We see what happens to one person in these articles of entertainment, and it helps us to make sure we don't make the same mistake.       I also believe that many stories and movies inspire us to be better people and to reach for our dreams. If we see that one person can do it, we think, why can't I? Where would we be in the world if no one encouraged or pushed someone else to do what they wanted? Entertainment pushes that concept, but adds everything in it to show the reality of it. Whether these things have offense or harsh contents to them, they still prepare and help us to battle through everyday life."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3007	2	"I don't believe that certain books, music, magzines, or movies should be removed. If they are found offensive then that is not my problem. If they offend me then oh well that is my issue to deal with. When it comes to any of the mentioned items, sooner or later society will find them again and they will be back on the shelves.     No matter how offensive they are curiosity will bring them back on the shelves. If a book id found offensive by one person or group of people that doesnt mean it should be removed off of the shelves. That is a problem that the one person or group of people will have to live with.      Anything and everything is educational in it's own way. Even if it is offensive it can teach someone wrong from right. That being said is it wrong or right for someone to want something offensive to removed from the shelves? It depends on a persons personal views or beliefs. Whether they like it or not things are offensive to somebody out there and there is nothing we can do out there to change that.     It's sad to admit, but there really isn't anything to change that. It's just easier to live with it. Maybe whatever you found offensive wasn't meant to be offensive. It depends on what you take offence to. Maybe the writer, director, or composer meant for something to be offensive, maybe they didn't. It's all based on how you take what they said into thought. So when it boils down to it nothing should be removed from the shelves. For if one thing must be removed then youi might as well remove everything."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3009	2	"Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should not be removed from certain library shelves because people have enough sense on what they are interested in and what they are not interested in.  There will always be people that find specific thoughts or ideas offensive no matter what the subject is, so censorship does not really make a difference to the individual.  Censorship is not necessary because people know what they are interested in without anyone helping them find what they are looking for.       Censorship is not entirely necessary because people will always find something that they are not exactly looking for or interested in.  People's interests are their own business without the censorship of others in the surrounding community.  I've read a couple books that have cussing in them, but the book is still as good as it would be without the cussing in it.  People like things no matter what, because there will always be flaws with some objects such as books, music, and movies.  Books, music, and movies all have much interest from the common person, and each individual is capable of making their own decisions based on what they are interested in.  The individual does not need edited objects, or music to listen to the music or other objects without being offended.  There is something offensive to people in every work that has been published, and the buyer is fully aware of that fact before they go and buy something.     Censorship is not necessary because individuals are aware of what they are interested without anything telling them what to look for.  People will almost always get offended about what they are watching or listening to no matter what it is, so why is censorship such a big deal?  Censorship is not needed in today's society because each specific individual is capable of making their own decision in what's best for themselves.  Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should not be taken away from the library shelves because there will always be some offensive objects that some individuals will find offensive no matter what the object is."	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
3011	2	"Would you want your childern reaing about things that only @CAPS1 know's what? When you go to a library you aspect to learn about @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @LOCATION1's @CAPS4,@CAPS5 etc. Libraries are for learning new things about the world that will later help you in @CAPS9. When you first walk into a library you except to see people checking out @CAPS2 books , or books that catch your eye just by the title. If we find a book is offensive , or will not help better our childerns' future then stand up and fight for their own  mental development.     We must also think of what the childern want to read. They have the right to read what ever they want, as long as it's entertaining to them and they are learning something new. Some books teaches them about the world they are growing up in. There are some books that I would not let my own child read, but I know in my heart that she is learning something that I @MONTH1 not be able to teach her. Those types of books of are what I call, '@CAPS7's'. Those books that can come off seeming offensive, when in the end they are actually, what I call '@CAPS8', helping to prepare them for what is it come. Not every book will be full of rainbows, pretty colors, or pop-ups. They must know that they are some people they have to be mindfull of, and people who are educating them on @CAPS9. They have to learn the difference between what's right, and what's wrong.          Remember the first book you ever read by yourself? I do. It was called 'Of @CAPS10 and @CAPS11'. I read that book when I was @NUM1. Till this day my mother says, 'I tried to stop you from reading that book so many times , it had dangerous wording that an @NUM1 year should no be able to read at that young age'. What she did not know was that; that book had taught me alot about the world back then. That knowledge I had obtain then had helped me later on my @CAPS9.           Some books are ment to be read while some aren't. If you feel your child should not read a certain book then read it for yourself, and then tell your child the reason why they can not read the same book you had just read."	4	3		4	3	3	3																		
3014	2	"There are many types of materials in the library to entertain you. Some of these materials @MONTH1 be books, magazines, movies, and music. Each person has their own type of information and genres that they like. For example, most teenage girls love to read young romance stories, and about young peoples' lives; @CAPS1 people like informational books. Everyone is different in their own way. The material they choose to read is their own choice.           How would you feel if one of your favorite books or magazine were taken off the shelves of all the libraries? You would probably wonder why such a thing would happen. Well, some people would like to argue about how some of the information that is contained in such materials are offensive or innapropriate. They want these types of things to be taken off the shelves. But is it their decision to say that some things offend people?                       Everyone has their own opinion and can make their own choice on what they want to read or what they do not want to read. In my opinion, these types of materials should stay on the shelves. It is simple, if you do not like a certain genre of magazines or books, do not read them. If you hear someones music, and it sounds completely awful to you, then just walk away or listen to your own music. Theres a new movie out about how the world is going to end, and you disbelieve in the fact that the world will not end that way, do not go and see it.      Some parents do not want their children to know about some of the things that are out there in the world, which is completely understandable. But, everyone has rights to what they want to know and what they do not want to know. If everyone had a right to take away some books that they think are not appropriate, do you think there would be any books left? The thing is, is that in today's society, people want to do what they want and think what they want. Some people do not agree with most things, but that is something they will have to face, because not everyone can be happy"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3016	2	"One essential right that every man, woman, or child should have is the freedom of speech. Without this right no one would be able to express their views. When libraries pull books, magazines, movies, and music off of their shelves it takes away that right. Even if the matter of the subject is offensive to some people, the books or other items should be left on the shelves.      What one person finds offensive another could find miraculous. If one person does not find the content of a book attractive then simply do not read the book. Libraries should not censor the material that they put on the shelves just because someone does not like it. I do think however, that books should be placed in the secton that they belong. Sections for childrens books, young adult books, adult books, and many more can all be found in a library. An example would be that a book about the anatomy of the human body does not belong in the childrens section. beyond this, the library should leave the rest of the decisons to the reader. If someone wanted to read a book on the @LOCATION1, then that person should be able to go to a library and check the book out. The problem with censorship is that a @CAPS1 could find the book offensive and want it removed from the shelves. Then the person interested in the @LOCATION1 would not be able to withdrawl the book.     The choice of what material you read should be left up to you, not restricted by what someone else finds offensive. Libraries should not remove items from their shelves if someone else finds it offensive to their own beliefs. The person should just not read the book. Everyone is going to have a different opinion on most things and therefore, there should not be censorship in libraries"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3020	2	"Do you want your nine year old @CAPS2 talking and reading about inappropreite subjects such as sexual relationships or language? No! I know I wouldn't for my @CAPS2. I think books that are offensive and inappropreite shouldn't be in @LOCATION1 school or elementray schools with little ones or even @NUM1 years olds. And parents should be in conrol of what thier kids watch and listen too.     Honstley we can't control how people make movies or what singers are saying in songs but we can control who listens to them and watches them. Its the parents that are the only ones who can control thier children, no one else.     In libraries I feel like its the librarians who are the cause for letting children read offensive books. And I don't mean any disrespect but wouldn't you agree? I mean think about it, librarians are the ones in control of the books that are in the library, and I think that they should make sure that the book young teens are checking out are appropraite enough for them to read. Ones that don't involve sex or violence that @NUM1 year olds shouldn't be reading.     Here's an idea, maybe libraries should have @DATE1 year olds sign a paper or have a certain card with them that allows them to check out that certain book or @CAPS4. And it should have parents permisson on it showing that the parents approve of this. But I think high schoolers should only be aloud to do this because they are more mature than younger ones. They know better than to start fights or cuss in school.          All I'm saying is that I DO agree with this problem, parents are the reason thier kids are immature and rude because they @CAPS1 thier children get away with the attitude and rudeness. So yes parents and other people do have the right to sensor movies and book, etc.     But what about @CAPS4 theaters you ask? DONT @CAPS1 YOUR @CAPS2 @CAPS3 TO THE @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 YOU!!! It's that simple. Students in high school @CAPS3 to the @CAPS5 after school with friends and get in to see rated @CAPS7 movies @CAPS6 parents. And I do believe that some of them use fake @CAPS8 so they don't need a parent with them. Teens will @CAPS3 home that night and want to re-enact what they saw in the @CAPS4. Even if it's sex, or fights or even language. It's really sad that parents allow this to happen and I think the parents should grow up and disapline thier students. I've seen to many parents letting thier children get away with thier mouth and attitude. Most of my friends parents @CAPS1 thier children get away with everything.      One of my friends is really bad at getting what she wants. She told me that all she has to do is cry and she gets what she wants. I don't always get what I want and I don't want every new thing out there because I don't deserve it. I have to earn to get a new phone or a laptop. I ask my parents and they eaither say we don't have enough money or you don't need it and I just move on with my life. But I don't @CAPS1 books or movies control my life and change who I am. Those things aren't that important. I mean the ones that talk about school or some random story that some stranger wrote and it just happened to show up in the school libraries. The stories or movies, etc., that teens should really pay attention to are the edicational ones. The ones that teach us about life and society. About the future and teach us how life is as an adult and ready us for the real world. Because once those seniors open those high school doors and graduate it's no more staying up late and sleeping in and parting on the weekends. Its the real world, the adult world.     So please read this carefully and I hope what I have said has helped you realize why people sensor these things. Why kids are acting the way they are. Libraries should sensor certain things and not allow students below high school to read them.

3024	2	"Libraries are our way of knowing what has happened in the past whether it is all fact or maybe fiction.  No matter what type of book it is, it still tells us a story of another place and another time. Libraries should not be censored.     Taking away one book because of one sentence that seems vulgar and inapropriate for young readers is wrong.  I understand that reading books with adult material such as drug abuse and sexuality can lead to experimentation but is that not life?  At least once in our exsistance on earth we find ourselves curious about something at we try it, just to see what it is like.  It is all a learning experience.      History would most likely be the touchiest subject in our libraries mainly because we are asshamed of what we acted like thirty plus years ago, discrimination in @LOCATION1, the @CAPS1, and now the wars in the middle east.  Some countries do not even teach their own history to students in school because they are embarrassed of what happened or afraid that it might happen again if the students know @CAPS6, why and what happened.  Reading and knowing about what our ancestors did will help us lead a better future not distroy it.      Today's media has overflowed with adult material not suitable for kids under @NUM1.  If anything we need to start censoring what we broadcast on television and also what we post on the @CAPS4 and leave our libraries alone. Most of the books that are in our libraries has been there for like forty years so it is completely pointless to remove it when it has already educated young minds for over forty years.      I truthfully do not know why you would want to remove books or censor them with a sharpie marker.  All that is doing is giving readers less material to read.  In @LOCATION2, elementary educators are not required to teach their students @CAPS6 to spell, at all. I walked into a third grade classroom and watched a girl spell @CAPS2 '@CAPS3' thinking that was the correct why to spell @CAPS2.  The @ORGANIZATION1's excuse for not having teachers teach @CAPS6 to spell is that they should learn that from reading books everyday.  Well guess what @LOCATION2, with the @CAPS4, gaming systems and iPods, little kids are not taking to reading like they did ten years ago and we are going to have a lot of future adults not know @CAPS6 to read and this is what it is going to be like.      '@CAPS5 @CAPS6 do you spell encyclopedia?'     '@CAPS6 should i know, I wasn't taught @CAPS6 to spell in @LOCATION2.'     You see what I mean, so if you are going to take away the ability to spell you better not take away our books becuase they are the only things teaching our @ORGANIZATION1's future on @CAPS6 to spell simple words.        Today we have the @CAPS4, gaming systems, iPods and @CAPS8 to intertain us on a daily basis.  No one is taking to reading as a way to relieve boredom, they are just sitting on the couch watching television.  And now if you reduce reading material for teens and young readers you are not incouraging us to read.  You are taking away all of the interesting parts of a book.  To be truthfull I will read and reread a book many times over if it is a good story with some extra sizzle.  I do not enjoy books that do not have drugs, alcohol, family stress, war stories or even some sexuality mainly because books without that are boring.  When i read books like that they make me feel better about my life and @CAPS6 I interact with others.  I have learned @CAPS6 to deal with all of those things from books.  Most of my knowledge comes from those types of books and I would hate for my children to not be able to read the same materials as I did at their age and learn from those books"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3030	2	"Books, music, movies, magazines, and more are a good way to learn. Some of that material is bad though, but some is good. Not all people are the same, and not all books or magazines are the same.     Books, newspapers, and magazines are good things, and they could be bad things. Some talk about nonfiction and some fiction. Others talk about famous people and all the good and mainly bad things they did this week, which is something some of us want to read but none of us should read or even write in the first place. Then there are books that have a childs story in them. There are also articles that everyone should read about, like somebody who saved a whole lot of people on @DATE1. There is a diverse amount of things to read out there, you just need to use a little discretion about what to read and put out on the shelves at a public library.     Music is another good way to express yourself. There is good old fashioned @CAPS1 music such as @ORGANIZATION1. Then there is stuff that nobody should listen to, or for that matter even sing about like almost all @CAPS2 Music. They also have little childrens songs which no matter how annoying that most of it is, it's alright for anyone to listen to. Or you can pick up some good ol' @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or any other christian artists or gospel music.The music of this world is very diverse.     The movies of today can, but most of the time aren't,be  good things. You could pick up an educational video that talks about animals that most everyone could watch. There are also bad movies such as @CAPS5 and @CAPS6.It is a horror movie that made it hard to fall asleep for a few days. Those are some that nobody should even produce.There are video copies of television shows as well, which can be alright. The vast amount of movies made today should not even be a thought in someones mind but some are good and educational.     So in conclusion, I think it should be reader and viewer discretion when it comes to content of things as this. Libraries everywhere should have most everything there is.Next time your in a library, just use discretion"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3035	2	"Many pepole think that offensive material should be removed from the libary because children could pick then up and look in them. I do not belive this should be done.     They already have a childrens section if a child looks in a inappropiate book outside of the childrens section then its thier fault. I do not think it should inconvience someone to have to go elsewhere to get that cd,game,book, or movie they were looking for. It is very hard to come across a inapropiate book without looking for it on purpose. It could be a book used for teaching health or nursing class and is not meant to be inapropiate at all.          These are a few things you should consider when choosing a side on this debate. Who knows we might have to vote on it someday"	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
3039	2	"I think that everyones opinion is different about some books getting removed from the library.     Do I believe that certian books should be removed from the library: yes and no. The reason why I choose yes and no is because some books are helpful to others for there class and their research for whatever class they need it for. Another reason why I say no is because of the fact, if the book offense you then dont read the book or think about what is says just leave it alone.     The other reason why I picked yes is because if it shows some hurtful words in there towards other thats refering to the people thats its talking about then yes it needs to be removed before others start using thoes kinds of hurtfuls words to the piers or  thier elders. If the book contains racial slurs to different races then yes they need to removed asap. If others get ahold of these kinda books then everyone would use them agianst each other which in relsult of that would cause an outbreak of fights people aruging with each other, just pure hate between thoes people using it agianst the different races.     These are my opinions of removing some books that contains hurtful things or meaning in them that can contain voilence in them or call another person out of thier name or race"	3	3		3	2	3	2																		
3044	2	"I don't Believe in censorship of libraries. Were @CAPS1 we live in a free country, and have the right to have access to the matrial we want from libraries. It doesnt matter if its age aproprite or not. If you dont want your kids listening to that bad rap artist, or watching that @CAPS2 rated movie, then its your responsibility as a parent to keep it from them.     Part of what makes @LOCATION1 so great is the freedom that come with living here. If we allowed anyone to censor a library then we would have no books to read, movies to watch, or music to listen to. Katherine paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hompe none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' this quote shows that if anyone had the right to pull a book from the shelf we wouldnt have any books left.     Censorship would just be the start.It could lead to the government censoring information from the public that they don't want us to know. which would take away the greatness of @LOCATION1, we wouldn't be free.     Censorship of libraries would take away our rights. witch is why i apose it"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3046	2	"I belive if the books, music, movies, magazines and etc. are offensive and are bad that they should be removed, the reason being is because of younger children.       Younger children are not aloud to be exsposed to that stuff if it's bad or not pertand to them. Since there are books, music, movies, magazines and etc. that are bad and offensive, then I would suggest a room or some sort of place that they can be held and were only adualts can be around them and can get to them.      Movies and magazines are my biggest thing that would worry me. There are more bad things in them then in books or music. Books and music have bad language but very rarely have bad images or other things like that. If there happen to be a book, music, movie, or magzine that you or any other person thinks that is inaproprete or offensive then you or that person would have permision to take it off and show it the main desk, and let them know what you think about it.     I feel that they should seperated the censorship in libraries to keep the children safe. They should steel be aloud to have censorship books, music, movies, and magazines because adult can handle that kind of material to where younger children can't. So therefore to keep everything sepreate, and there shouldnt be no problem."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3047	2	"Many people are very stern about there thoughts when they believe in something very strongly.  In other peoples eyes you @MONTH1 find some who disagree and do agree with you from having similar life experiences.  All of which peoples opinions are created by life experiences and many tragedy' they have been apart of.  You will find sooner or later that some of the problems that many people deal with, that there is someone who has a lot worse than you do and that you should enjoy every moment you can.     Opinions are alternated often about many different things, being a homosexual is one of the many that people debate about most often.  In my opinion it doesn't really matter whether your homosexual or not you have to understand that everyone is different in there own way.  Exceptence is what' key to making eveyone get along at some point, but people struggle with homophobia.       Another big debate that many people have are with female and male opinions.  It seems as if they dont get along because they disagree, but neither could live without each other.  It's nearly impossible to find a male or female who agree' with you @PERCENT1, unless there pretending to be something there not.  From life experiences from parents arguing, friends fighting, and other relatives you see people forgive and forget so easily because the world is supposed to gifted and cherished everyday.     All in all I believe that most books are based off of reality and other peoples visions on the world and what they see.  I also find it interesting when people are very dramatic when trying to get there point across.  It helps others get a clear picture of who and what they go through."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3048	2	"I believe that all the books are meant to be in the library. People would not want them gone if they thought of it the way I do. It makes sense that we need all sorts of books to learn from. Some books @MONTH1 seem bad, but when you think about it there is always a good lesson to be learned. There are many different reasons why all books should stay on the shelf, but here are a couple of mine.     Two years ago there was a boy named @PERSON1. On many occations he found himself in bad situations that he did not know how to deal with. Many parents do not talk to their kids about certain things, such as drugs. This makes kids unaware and curious to figure out the truth. He had no other way of figuring out about how to handle fights, drugs, and alcohol unless he read about them in a book.      When he was almost sixteen years old he began to hang out with a bad group of teenagers. They were going to take @PERSON1 to a party. @PERSON1 secretly left his house and went because he was curious. When he got to the party, everybody began to drink. He knew that he always wanted to try it, yet he was not going to because he had to be home before his parents got up at five the next morning.      After several hours of setting on a couch watching everybody else do it, they finally had him talked into it. He figured that one would not hurt. Well before long, one became two, two became four, and it just kept going up. @PERSON1 was having so much fun that he lost track of time. He looked at the clock and it was three a.m., he got really worried.     He didn't know what to do until he thought back to a book he read. The book was about a guy who was out drinking, the guy had know other way home than to drive. The guy decided he would just drive home because he was not very drunk. When he was driving home he pulled out on a highway at the wrong time. A semi hit him in the left side of his car.       After thinking about that book he decided to be brave and call his parents. @PERSON1 knew that he would get punished, but he decided that grounding would be better than injury, or even death. @PERSON1 had his dad come get him from the party. He was grounded for two months. It would have been longer if his parents had not been so proud of his decision in the end. @PERSON1 was happy with his decision as well.     Events such as that are the exact reason why I think that almost any book belongs on the shelf. The story in wach book helps everybody comprehend what should be done in a real life situations. I know that books help me figure out many things. Even what to do and what not to do. If you just give every book a chance you will find a good reason for it to be read"	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
3049	2	"Do I think that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be romoved from shelves if they are found offensive? Yes, I think they should be romoved from the shevles if they are found offensive to some or the majority of people. Some can be a bad influence on younger kids. Some can be offensive to someone's race or religion. It could also be offensive to people based on who they are or what they do.                                                                                                                  Some materials should be romoved because of the kind of infuence they have on younger kids. Some books can have violent language and actions in the book. Most magazines have inappropiate articles that they should not be reading or even looking at. The music nowadays are very explicit and do not need to be in hands of kids. Some parents don't even care about the music but it is one of the biggest influential things out. So that's one reason why certain books, music, and magazines should be romved from shelves.                                                                                                                                       There are a lot of music and movies that are very offensive to certain races and religion. Hip @CAPS1 is one of the most explicit kinds of music and is very offensive to all kinds of religion and some race of people. Movies are the same with music. Magazines have certain articles that are racist and certain articles that are very offensive to certain religions.                                                                                                                 A lot of magazines have stories about celebreties that are very bad, sad, and private. In the past there have been some celebreties that sued some magazines and newspapers that put the wrong story out or something too private out.                                                                                                               Those are just some ways and reasons why certain books, movies, music and magazines should be removes from shelves if they are found offensive. No one knows how people feel abouit themselves or things around them"	4	3		4	3	4	3																		
3070	2	"Libraries are very educational. They provide books, movies, magazines, music, and computers for you to locate something you are looking for. I dont think that libraries include anything offensive. If anyone finds anything that a library has that is offensive to them, then they should talk to someone who works there and see if they can come to a solution. It shouldnt be removed because not everyone @MONTH1 find it offensive.          I've been to many libraries in my life and personally, it's amazing all the books, and things for you do there. I've actually gained alot of knowledge at the libraries i've been to because i found so many books that were just amazing. Never, have i ran into something that was offensive to me or anyone else. Everyone is different though, we have all have a different view on things and we all are unique. If a library does have something that's offensive to everyone then maybe it should be removed but like i said earlier if it's not offensive to everyone then it shouldnt be removed.           I personally, think libraries hold so many unique things that if somethings were offensive to people then i'd understand why everyone would want it to be removed. If someone came up to me and said 'hey, i find this music to be very inappropriate for young children to listen to' i would say, 'well, that @MONTH1 be true, but some children do listen to that music, it wouldnt be fair to remove it, just because one person doesn't like it. Now, from my experience theres alot of things that people find offensive but personally, i think it would be outside of a library"	3	3		3	3	4	3																		
3071	2	"Definately not, they @MONTH1 be offensive to some but not all. Everybody will be projected to offensive material sometime in their life, so their is no real reason to censor materials. These materials are made to entertain someone, some are entertained by offensive material. I honestly dont think that anything in the library is so offensive that it needs to be took out.      If any material offends you, you dont have to acknowledge it, you can always check out different material. If censor material then you are going against the first amendment, @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. Everyone will find something offensive about a certain material and demand it gets taken off the shelf or censored, what happens when every book has been marked as offensive? We have no books, thats what.          Books are made by the author writing down his idea's and creating a plot, some will think his idea's are offensive but not all will. Whether people think its offensive or not people still enjoy those books. Anyone can create material and share their idea's, those idea's could still be offensive but it doesnt matter, because we have @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 to say whatever we want and to not be prosecuted by it. If you ban any type of material, your prosecuting the voice of the creator's opinions, then all your doing is denying the @NUM1 amendment & being a hypocrite.      Censorship of music and movies is not right either. When you censor movies and music your also censoring out their idea's. Music is an expression of life and censoring that would be like censoring emotion. Censorship of the movies, music, & books is just prohibiting the expansion of culture. All im saying is censorship is destroying america and hurting our progression in culture."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3073	2	"What are we hiding from? Is personal expression really that bad? Questions such as these come to mind when the topic of censorship in libraries arises. In my own personal opinion I believe forbidding works of art from libraries is the same as destroying the people @CAPS1 created them. Censorship in general is a way to hide reality and sugar coat the struggles within life itself. One can not learn unless given the oppurtunity to face the problems in society and the world. By banning certain pieces, the world destroys an opportunity to expand the knowledge of every individual.      With the removal of materials such as books and music, libraries ruin the time spent and heart that the creators have placed trustfully within them. Although most people use these materials strictly for entertainment, the writers and musicians created them for self expression and to show their pain and struggles. It could even be said that expression such as this is theraputic for these specific individuals. How would you react if your form of art was dibbed unsuitable for a public audience? Would you be hurt and taken back? Many artists probably feel that they are being placed in a state of seclusion and hatred. With the creation of art there is always a deeper meaning behind them. The biggest question in my eyes is, ' @CAPS1 deems that material as unsuitable for libraries'? What can be so wrong with specific material that we must take it away from everyone? At the pace our world is going today their will be no individualism left within the next fifty years. If people are not even allowed to listen to specific types of music, sooner or later people won't be able to wear certain types of clothes or even dye their hair a different color. The human population's greatest gift is their ability to be different. If our society cannot even handle freedom of expression through art, how can it handle any other type?     Libraries are created as a place to expand knowledge. If materials are censored how can anyone learn? Every individual has their own way of thinking and interpreting subjects. A book seen as entertainment and down-time reading to one person @MONTH1 be the very thing that strikes a world changing idea in the mind of another. A human's greatest idea comes strictly from the knowledge they have accumulated throughout their life time and off of their interests. If certain forms of art are censored individuals will never be able to find that form of interest in certain subjects. Everyone will strictly be forced to believe and learn the same things, restricting the world from the magical ideas one man could have formed with the information obtained from the art that had been censored. In a discussion based class I previously took, we read an article discussing the @ORGANIZATION1's decision to ban any information related to the loss of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and the terrible things their society had done in their attempt of complete succesion from the @LOCATION1. Through ideas such as this, you are not only taking knowledge, but also implanting lies into the heads of the next generation. In that specific situation in the @ORGANIZATION1 it created a hatred and false sense of the @CAPS4 in the childrens' eyes. How can one specifically influence the beliefs of a child @CAPS1 is only @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old based off of their personal selfish beliefs? Through censorship we are destroying the truth and knowledge that each individual deserves if they are determined to find it.      The biggest thing about censorship is the cover up of reality. Do libraries think if they do not publically display a controlversial topic no one will know about it? Knowledge is all around us. No one needs a book to tell you our world is not perfect. For all we know, a book censored could have saved millions of lives. I cannot fully grasp the concept in my head of hiding materials from the public. There will soon come a time where expression at all will be censored. If we are getting rid of art should we remove people too? I can relate censoring books to censoring people based on my own personal experience. A teacher once told me that I would not ever achieve my career, because I had piercings. Opinions such as these could kill a person's dreams. I have known that I wanted to be a lawyer since I was seven years old and have been working to better my education based on my goals. How can you tell someone that they are not good enough based on your specific beliefs? There will always be something in the world you do not like. Each library @MONTH1 decided to censor a different type of art from their individual location. Eventually the world will have no art left, because those few people chose that it was not suitable for everyone. I can almost guarentee that most individuals have lived through worse experiences than what are being covered up. The world cannot be sugar coated or portrayed as perfect, because that is not lfe. Everyone will struggle at some point and its works of art that really get us through it. Sometimes we relate to them or in my case art such as music is what makes me feel better when I am hurt. The pain will always be there. Going through reality and the struggles is what makes each individual @CAPS1 they are. Censorship in libraries will not hide anything from the public, it will just destroy an oppurtunity to grow.     Censorship in libraries is what will destroy our world. No individual can say that material is not suited for the public, because they are not the public. Every person poses their own opinions on life. By banning these works of art you are banning individuality as a whole. If things like this continue our planet will become mindless zombies will no personal opinions. Libraries will be taking knowledge from everyone and ruin the chances for greatness for many people. There is no true way to hide reality from the world. Let people display their feelings through their art and share it with the world. The struggles of one person @MONTH1 be what saves another and allows the ideals of the world as a whole to grow"	4	5		4	4	4	4																		
3083	2	"Do you believe that certain things need to be taken off the shelf that's uncensored for my children to see.No, I honestly do not because the library shouldn't have no uncensored things put up on the shelves that our children might not see.Cause the staff shouldn't let the children in that area without a parent were the uncensored books, magazines, movies, music and etc.      But it's know ones fault because the media staff that works in the library shoudn't allow the younger kids to go in that area were those things are unless their guardian are with them. Unless they allow them in the area were the books, movies, magazines, etc.The kids should have a certain part of the library were they can take books from that's inappropiate for them.     There's alot of books that children shouldn't be able to read but they read anyways without adults permission.And yes their some books,that's not inappropiate for the little ones and the big kids.Thing's like that is offensive toward the parents how the staff just let them read in see things like that in the parents wonder why, an how there children learning things like that.     Certain things should be posted for things that kids shouldn't be able to see an read and do.And yes I have the right to say something to the staff for letting my child read, see things their not suppose to see.They know those things not appropiate for them so why would they let them watch or do or see stuff like that.     My conclusion yes I think certain things that don't suppose to be were they suppose to be for young children to see.That's not right to let them see things like that. So that's why I'm writing this essay to the newspaper arguing on whats right for allowing them to see uncensored things they are not to see"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3084	2	"Do you believe certain books should be removed from the shelf because they are offensive? From my point of view yes, because libraries are public which means they are open to any and everyone. Kids could see a photo that @MONTH1 not be appropriate for them, people of different religion could hear foul language, and it could give some libraries a bad image. I can relate to this because I have also heard some things that I am not proud of such as foul language. That effected me because when I heard it I went around people who were positive in my life saying it to them.     Of course, this could effect a child in a negative way. Kids grow up to be as positive as they can, atleast thats what parents teach them and if they get hooked on things they see they will try to immitate it. From my experience it did not turn out so good because my mother believed in physical discipline. But if a child is not taught that those things have bad effects they will learn the hard way. This is a reason I wish censorship was in our local libraries.     Also, people of different religion could find it offensive. We have different consumers that walk in and out of the library everyday, so when they enter they should find it peacful not the opposite. For example a muslim could walk in the library and here others listening into music with nothing but profanity. Now that person has the right to report that person who was listening to it and he can say the library has no restrictions. At times it is okay to want a book that has a few bad words but the library needs to know their limits.     Then, the library has a bad image which is a big problem. When something gets a bad look sooner or later it will not be there anymore. Meaning consumers will stop going to that library and one thing could lead to another. For example when you leave the library the people that work there want you to come back and tell other people about their library. But if problems constantly happen there they will leave and tell their friends this is not a good library. Then those figures add up then finally you struck out and it's gone.          Now, if they are not removed this is what can happen. Children will immitate what they see or heard, complaints will be filed on that library. If I had a problem with the restriction levels at the library I just would stop going. And if that library can not help it atleast have the courtesy to mark the sections of the library. This will make sure we will know what we are about to see and read"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3090	2	"They were talking about thinking of a book that no one should take off the shelf. But if the author had the right to remove the book from the shelf - that work I abhor, then everyone else should have the same right to remove the book from the shelf. But then, they would have no books left on the book shelf for any of them to read. They think that they should get some books that are not found offensive. This is what they should do about books that are found offensive.     If kids were reading books that the author found offensive, they should get rid of them. The books that were found offensive should not be read at all. Books that are found offensive are really bad for you to read. Offensive books should not be anywhere you are at. If you are going to read a book, do not get a book that is offensive.     Non-offensive books like @CAPS1, those kinds of books are not very offensive. If books were not offensive, people would read them very often. If people were to read books very often, there would not be enough @CAPS1 to do anything else. We do not deserve offensive books that have bad things in them. People deserve to have better and not offensive books.     Every day we read books, but do we know if they are offensive. If we did not know about the books we are reading were offensive, then we would be saying things right out of the book that we should not be saying. If we say stuff right out of the offensive book, we would get in severe trouble. Getting in trouble can mean some serious punishment. When you get punished, it could cause you to lose something for a certain amount of @CAPS1.     In conclusion, you understand what you can and cannot read. You also understand about what to do with offensive books. That non-offensive books can make you learn something. You can also understand about what happens when you say bad things out of the offensive books. And that you can end up losing something for a certain amount of @CAPS1."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3091	2	"The way that the books, musics ,ect. are made for people basicly for that age group. Like if that particular book contains profanity that some find offensive, then they should ignore that book and move on to the other book that is more fitting for that person rather than starting a controversy over that just of one book. Some stuff will have lables on them like parental guidence to show that only particular age person can have. From my experience is that it's ok, but if it gets out of hand then I just leave it and go to the next thing. Although rmoving the books from most people might not help alot because some people would like to have that book that they won't find anywhere else. The librarians can put that particular book in the older age section of the library and have the kids book in the younger section of the library. So hopefully this might help the problem that you might have for people to enjoy that books, music, magazine, ect."	2	2		2	2	2	2

I don't think that there is any books etc, that i would take off the shelfs. There are many books etc that kids should read, but you can tell your kids not to read them, or if they do start to read them take the book away from them.      There are some books that kids shouldn't read, but only you can stop them from reading them. They willl always try to find away to get what they want. so taking books off the shelf wouldn't do any good, because they'll find the book movie ets somehow. The only way to make such is to keep your kids over watch, and to make such they do son't the stuff you don't want them to do.         In conculusion taking books off the shlef would't help anyone out, but just try to keep your kids away from the stuff you  don't want them to be around"	3	2		3	3	2	3																		
3094	2	"Books, music, movies, and much more, being removed off  of the self because no one liked them and find some of them offensive does not not mean to get rid of them. Many enjoy them, and could use them for shool research or topics for a class.     First of all I know for a fact that some of the music my friends and I listen to would bother many other people, it was clearly our chioce to buy the music, book, or movie. We all have different opinions on what 'good' music or movies are. I can understand why some people would want us to get rid of it because of the foul language or racial slurs, but it is our money and our decision to buy it. Many teens take the music thing out of control and turn it up so loud that it will let @LOCATION1 hear it and with all the word and comments then make in the music I can see why adults don't want us to buy it. In respect for others I think we can turn down the radio, don't make comments to movies, and don't be immature with the books.      Second, All the research and studying we have to do in school, it would be pointless to not be able to have books or magazines to do our research with. Now a days the students get to pick what they want to do a topic over and if they want to do that topic bad enough then I am pretty sure they have the material to look up the information on that subject.      I do realize that it gets out of control with the music, movies, magazines, and books but we know when to settle down and grow up. Teens who are going to be immature about it does not deserve to have all those things. We just have to learn to use it with respect. Just getting them taken off the shelf would not be a good idea because some kids would actually use them for school believe it or not"	4	3		4	3	4	3																		
3096	2	"I belive that they need to keep every thing and gain more. Their is so much to luearn about. The more information you have the better. I for one think that they need to put more magazines on the stands so you can have more information. Thow you can not trust every thing in one, You can still find many facts about what your wanting to learn about. On the other hand, Children should not be able to reach or see some of this. I could teach our children stuff that they are not yet ready to learn about. The fact is they need to have people watching the stuff so kids wont get in it and we can still lurean and find out new things. Not everything should be hidden. The more you know could just save the world."	1	1		1	2	2	2																		
3100	2	"I strongly disagree.I think that materials should don't  be removed from the library.@CAPS1 all the materials are part of the library and for the school and for us too.All the materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, cd's. should don't be removed from the library.I got my own reasons that materials should don't be remove from the shelf. like sometimes i don't found any interesting things to do, so i go to my tiny library that i got in my house and i pick any book that i like.But when i don't like or i don't find any interesting book in my house, i go to the library to find  some intresting  books.But when the libraries or the school got offensive books, magazines, movies, ect., i think that offensive stuff shoul be remove from the library,@CAPS1 is not good for the children's, like when they want to read a book, like cartoon or animal book, and they don't find what they want they are going to get mad. And what about the parents the parents if they need to found some information about a book, or they just wanted to read and they found offensive stuff, the parents are going to get mad, not all the parents right but some parent will.and they maybe are not going to came back again.I never experience something like this in my life @CAPS1 in my school and the library that i go they don't have anything offensive or inapropiated. that's why a respect the people for the library and for the school, @CAPS1 they respec us too. tha's why i never go to places that i don't know.Supose i go to a library that i don't know and i bring my parent and my little brother right and this library have offensive materials, my parents are going to get mad with me, they are going to said that if i don't have respec, and that i bring my brother to a innapropiated place they are going to be mad with me, that i bring my family to a offensive place, and is not my foul right.And those are my opinions why"	3	3		3	3	2	3																		
3102	2	"Picture yourself walking through the library with your child. Now think of how hard you worked to teach your child respect and manners. Imagine all of those values going down the drain by them reading one bad magazine or listening to one explicit song.      I agree with the censorship in libraries today. Most people wonder where their children learn curse words or sexual behavior and do not consider media as the problem. Libraries have continued to keep children areas clean of explicit materials and are careful so that magazines such as '@CAPS1' do not reach their shelves.     Explicit material should be removed if it is found offensive. I have seen offensive material get into the wrong hands such as kids. That childish innocence disappears when they hear songs about money, sex, and abuse. Some books could give them the wrong idea and encourage them to make unlawful decisions. One example is a teen pregnancy book. The ideas in the book are either to keep the baby and deal with the consquences or abort the baby and move on with life. Some media says to abort the baby just because it is easier. Would you want your child to have the idea in their head that they should react first before they think?     In conclusion, censorship should be kept in libraries. It helps everyone altogether not to worry about what wrong things their kids are doing, or how they snatched the wrong idea. Please help us promote censorship in libraries to make a more respectful environment."	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
3106	2	"The library is a place of learning, discovery, and knowledge, available to anyone willing to take the time to engross themselves in the rows and rows of information. Including children's books, novels for young adults, @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON2, music, and movies, the library gives us a magnitude of opportunities to discover something we didn't know before. Although, there are other things that can be found in the library as well. Books including racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments can accidentally be stumbled upon while searching for something else. A parent should not have to worry about their child coming across a book or magazine containing inappropriate things such as this. I believe that offensive books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves of our libraries.      I would like to being by saying that I have an extreme issue with books that include comments, remarks, or names referring to people of a certain race. Imagine if an @CAPS1 @CAPS2 woman brought her daughter of @NUM1 years into the library to find information about a school project. Instead of finding the birth date of @PERSON1, she found a book making fun of @CAPS1 @CAPS4 and calling them inappropriate names. Children should not have to come across a discovery like that in a public facility, where fun and interesting facts should be found; not racial slurs. This type of event could cause serious damage on a child emotionally and mentally. That is why these types of things should be taken off the shelves immediately!     Another issue I have is with sexual content being found in libraries. I do understand that several books contain some sort of sexual content, but I am speaking of a novel describing a sex scene in extreme detail, or images of almost naked women on the cover. If someone is searching for a book of that kind, they can travel to a sex store somewhere nearby and get their fix of sexual reading pleasure. That type of book, however, should not be found in the library. It makes our society look bad and taints our places of knowledge.      Lastly, I would like to express how I feel about offensive religious comments being found in libraries. Every human in the @LOCATION1 is entitled to their own choice of religion. They @MONTH1 practice it freely, which is sadly not the case for others in different countries. If we have an uncommom right such as freedom of religion, then why would we put books in our libraries that include rude comments towards different religions. A @CAPS5 woman should not have to go to a library and come across a book stating her religion is an waste and stupid. This is not the truth, and it should not be in our libraries!      Even though I feel this way about inappropriate books, I understand there has to be some sort of limit when it comes to censorship. Many people fear once we start removing certain books from libraries, more and more books will be taken from the public until almost all our libraries are empty. Yes, if we do not censor within certain limits, this could happen. This is not what I want to happen though. I simply want the people of this community to stop and consider what is easily available for our children to obtain. The least we can do, as parents, is to take books, movies, magazines, and music containing racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments out of the libraries"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3110	2	"Do I think that certain materials such asd books, music, movies,magazines,etc., should be removed froom libraries, no, because people might need to know a certain information, certain lessons are taught in different sources, all sources are liabilities.     Now, you just @MONTH1 need certain information, and in those sources there are an unnumbered amount of lessons to learn. For example if were to go in a library an need a book on religion I would need a book or movie to teech me on that particular subject, or even sex I would need a magazine or move to watch to know new information.     There are different lessons taght in different aspects. For example some people learn by example, movies, music, and magzines. I it were to be me lokking for a source on music theory I might need one of those things to get what i need.     Finally, those things are liabillities. Don't get me wrong like we need them on a daily bases, but in a sense we sort of do. We use search engines for everything, everyday. so what do you think.     In conclusion i believe we need those sources because, someone @MONTH1 need certain information, there are diffferent lessons learned and taught in different things, a lastly ALL sources are liabillities"	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
3125	2	"Libraries have tons of books from comedy all the way to violent.Some people like reading books about war and violence while others find it offencive. No matter what the book is about people have the choice to read them or not so why should libraries have to remove books that some might find offensive? They shouldn't! Every one has different views on ideas, and not everyone is alike. If all the books that were offencive to someone where takin off the shelf, there would be no more books left.     People walk into the library and most of the time books are labled by what they are about. They walk to the section they like and pick out a book and normaly don't go to the section that they don't like. There is no reason to go to the section that they dont like becasue they wont be reading a book from there becasue they dont like it. They would just cause problems and disturb the ones that do enjoy reading those types of books. People have the choice to read a book or not so why bother even worry what other people are reading as long as they are happy with what thye have. If a parent does not want a child to read a certain type of book that is their buisness but other parents might want their child to soo what all is out there and develope their child's views on subjects.     Everyone has different views and ideas. If every one was the same the world would be boring and there would be notheing to talk about. By reading different types of books and listening to different types of music there is always somthing to talk about becasue not everyone knows the same subjects. Reading a new kind of book might even open people's eyes to what differences there are in the world. Children often times are more open to different ideas than adults are so if the books are not there for children to try and read they will never know what they like and do not like. A book a child likes @MONTH1 not be that a nother child likes or even an adult likes but that is normal, people are not the same.      If everyone took the books or music off the self that they found offensive there wouldn't be very much of anything left on the shelves. Styles are most the time oppisits, like comedy and sad books. Most poeple who would like comedy wouldn't like sad and visa-versa there fore they would take the other off the shelf so neither would have anything to read or listen to. Even with some of the best selling books poeple wonder why or how so many sold but thats just how it is. People out there like the book so if one person didnt like it all those people would never have known what that book is about and @MONTH1 have changed their life. Books can be very impactfull in people's lives and if they never read that book the change would never have been made to their life.The world goes round becasue of differences and the world becomes a better place because of different ideas. everyone cannot be the same it just would not work.      Libraries should not have to take books off the shelf just because someone found it offensive or did not like it. People have the choice to read books or not and different views and ideas are good to make things more interesting. Moreover, if everyone tooks books and music off the shelves they did not like there would not be very many books and music left. So if you run into a book or some music you dont like just ignore it, dont read it or listen to it. Things will be much simpler in the long run."	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
3131	2	"Libraries are sometimes connotated as very boring. Walking up and down isles looking at all of the books, and wishing that they were all more interesting. Minutes after searching through the one shelf you have been rummaging through for what seems like hours, you get a glimpse of a very interesting title. Inside of this book could be countless inappropriate pictures and profanity on every page. Who is to blame for opening the book and reading it?     Profanity, nudity, and crude humor, as well as many other things, are all over the media, including books. Some parents try very hard to keep their children out of the way of those things by telling the child that they just simply cannot watch, listen to, or read certain things. The parents typically do not say why they are not letting their child see, hear, or read these things, other than, 'it is bad, and I said no.' If parents were to tell their child specifically why they were not supposed to be exposed to certain things, the child might not be so inclined to get involved in those things.     Not only should the parents teach their child why they should not be exposed to those things, but maybe they should be around when their kids have an opportunity to see things they shouldn't. And if a child is too young to see, hear, or read certain things, than they are far too young to be browsing a library or any other place where they are not properly guided by a parent.      Censorship, in my opinion, should not be done by libaries, movie producers, television programs, and record companies, it should be done by the parents of a child."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3135	2	"Okay, to me, people are way to moral in the modern world, i was taught that if you have a problem keep it to yourself. Most of everyone know that censorship is a big deal but it doesnt have to be. I know that somethings are a little, risque, but getting this our their quicker would be a better solution. Your probably asking yourself, how in the world can this be a 'better solution'? Lets talk about children and this content, if you get this out there quicker and subtlely, the children wont see the need to find out what it is at a later age. If that was to happen the conseqences could be fatal, such as; fines, misdemenors, respect, reputation, and even some time in jail. Tell the kids about murder, drugs, sex, and crimes in general, they are twice as moldable then as they are when they are older. Taking them off our shelves will only make us a nicer community, yea i know what your thinking, why not do that? If more people in your community are nicer, when a real threat comes, whos gonna help? The @CAPS1? who knows, it takes a little bit for a squad car to get around, even longer if your in a city. In that time, some one could have died, been robbed and that same criminal gone. So, if we let this stay out on the shelves and so on, people will have the knowledge to see that using these to help people can be benifical. Anyways, what im trying to say is, if you take this away from us, people will become weaker, if you let it stay, people will learn from it and use it for good"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3140	2	"I think that removing books from a library that are offensive shouldn't be allowed, first off because people have different taste on the books they read. I also think that the books that the libary carries are educational, they might be offensive to people but sometimes they are good for learning new things about the world around us. Another thing is that a lot of books, movies, music, and magazines might be offensive to you, but if you dont want your child to read those then just keep them away from those types of books at the library, and the people that do want to look at that stuff can. So i think it just depends on what kind of stuff people like, everyone likes something different.      One reason why i think that libraries shouldn't be censored is because some people have different taste in the books they read. Some people like scary books, some people like romantic, so  everyone doesnt all like the same thing. Everyone might be offended of something but people should't let it bother them.      My second reason is because books that they carry at the library are usually educational. They have learner books for the little kids to help them learn how to read, they have magazines for the people that are interested in the drama around the world, then we have war books for the people that are interested in history, so i dont think that people should really be to offended by the books that people read.      Another reason is that if you dont want your child or a looking at the books or ect. That might look offensive to you then dont let them read them, everyone likes different things, and if you take away things that other people like then your just offendending them too. Thats why people that enjoy to go to the library should't take things so offensive, so we don't have to censor things at the library.     So thats why i think that libraries shouldn't have to be censored at all because people have different taste in the books that they read, that books that libraries carry are usually educational, and if you don't want your child looking at those kind of books then don't let them read them. People need to undrstand that some books aren't always trying to offend people, but the ones that are they are just trying to state there own optinon"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3146	2	Should certain books be banned or shouldn't certain books be banned? In my own personal opinion no I don't think that any books should be banned from a public libaray.     The authors of books have freedom of speech so yeah some books @MONTH1 offend people but if it offends them they should try stay away from that books or magazines. I think that if certain books get banned from the libaray then you won't be able to buy them in stores anymore because the stores will banned them as well.     In my personal opinion no I don't think that any book should be banned from the public library. The reason being is because you can't judge a book by it's cover. You don't know if the book is goin to offend you until you read it. After you read it or you'r in the middle of reading it and it offends you you should take it back to the library and get a new one.     Should certain books be banned or shouldn't certain books be banned? In my own personal opinion no I don't think that books should be banned from the public library. Because alot of books that do offend people are the one's that teach us about history.	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
3151	2	"The entertainment for children and adults consists of movies, music, sports, video games, and reading. Books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from any shelf at any time. Libraries censor some material because of violence or inappropriate material. Children should have the right to read, listen, or watch whatever they want to because it's their life. Books, magazines, music, and movies can teach young people about life and the writers, artists, directors, and actors have worked extremely hard on entertaining the people..      The materials found 'offensive' should not be removed. These materials can be found helpful to others. Reading material can help a young person with life. If the reader is having problems and needs help, it is possible the book he/she is reading @MONTH1 help them in the thinking process on what they should do. The books, movies, and music have been made by extremely hard workers, so why take away their hard work by removing their material just because a couple of people have found it offensive.      One of the many times i went to the library I was looking for a book I had read before but I could not find it. I could not find it because someone else found it inappropriate and had asked that the book be removed from the shelf. This hurt me because that book was one of my favorite books to read. Some books found 'offensive' or 'inappropriate' and taken off the shelves could be another person's favorite book to read. Why take it off the shelf? People are being too much self-centered. They care about themself and that is it.      The material being taken off the shelves should be put back on the shelves for the readers who find the material entertaining. If a parent does not want their child reading a certain book then they have the authority to take the book away from that child, not the shelves. Freedom of the @CAPS1 states that the anybody has the right to write whatever the he/she wants to write.  If we keep taking books, magazines, music, or movies off of the shelves then we're going to get to the point to where there are no books on any shelf"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3157	2	"If something is to be found offensive, than it should certainly be removed from the shelves. When parents send or take their children to a library, they do not expect their child to be able to pick up something that is not appropriate. Some items @MONTH1 offend someone's beliefs and be rude. Public libraries are just that, public. Everything there will be seen by the public and large masses of people. No one should have to worry about being offended when they walk into a place of learning and knowledge.     Parents do not want their child going to the library and picking up rude materials. Even if the child does not check the book or magazine out, who is to stop that young, impressionable mind from flipping through the pages. Perhaps he or she reads something that his or her parents did not intend on teaching them for some time. Books now have a lot of crude text and humor. If there is a topic that a younger individual is not mature enough to understand, he or she @MONTH1 get the wrong impression or ideas about the subject.      If a kid is rumaging through the more adult section of the library, they might be expossed to some information they are not ready for. Offensive language @MONTH1 be present in the books and now the young person will see them and try to use the words or phrases. If a child read something about sex, he or she might be curious or confused, and ask their parents about it. The parents on the other hand, might not have wanted their child to know about the topic at such a young age. At that point there would be no turning back. Parents would have to explain things that are too mature for some young minds.     Parents have every right to deny minors and children certain materials, but if the books are out in open, who will censor what is looked at by whom. Libraries need to put serious thought into what is on the shelves, no matter what form the information is in. People @MONTH1 think just because the story was in a book, than of course it can't be real. Some reckless senarios are played out in movies. Those movies are watched by people of all ages. If an impressionable teenager watches a movies that has offensive language or violent scenes, that teen might act upon what they've seen.     Since the public library is indeed public, the materials it offers to people should not be offensive. All sorts of individuals walk into a library and look around. No one should ever walk out a library with the feeling of being offended. No parent should have to worry about what their child might pick up. Libraries should not cause worry or harm in any way."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3162	2	"Censorship is one of the most broken laws in @LOCATION1.  It is illegal to censor any publication such as books, magazines, music or movies.  Censorship most often occurs with books in a school setting.  Censorship should no longer be tolerated because it affects the writers, school system and escpecially readers.       In the @ORGANIZATION1 every person has the right to express their feelings and opinions on any topic that they want to.  School systems are taking away that right by not allowing them to have a certain book in a school.  Schools should be a place for either all books or a place for no books at all.  The faculty of a school does not have the right to decide what books are allowed in their school based on their own ideals.  It is not fair to the writer to be descriminated agianst, and that writer must have the right to have their book read in any setting.       The next group that censorship within a school system affects is the school system itself.  If a school is allowed to take away one right of a group of people without punishment, then they might start taking away other rights.  In general school systems and teachers are power hugnry leaders of the student body of a school.  They make rules just to display their power over students, and take away many of their rights.  If schools are allowed to continue censoring books, then this could lead to a downward spiral of all being censored.  As Katherine Paterson once said,'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children...take off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove the book I abhor...then you have exactly the same right...And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  The government of the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to crack down on school censorship because it is unconstitutional.       The last major group of people that censorship within a school system is the potential readers and students.  Censoring a book is taking that persons ability to learn about, and understand a certain topic that was censored.  Students within a school must have the right to read what they want to read regardless of the schools beliefs and ideals.       In conclusion, censorship in any setting, but escpecially in school must no longer be tolerated because it affects writers, school systems, and potential readers.  Schools are taking away the constitutional right of all potential readers.  The government of the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to crack down on the unlawful practices occuring in schools, around the country, everyday"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3163	2	"What is this world coming to?  We have stooped to the level of installing offensive materials in libraries where anyone can check them out. Being a daughter and teenager myself, I personally have had the experience of reading some of these offensive books and magazines.  The sex, drugs, and violence used to create a story, have destroyed the minds of our youth.  I strongly feel this disturing and destructive material should be removed from the shelves of libraries.          I do not question whether children and teens should read, but rather what they read.  I agree reading helps our youth learn and excel in schooling, but offensive books and magazines put nasty ideas into their minds and distort their way of thinking.  The more our younger generation reads about these ugly things, the more curious they become.  I feel they will eventually let curiousity get the better of them.      Many would say that experiencing activities such as sex and drugs is all apart of growing up, but I disagree.  Trying any one of these harmful activites portrayed in certain library materials could put you and your health in severe danger.  It only takes one time to become pregnant or become addicted to drugs.         To better prove my point, think of your favorite book.  Did you look up to any of the main characters? Did you want to be just like him/her?  Well it seems to me that this malicious material makes the main character and hero of the story a bad role model.  They @MONTH1 save the world and be a hero by day, but authors and producers make sure they include their night life in the story as well.  This tells our children that it is okay to do these things, when it is the exact opposite.     I stand by my opinion and believe offensive books, magazines, and movies should be removed from the shelves of libraries.  This material plants a bad seed in the mind of our youth.  It leads them to believe everyone, including their heros in books and movies, does these things.  Sex, violence, and drugs are not what this world was made for"	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
3171	2	"Our founding fathers creating amendments for the people.  One of the greatest is the freedom of speech.  Censorship of offessive materials is unnecessary.  Books, music, movies, and magazines @MONTH1 have bad messages or nudity, but that does not give anyone the right to get rid of them.  Book burning happened because of the dislike of people's writing.  People have the right to say how they feel by any medium.  Censorship of anything makes a child more immature.     Book burning is a horrible action by any person.  People used to burn them because of all the sex, drugs, and violence, but doing this destroys people's dreams, theories, and ideas.  In the book @CAPS1 @NUM1, firemen would burn any book seen within a home.  Almost ever single book in the world is not factual, unless it is nonfiction.  The firemen in the novel destroyed any bits of type because it was false and went against the government.  That basically means every kind of book out there.  The causation of such a tragedy was that every citizen befriended their television or video games.  Without books there would be no real sort of entertainment.  Also, the things we read everyday are what make us who we are so there, in fact, should not be less books but more.     Libraries have no right to censor books.  Freedom of speech has been around almost since the beginning of this nation.  Why should it change now?  Stopping obscene literature from being in the reach of the people is stopping writers from speaking out.  They @MONTH1 have already written their ideas, but if nobody reads their work then there is no way that they'll be heard.  Libraries are not there to stop things from reaching little kids' ears but to provide any knowledge a man needs.     Parents have always stopped their precious babies from watching certain shows and movies.  I once knew a woman who would never allow her son to watch the @PERSON1 series because of the use of sorcery.  She believed that he would try to learn witchcraft.  I found that quite ridiculous when I heard about it.  When a kid watches murder mysteries, fantasy shows, or dramas with bits of nudity, it is different to them and they are curious.  After watching these kind of scenes, a parent needs to sit down with their child and talk about what they jus saw.  The child needs to know that killing is wrong and justice is good and magic and dragons don't exist.  Nudity has always been considered a bad thing but penises and boobs are part of the human body.  Kids will be more mature about it the more they see it, but that doesn't the child should watch porn.     Censory has always been taken the wrong way.  People believe if that the offensive material is shown then the watcher or reader will have bad thoughts about what they learned about.  We should not get rid of the obscenity at all.  We should have an understanding of the bad things in life.  Burning books is a bad way to destroy the foundations of the human mind.  Freedom of speech is a law and should be followed.  Censorship is not always a good thing for children or anyone for that matter"	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
3175	2	"Libraries contain many different selections of books, music, and magazines. However, are all of these materials appropriate for all @CAPS1 visitors? In this essay I will explain to you why I think offensive, distracting and inappropraite material should be removed off of the shelves, and put into their own section of public @CAPS2.     If a small child were to walk into a public @CAPS1 and pick up a book about abortions, they would not know what the book is talking about, because most small children cannot read. What if a fifth grader was to pick that same book up? They would be able to read  the whole thing with no problems. However, should a fifth grader be allowed to pick up a book about abortions at such a young age? I dont think so, fifth graders should be reading age appropriate books. This is just one reason why I think offensive, distracting and inappropriate material should be moved to its own section of the @CAPS1.     When I think of a @CAPS1 I think of a quiet place that I can go to and read, or study. Although, some Libraries allow their visitors to listen to music. Rather it be on a computer, on a ipod, or even on a cell phone, there should be a sound limit right? Most people would think that Libraries set sound limits, and they probably do, but people do not follow directions and they are not attentive to what other people are doing. It is @CAPS6 distracting to go into a @CAPS1, to study, and the person next to you has their ipod blasted to a heavy metal rock song. Once again, this is another reason I think offensive, distracting, and inappropriate material should be moved to its own area of the @CAPS1.     I also think that a @CAPS1 is a community place, that you can go to and be safe, and your parents would not have to go with you because they think that it is safe and appropriate too. Most Libraries have magazines, because its for your entertainment, and they want to keep you happy so you will keep coming back. Well not all magazines are rated @CAPS10, some have @CAPS6 inappropriate material in them. A child should be looking at magazines that are appropriate for children, a teenager should be looking at magazines that are for teenagers, and an adult should be looking at magazines for adults. However the adult magazines should not be showing people with barely any clothes on, or any sexual scenes, and neither should teenage magazines. With innapropriate magazines, I do not think they should have their own section of the @CAPS1, I think they should be removed all together. They have pictures in them and anyone can look at a picture.     I really hope you can understand my point of view. It is nothing against public Libraries, it is just the material inside of them. If I owned a public @CAPS1, I would have rooms devoted to books that are for different age groups. For example, I would have a room for @NUM1+, and a room for @NUM2+. Those rooms would be for the books that are easily questionable for younger children. I would also have my own room devoted for music only. That way anyone could go in the room and listen to whatever kind of music they want, no questions asked. The rest of the @CAPS1 would be for people to study, and read. I think every @CAPS1 should be like this, it would help make the world a better place"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3181	2	"The diversity of the world makes it rather difficult to please every person all of the time. What I find appropreate, another @MONTH1 find obscene and volgur. What I enjoy to read, or listen to, or watch, or any other manner of media consumption I indulge in, @MONTH1 insult or bother someone else; as a matter of fact it probably does. That still does not make it right to remove what I, or others like because it offends another person.     A child walks through a grocery store, doesn't get what they want and proceeds to drop the f-bomb. More than half the time, they heard that language from their parents. If not their parents, then the media right? Maybe so, but that media shouldn't be hidden for the 'just-in-case' a child hears it. If a parent or guardian does not want their child to hear such things, they shouldn't allow them to listen to it. They control what does and does not enter their house.      To remove such things from the library, would be like trying to keep a child from ever seeing a naked body, or hearing a curse word. Every time they bathe they'd need blinders from themselves and they'd never be able to leave their house, because people do not always watch what they say in public.      No, I do not feel like every type of movie, or book, etc., belongs in the library. There is a cut-off as to how inapropreate or volgure something should be and still be allowed in a public library. Novels that are so descriptive that the reader can almost see every aspect of the procreation taking place between the pages, should have its own place, seperate from the public library, right along with the movies that really do show every aspect.     Although I like the thought, to actually remove said books would be unfair. To deny access to those who find those books fine for themselves wouyld be wrong. A wise author, Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' The truth of this statement would not be hard to prove.      A religious family that believes @PERSON2, a book I find to be innocent fantasy, is a book series promoting witchcraft and satanism, so they remove them from the library. I remove the previously stated graphic romance novels. A mother whom wants her child to be sheltered from what she considers the filth of the planet, removes books of drug addicts, and abuse, and books of war because they're full of death. And as this continues, finally, we are left with the empty shelfs of a forgotten building that no longer has a purpose.      The graphic novels I find inapropreate could be placed in an adult section, or higher up than most children can reach. The protective parents can deny their own children the media they deem inappropreate, instead of the world.     Although not everything is appropreate for everyone, it isn't right to censor something from the world. There are ways to cencor things to parts and not others. Nothing should be romoved from the library because of its content. At most it should be placed in a less accessable manner."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3190	2	"I believe that they should not be pulled off of the shelf if they are found to be offensive. Many people have there own taste in what they like to read, write and do. Therefore, there should be a wide variety of these things on the shelfs so people can do what they enjoy best.     Books and magazines @MONTH1 be offensive, but they @MONTH1 also entice the reader. i personally love books about drugs, sex, and many other inappropriate things. In fact my favorite book is banned from my school library. If they took all inappropriate books out of they library. What would i read? not everything can be just peachy kin all the time. Its not in real life, so why should we have to read a little fantasy world that we know isnt true? I know i would'nt want to read that.      Just like books and magazines, every one has their own taste in music. some like country, classical, metal, and maybe even rock. If you took the songs that were offensive off the shelf that would make people angry. That's like not playing a song on the radio thats offensive, and many songs played on the radio are degradeing to women. if it can be played on the radio. Why cant it be in a library? there going to be able to listen to that song on the radio anyway.     Most movies these days are very gory or offensive in many aspects. Many people are interested in these movies. If you can watch that movie in a movie theatre, why cant you check it out of a library? Some people go to check out movies that are shown in school so they can watch it if they were absent. What would they do if that movie got taken off the shelf? Fail? I know i would become angry if that would happen to me.     Keep offensive books, music, movies, and magazines on the library shelfs. People will eventually see them, hear them, and watch them even if its not in the library. Even if you take out offensive materials there still going to get them sooner or later no matter what you do"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3191	2	"When have you ever went into a library and found a book that is so offensive that you complain or try to get that certain book off the shelf? Have you ever read a book half way through and questioned why you are reading it? Why would you read a book that you know you're not going to like?     If someone has the right and the authority to take books off the shelf that bothers them, then I have the exact same right as them. I thought everyone was treated by equal rights. When i ever do read I always read the back of the book or whats called the summary of the story so I can see if I'm going to like it or not. If I know a book is going to offend me or a magazine or even a movie, most likely I'm not going to even bother giving my attention to them.     Obviously the author doesnt like censorship or she wouldnt be arguing about it. It's obviously something that bothers her and everyone is intitiled to their own beliefs and disbeliefs. I respect people that stand up for themselves and find the hardest ways out of hard prediciments. I can say I always go to libraries and read books because I'm not a reader. But i can tell you if I ever did go to a library and i found a book on the shelf that offends me its probably going to offend someone else. So why would they even try to bother getting away with being offensive to people. Everyone is intitled to their own opinion. But i think if it's going to offend someone in praticular it's probably going to bother someone else. I'm not saying everyone is alike but most people believe in things that other people believe in. People can hav the same agreements and disagreements.     I do have to agree with @PERSON1 because she is right. You would be amazed on the amount and different things people can get offended by. I have tons of experiences of movies, books, music, and magazines that have offended me. But I didnt let it pull me down or anything. For example I stopped watching the movie, and I stopped reading the book that bothered me. You can't wear your emotions on your shoulders but you can stand up for your rights and tell people what you believe. @CAPS1't ever tell anyone that you can't believe in your opinions. If certain things offend you, @CAPS1't let them bother you just stop doing what your doing and move on to something else.     Like I said I have had alot of experiences of offensive things I have read and watched. Like awhile back I watched a movie that had a black man in it and he was locked in prison and killed in prison for being accused of something he didn't do. It was just because the time era and it was also because he was black. Thats the kind of stuff that really upsets me. Because we are all the same. We @MONTH1 look different and see things different. But our bodies function the same and we all breathe the same air. I have always gone by the saying, '@CAPS1't ever judge a book by it's cover until you read it.'     So whatever people @MONTH1 think I believe in one thing and it's to let people believe in things they want to believe in. @CAPS1't ever tell someone how to think, act, or feel. I agree with Katherine Paterson."	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
3192	2	"When I go to a library I @MONTH1 find some stuff that is offensive to me. But if somthing is offensive to me the person beside me @MONTH1 not  think the same thing  is offensive to him or her. When people try to put boundaries on what is offensive and what is not they can not . There is a wide variety of people that all have diffrent opinions based on their history.      What I think is offensive @MONTH1 be seen as the best thing that has ever been printed, published, or recorded and other people's eyes. The major problem is that offensive doesn't have a set definition. I don't think that you will ever find a definition that everyone can agree on. There needs to be a limitations to keep certain things away from certain age groups. For example you would not want a kindergarder to be able to check out a @CAPS1 movie.      Some censoring has to be done to protect people.But it all comes down to common sense. We won't ever all agree on what is offensive but if we use are common sense the problem @MONTH1 be solved"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3195	2	"Library Censorship     Everyone has their favorite book. But if it offended someone, should he be allowed to remove it? Offensive materials should not be removed from shelves. If we removed books that offended even one person, then no books would remain.     As americans, we have the right to freedom of speech. Authors use their freedom in their writing, just like musicians use their freedom to make music. But if we denied them their right to put out their creations, we would be denying them their basic rights as an american citizen.      Personally, I hate rap. I don't even consider it to be music, due to the fact that no one actually sings. But I do understand that a large percent of our population does enjoy listening to it. Should I be allowed to remove it from shelves, leaving teenagers without their music, denying artists' freedom of speech, and ultimately, leaving them unemployed?     One of my favorite series is the @PERSON2 series, by @PERSON1. It is about a young teenager who learns to deal with all the struggles of growning up by depending on @CAPS1, and it helped me do the same. But because it is a @CAPS2 series, should it be removed from shelves? Should other young girls be denied the chance to read this life-changing series, simply because someone might find it offensive?     Although some wish they could elimate certain materials that they find offensive, it isn't fair to the authors, musicians, or fans of those pieces of work. However, those who find it offensive should be allowed to avoid it. Libraries need to make sure they separate each topic distinctly, so people can easily tell where they should or shouldn't avoid. Libraries are suppost to be a resource for everyone, which means they need to have materials for everyone, even though they might seem offensive."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3199	2	"Do we have the right to take books? Author Katherine Paterson proves a point by saying 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is saying that if everyone is able to just remove books from the shelf because they have something agaist it then we would hardly have any books at our libraries.        Everyone has their own opinions. There are so many things that effect our opinions. Our beliefs, life styles, way of thinking, culture, and the list goes on. I'm sure I could think of certain books, movies, music, and magazines that I dont like and could just do without. Does that mean I want to totally rid the world of those certain materials? It sure wouldnt bother me but that would be extreamly selfish. Even if something is totally innopropriate and offensive it is still information. Maybe it shouldnt go in the little kids section of a library or store but i dont think it should be removed completely. Music especially. There are wide ranges of music from rap, rock, oldies, screamo, classical, country, alternative and the list goes on. I dispise country; I go for the alternative and classical music. I know a lot of people who love it though. All the old people i know hate all the rap. Most of it is pretty offensive but thats just how things are.         So no, I dont think anyone should have the right to remove anything from anywhere just because they personally find it offensive. We cant hide from the world. I think people should be open to new things and understand that not everyone likes the same things. If we remove thing materials we dont care for, others will remove the ones you like and so on. So then were left with nothing. Just like freedom of speech we should have the freedom to read, listen to, and watch what we enjoy"	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
3202	2	"Books that are found offensive should not be taken off of library shelves. Books tell stories fiction or non-fiction. Many books that @MONTH1 be found offensive are historical. These books could include topics such as wars, eras, people, ect. Everyone has the same rights to read any book they want. They also have the right to not read the book at all.      Books that are taken off the shelves of a library because of one person, or a group of people, being offended henders the ability of someone who wants to read the book, to read the book. We, as people, should not be able to take this right away from other people. They should be able to read anything they want. If someone wants to read a biography or history about @CAPS1, they should be able to.      The topic of @CAPS1 and the @ORGANIZATION1 @MONTH1 be found to be offensive because of what they stand for. If we look at the topic as purely a historical reference not as a story to be read for enjoyment there will never be any offence in these books. These stories have a large role in history. If we do not learn from their mistakes, history @MONTH1 repeat itself. History is around to be studied, even if the topics might be offensive to some people.     Political correctness can not always be followed when writing a story. Such as in To @CAPS3 a @CAPS4. This book has many issues when it comes to political correctness. These issues include; the killing of an innicent man and revealing the flaws in our judicial system, the use of the word 'nigger' to describe the black characters, and the racial unequality of the @LOCATION1 duringthe @DATE1's. These issues would deffinately be offensive to some readers, but this book is an award winner and uses history as a guide. The situations in this novel are ones that could be real. They are things we must learn about, so we do not repeat them.     Another story that fits quite well into this topic is @CAPS5 @NUM1. This novel is about a world where all books are burnt. No books are allowed to be read by the people. This book reveals the removal of offensive books to its exteme. No matter who you are or what you believe, there will be some topics that you find offensive. If we remove every book that someone finds offensive we will have no books on the shelves of any library. A library is not a library wihout its books.     If we allow books to begin to be removed from the shelves, we will not be able to stop it. One day we will end up like the world in @CAPS5 @NUM1. No history will be know but what is passed down. No more stories will be here to entertain us, but the ones memorized. No books will exzist and this world would be terrible without books.     Books that are found to be offensive should not be taken off of library shelves. The taking away of these books takes away the freedom to read anything you want. It reduces the chances we have to learn and to flourish. Political correctness should not take the place of our own freedom, and as long as we keep our books on their shelves, it won't"	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
3203	2	"I believe that libraries should have more cencorship. Some books, magazines, and movies should be removed or grouped by age. From my own experiences of reading or seeing people read these books, I believe they should be removed because they influence violence, sexual activity, and drug use. Young children should not be exposed to those things yet.     First, I think books that contain violence should be removed. I believe that children are the easiest people to influence. I also believe that violence is the worst thing to be influenced by. Violence in books can influence killing. Fighting and killing is not good. No young child should be able to check out about full of shooting and fighting. The book will make the kids think thats the right thing to do if they are able to check it out. Being influenced by violence will make you commit crimes. Reading a book is not worth going to jail for.     Next, I believe that all sexual activity material should be removed from libraries. Sexual activity should not be exposed to children until it is time for them to start learning about it. For example, a young girl reading about teen pregnacy not being a problem. The reader will think that is what she is suppsed to do which is wrong. Books and magazines containing sexually explicit words should not be able to be viewed by young children. Those thing @MONTH1 influence kids to do things they should not even be thinking about doing. You can atleast sort them all in an adult section.     Finally, drug use should not be issued in books to kids. children should not read or watch anything that are talking about drugs in a positive way. Unless it is about saying no to drugs and not using them, children should not read them at all. Drugs make people do things that their right mind don't want them to do. Children should say no to drugs and to books that are influencing the opposite.     In coclusion, that is why I believe that we need censorship in our libraries. we need censorship because of viloence and drug use. Also becuse of sexual activity and many more things"	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
3208	2	"If I could remove anything from shelves of libraries I wouldn't.  Would you rather your kids to learn things from the facts or learn from friends?  Censoring books, magazines, movies, etc and what goes onto the shelves are mostly for enjoyment or informational.  Granted you wouldn't want a five-year old reading a book made for adults, but with age kids would have to learn things.  You can't always control what children read unless you plan on going with them everywhere including college and on into their adult life.     Books provide facts and more reliable information than what  you can hear from people.  If all the books on the shelves relating to drugs or alcohol were pulled off, how would someone write a report on those things.  The books were created to provide people, kids especially, with facts that no one else could share and it could help with expanding their vocabulary and knowledge.  If someone were to find a book or a @CAPS1 offensive, they don't have to look at it or even pick it up.  Libraries can't always suit everyone's tastes and something you @MONTH1 find offensive isn't to others.  Takign a single book from the shelves would result in others taking books off the shelves and then no books would be left for anyone to read or wish to take off the shelves.     If you controlled what everyone read, no one would be happy and their brain wouldn't function correctly.  You'd be taking one of their rights, one of the only things entitled to them without someone else telling them they can't.  What kids read is shaping their minds for their future.  If you removed their favorite series or genre from the shelves, they wouldn't read or listen to music or anything anymore because it isn't enjoyable.  Kids get into reading when they can enjoy what they read or listen to.     So with that, I wouldn't take anything off the shelves because everything appeals to someone in one way or another.  Controlling what one person reads doesn't lead you nor the other person anywhere, someone could end up being offended if you take something you find offensive off the shelves, and you can't stop the knowledge that books can provide people if they read them.  In one way or another something provides information for people."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3210	2	"You gotta admit, although you would like your kids to have freedom, @CAPS3 all of them are responsible enough to handle @CAPS1. You could blabber in their ear all day about '@CAPS1's responsible to do this and @CAPS3 do this.' and they will go out and do @CAPS1 anyways. Trust me, I'm a teenager. I know. So there are certin things that you have to take away from them in order to keep them from getting distracted on what @CAPS2 matters in their teenage years. And that is schoolwork.     If school systems allowed there to be offensive or innapropriate materials on their shelves, I just know kids would find themselves to be...well... 'distracted'. And when I say innapropriate, I don't only mean on sexual terms, I mean for school. You would like to think that they would possibly save @CAPS1 for when they checked out and went home and did their work first but, like I stated before, kids are going to do what they want. And what they want to do is @PERCENT1 of the time @CAPS3 schoolwork. They would rather just sit down, crack open a magazine, and let their eyes glaze over at the sights of celebrities and new scandals.      School work is a very important thing in teenagers lives, and I feel that when they are in school they should stay focused on schoolwork and activities. If they wanted to have free time to go and read magazines, they should do @CAPS1 at home. Offensive books should @CAPS3 be there to only distract the teenager from school. @CAPS1's unneccesary. But with public libraries, @CAPS1's a whole new story.     I beleive that nothing should be censored from a public library because people go their on their own free will. I know I personaly go there for research and for the sheer joy of reading, as do many other people. @CAPS1's your choice if you are responsible enough to keep focused on work or get distracted because @CAPS3 only do teenagers go there, but adults do too. @CAPS1 is unacceptable for there to be only educational books because who knows what your there for? The library is for people to go and read, whether @CAPS1's just for the heck of @CAPS1 or for school.     @CAPS3 everyone is responsible. Especially @CAPS3 teenagers. So that's why I personally beleive offensive or innapropriate materials should @CAPS3 be allowed in school libraries, but allwowed in public libraries. Although equal rights and freedom in necessary, schoolwork is too important to let kids get distracted from @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is the key to their future"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3223	2	"There are different types of books, movies, magnazines, and tape recorders in libraries. Books can be fiction or nonfiction. However, books or any other items can be offensive to people but to others it is just a book to read. So therefore, libraries should not remove books or any other items from the shelf.      Who picks out the books, movies, magnazines, and tape recorders? The answer is the customers at the library. The authors of the books or items did not. The authors gave the decision to choice between books or items. No one can blame the authors. Also, there are different kinds and different types of writtters or artists. Writters and artists took their time for completing a novel or series for us to read or hear. People should not take it seriously about books or other source because it can be nonfiction are fiction.      My next example why libraries should not remove items off the shelf is it might offensed someone but not to others. For example slavery can offensed a colored person but to others it is just a historical event. People need to know what happened in the past with historical events. People need to read the introduction before checking out the book to know if they like it or not. Therefore, people should not try to remove it.                    If a child checks out a book and their parents let them, it is the parents fault. It is there fault because parents let their child check the items out. Also, if a person has a problem with books or any other sources then complain but the libraries should not remove it from the shelf. Like I said before, one person might not like the book or other source but another person might like it.           Libraries are for people to check out books or other sources, and not to remove books or other source off the shelves."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3224	2	"Why is censorship important in libraries? Why should we care if there is censorship at all? I am here to tell you today my views and opinions on cenership at the library.     When you walk into a library I assume you would expect a public area where you can read books and check them out, but what happends when you browse through these books and you find something offensive? How do you act, and what should you do? In my opinion censorship is alright but only used when needed. Censorship protects childeren and young adults from viewing things that are adult eyes only such as horror books, offensive music, and in most cases pornography. Censorship in the library is an important role because anyone can go into a library and pick up any book, but when you have and adults only section for books, movies, music etc. it stops alot of people to having to worry about there kids seeing bad things. For instance, if tweleve year old @PERSON1 goes into a library and finds a video game with large amounts of violence in it he can check it out and play the game without his parents knowledge of the incident. With censorship we eliminate such problems.     Now like I stated before censorship is ok when needed, because censorship can get carried away as well. In reality, its the parents fault of why there kids do things also like letting there kids listen to music with heavy swearing or full access to a personal computer. Things like that are creating problems for parents as well as people around them. When I say censorship is ok when needed I mean people censor important information on the account of a event that has happend in the past. Another example, if your in ninth grade and you enter a library for a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 movie but its to graphic the student is stranded for a source and must gain access to a computer.     Now that you have my opinions and beleifs you can get a better understanding of what I mean. Censorship is a good thing but it can also be a bad one as well. I think that if censorship is controlled correctly it can become a powerful tool in any library, school, and even home. Censorship is at times out of control but maintained we can use it for many things and have a great community as well as country.     In essence, Censorship is ok to and extent and you should beleive this as well just because if you think long enough you too can see what I see."	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
3225	2	"Some of the most interesting books that I have ever read are offensive in some way. I have even read excellent books that offend me. If we didn't have books and stories that offend us, then we would never really find out what offends us. That is why I don't think books, magazines, music, or anything of that nature that @MONTH1 be found offensive in some way should be remover from the shelves.     If you think about, almost all books can be offensive or hurt your feelings. It just depends on how you feel about what has been written. Something that is offensive to one person or a group of people @MONTH1 not be found offensive by another person or group of people. If we took all the books off of the shelves that someone said offended them, then there would be no books left.      Writing is something you do when you want to express how you feel, or tell a story about yourself or someone else. Some authors @MONTH1 do this in a very offensive manner. Others @MONTH1 try to suger-coat how they feel about a person or certain idea. Either way you could still find something about the writing to be offensive.     In conclusion, i feel that books that are found offensive or hurtful should be left on the shelves because, if we took all of them off, there would not be a very wide selection of books left"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3227	2	"Censorship in libraries in my view isn't a good idea. Library now days have alot of offensive language in there books so if someone were to take all of the book like that out of the library then library wouldn't even have that many books in it. Music is the same way all music now days might have some offensve words in them thats just something people now days have to get over.          I think library censorship is not a good idea. Some parent might not like the idea of there librarys haveing offensive language in the books, music, movies, and magazines. If the parent don't want there children to not read those book then they need to chose there childrens book, but I think takeing all the offensive book of the shelves isn't very smart. Some people enjoy reading and listening to that kind of music.           Some of the best books, and music now days have bad stuff in then like drugs, language, sex, gangs and much more but sometimes books like that can teach you a lesson on how to avoid that going down the road. So if you take those books off the shelves and werent able to listen to that music maybe your child could do some of those things. They really wouldnt know the side effects and bad thing that could come out of those things. Some of the top music and books have offensive materials in then and why would you not let your kid read them because of a couple choice word in them.I know some of this material could be bad for people but sometimes it can teach you a huge lesson in your life.     If there are book you dont want youself to read then don't read them. I think it would be unfair to take everthing that have some bad language or maybe some racism away from us just because you don't think its good for your child to read. Its not fair to people who @MONTH1 enjoy those books to not have the luxary to read those book anymore cause a few parent got mad about a book. Some of the old books have alot of racism in them, and you actually @MONTH1 read some of them in a school for a class. Those book @MONTH1 also have bad language in them to. Take thing those books away from us @MONTH1 take away are education, and we won't be able to learn from those books like we should.          So i think that censorshipn in library is just a horrible idea. It can take away from lesson we could learn and are education that we need to be successful in life"	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
3232	2	"Do you believe that certain materials,such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect., offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experince, observations, and/or reading.           I do believe that if it's a book you not suppose to get, if it's not for age group, don't get it. Some libraries contains books that's highly not appropriate for children, they have sections for adults and children to check out books. Some libraries need book monitors to guide and put up certain types of books.The library is  a plcae with all types of books, so you should go to your own section and check out your type of book.           When I first went to the library for the time I didn't know what book to check out, so the librarian should me my section by showing me my age group. By then I was checking out books that was appropriate for my age, magazines I didn't care to much about, I just wanted to read a whloe book.              In conclusion, when ever you nedd a book good or check out your section, make the book is appropriate for you and feed you mind with knowledge."	3	3		3	3	2	3																		
3239	2	"I strongly believe that books with offensive things should be pulled out the library. It not okay for you too say one thing and something your child found in the library say it okay. what if you were talking to your kids about not smoke and how it bad for them and could potentially kill them, would you like you child to say that i can smoke because all this character in the book are smoking? No that not right it just pure wrong. They shouldn't allow those kinds of books, music, movies, or magazine in the library.     In high school we were told by our parents that we should not smoke do drugs or anything like that. Sometimes it might be hard to believe the things your parents talked to you about and how harmful they are to you and your body and would lead you to a trouble life down the road. Movie we watch today talk about doing drugs and how cool they are and how they had fun driving a stolen car. it wrong to talk about them that way because it get teens to think it okay for them to do it and nothing bad is going to happen. The media does a bad job of showing teens it not right to do the things they see on tv. The library set a bad example by allowing those kinds of books to sit on the shelves and think it okay for people to read them and not take it offensive.      I was reading a book that was talking about how they think it okay to act rascist aganist other people and say mean thing and call them bad name. I really took that offensive because i wouldnt like someone calling me name and saying bad things about me because they think it okay to say things like that and act that way. If books say all those things and the readers actually believe them, then we might have a problem in our hands because some people would take offensive to it and cause a big issue over a small book and some readers might think its okay and cause even a big issue between people who take it offensive and people who dont take it offensive.     There are those people out there who think that it okay for those kind of books to be in the library and other people who think it wrong and offensive. My personal view is that i think it wrong to have those kind of books at the library. We tell people how it wrong to do bad things and how we hate certain things that are offensive to us, but it say that in the book that it alright for those thing to be happening or it right to use those foul language. I just think it personal wrong to say those kind of things in movies. music, books,or magazines are okay to be in the library yet alone in the people it self."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3243	2	"Have you ever walked into the library hoping to find a good book, and picked up a very volgar and inapropriate article? Were you dissapointed to see what children could easily get a hold of, or did you just place it back onto the shelf just simple thinking it wasn't your style of book? In this essay I would like to discuss both views on these censored books, and why I believe they should be censored.      People all over the world are vastly different. From color, race, size, shape, and personality there is not a single person on the planet who is excatly like the other, so why would they all have the same interest in reading or music? Some @MONTH1 enjoy a romantic novel that makes your heart skip beats while @CAPS1 my prefer the thrill of a horror story. Either way everyone has their own opinion of what makes a great book. The same thing accures in the question, whether or not censored items should be allowed into a public library.      Many @MONTH1 say yes, people have their right to choose what they @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not observe or listen to, 'If you don't like the style in which the item is protrayed then don't pick it up.' @CAPS1 @MONTH1 say no, 'The library is suppose to be a safe haven where they don't have to worry about children seeing and hearing things they shouldn't.' In my personal opinion I believe the parent figure is right, although I also can understand the opposing opinion.      As to the opposing opinion, I can understand why you @MONTH1 think that censored items are ok in libraries. If it is a personal choice of how the author writes the book and still makes a great story, I believe that the book is alright as long as it is not in reach of a child. Many people have different ideas on what censored means and there could be the consequence of loosing many books but there are always consequence to every choice, good or bad.      In my personal experince, I have taken my ten year old sister to the library to barrow a movie and a few books. She is very scholary and comprehinds things quickly. Futhermore when she found a book that she thought @MONTH1 be interesting. The book turned out to be full of curse words and profanity. Think about it, what would you say to your child who just learned a few curse words from a place you expected to be a safe enviroment? To me it is rediculous to have to search every single book, cd, movie or magazine for profanity to make sure it is safe for my sister to read! Kids these days have changed majorly in their attitudes, language, and responses to things and I believe a big part of why is because of what they take in through the worldly materials. If the books and the music they read and listen to are offensive and rude then what else would they know other than to follow the lines of something more 'cool' than them. Therefore I believe that there should not be censored books in a library, and parents should have the right to ask for them to be removed.      When I sit back and realize what I would want my kids to be reading and listening to I wonder why people would even chance the fact that their child could be negativly influenced by it. Why tempt them to be someone that reflects profanity and offensiveness when they could be so much more? Parents should do everything they can to make their kids the best person they can be and I believe that they have a right to protect their children from not reaching their full potential. Therefore in the end books should be censored!"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3249	2	"There is a type of boundary that @MONTH1 restrict readers from gathering knowledge about certain things in books.  This is called censorship.  However @CAPS3 you @MONTH1 not have known is that it is thought about in every school and every public library.  @CAPS3 would you do if you saw your child reading a book that contained frightening descriptions that are to horrrific or to adult like for their own good?  This is the question that plauges them every year with new shipments of books.  Although yes that seems terrifying it is not right to take books off the shelf for a few reasons;  The congressional law allowing us to have freedom of press, freedom of thought, and the fact children must take in  all the knowledge they can to be the best they can achieve.       First of the arguements that can be held is the freedom of press.  This law was enacted in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 and is still in effect today.  If an individual wanted to write a book that was not for children then he or she @MONTH1 do so without penalizations.  Children @MONTH1 read it yes, but that shouldn't be blamed on the author.  If so then that person would never get any royalties for their story and no money to support themselves.  It's hard to get upset with your children for learning something wrong, but it's not right to blame the writer.      When it comes to the arugements of @CAPS3 to do on censorship the freedom of thought pops into most minds.  This is another law that says citizens are allowed to think @CAPS3 they will of anything.  Just as the freedom of press an indiviudal can pick up that book for adults and read it.  No matter the age they are.  If they are discouraged by it then by all means let them put it down, however, if they enjoy the read and the more unique wording than in childrens novels let them continue learning.       A child can absorb many things and recall them at times where adults sometimes cannot remember.  This is not scientificly proven but when you are around children constantly you notice this.  Just as a babies mind is a sponge it still continues to gather all of the information it possibly can during its pre-teen years.  When they are allowed to read any book and not sit infront of a television screen all day they learn more.  Now someone can come along and say:  '@CAPS3 if the book is a fantasy?'.  It's no different.  The storyline is not @CAPS3 teaches them, it is the words and how they are used that is knowledge.  An educated man can sometimes get tounge-tied with words where as if someone who did not do well in school or college read quite a bit they are able to use words with great ease.  It is not allways the case, but wouldn't you like your own child to sound intelligent while speaking during important events?     All in all it seems to be a great waste when censoring books for the public.  There can be great things in those books that not everybody can reap.  Pulling them off the shelf could mean that you impede someones ability to learn a new word or gramatical law.  If one parent could pull a book off a shelf then another could do it and soon you would not have any books.  It would be a scary day if that happened.  For it would not be something that went well in our history.  Since humankind has had writing we became more intelligent, taking books off all of the shelves would revert us to primitive beings.  So keep the books on the shelves even if children should not read them.  Not just because they can learn far greater with a book as a resource, but that the two congressional laws say it should be"	3	4		3	4	4	4

I personally think that if people could do that they would, but is everything someone else finds offensive really offensive to you? No, it might not be, so does that give that person the right to pull it off the shelf permanatly so no one else can read it? I think no one has the right to pull that item off the shelf because of there own opinion of it.     If anyone could do that would there ever be uniqueness in people? I dont think there would be. Just because you think the music a person listens to is offensive does not mean they think the same. Thus it shouldnt be taken away from that person if he/she enjoys listening to it.     On the other hand I understand that some people might listen to music or read books that has offensive language and that they would not want there children hearing or reading that but that does not mean the music or book should be pulled from the shelf. Ask yourself if you would react the same way to a person who uses offensive language what should we do then? You can just take that person out of the world.     So I guess the point im trying to get across is that just because you think its offensive and dont like it doesnt mean everyone in the world thinks that. To end my acticle I want you to think about whats offensive to you @MONTH1 not bee the same for others."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3254	2	"Censorship, or the removing of material deemed inappropriate or offensive, has been used as a means of controlling people's thoughts and feelings for many centuries. The @CAPS1 used it in the @CAPS2 colonies during the @CAPS2 @CAPS4 to keep the colonists loyal to the crown. The @CAPS5 used censorship not just during the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 as a brand of propaganda, but also during @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS11 under @CAPS12 guidance. Censorship is still in use in the @LOCATION1 today, as a way to 'protect the children'. The @ORGANIZATION1 tells the @CAPS2 public what we can and cannot watch on television and what we can and cannot listen to on the radio. Other organizations tell us what books we can and cannot read, what video games we can and cannot play, and what items we can and cannot buy. Such organizations, I believe, are pushing the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 and other freedom-loving nations to the edge of totalitarianism.     As Katherine Paterson stated, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' If one person has the right to control what we buy, what we listen to, and what we see, then how come we don't have that right to control the same things for them? Where do we draw the line? Eventually, all books, movies, magazines, music, and video games would be deemed offensive and inappropriate. Culture would slowly wither and die, and our lives would become drab and essentially useless, for lack of a better term.     I recently read a book titled '@CAPS14', by @PERSON2, about two periods in a boy's life: his childhood with his family in tribal @LOCATION2, and the life he had after his mother's death in the @CAPS15 capital of @LOCATION3. @PERSON2's work includes some passages that are less than angelic, and, had strict censorship been in place, these passages would have caused the book to go unpublished. @PERSON2's work gave not only myself but a multitude of others insight into the life that @CAPS16 face in the changing landscape of their @CAPS7, and it certainly made me realize once again that I have a life rich in family, friends, and comfort.     All in all, censorship is a horrid disease that slowly infects and consumes every part of our lives. If you get to censor something you find offensive, then why don't I do the same thing? Some censorship is good, and a fact of life. But we have to ask ourselves, where do we draw the line? Where's the boundary between safety and and outright police state? Censorship is just a fancy term for blatant disregard of the @CAPS17, as freedom of speech is guaranteed for all @CAPS2 citizens. As a famous colonial revolutionary once said, '@CAPS19 me liberty, or @CAPS19 me death!' If censorship continues to grow and our libraries grow emptier and emptier, then I shall take death over liberty, for liberty with censorship is no liberty at all."	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
3255	2	"If any book, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be offensive to anybody don't even bother to look at the material.  Even if you might find it interesting, in then end you find out that it is offensive to you then just take it the other direction.  No material of books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the materials because authors, directors, and music writers have made it their creation. Nobody has the same views as everybody else, each person is different in their own way.  Then why is it so bad when they have offended you if it wasn't intentional?     Each individual has their own opinion of each material. It might be offensive to somebody else, but to another person it might not even effect their views about what they've read, seen, or heard. Others @MONTH1 have to realize that even if its written down it is not directed towards the person reading it, if they have tooken it the wrong way. Even if your just making an observation just walk away and do not let it get the best of you. Don't let anybody tell you different of your own opinion.     The cenorship in libraries are not made just for you, they are made for everbody around you. If you do not like a book in the library or even think it is inapropriate then just walk away and put it down. Anything in the library shouldn't be removed, just because you didn't like it doesn't mean that somebody else will find it interesting. If you find any material offensive then maybe you should think in your head of ways to make an argument to prove the authors that they are wrong.  You just have to be strong and take anything that comes your way, and you have to be ready for it.      I go to the library once in a while,and most of the time i'm just looking around for something to read and I find something interesting and I pick it up. Once I start reading it, and if I feel  the type of material is directed towards me and I find it offensive I just leave it along and put it down.  I don't take it the wrong way because I know it isn't a serious type of matter, because it didn't have my name in the book. So, why should I get worked up about it if it isn't about me?  I don't take any type of material that I'm looking at in any negative way because I know that someone else's opinion and not my own.      If anybody takes it the wrong way then they should look at other things about the topic and put your own opinion on the topic. Anybody should know that your own opinion matters than anything else or anybody else. The littlest things shouldn't get to anybody, especially if it doesn't matter.

3265	2	"A very wise man in @CAPS1 life once said, 'The only way to escape temptation, is to remove the temptation all together.' @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERSON2, while growing up had poor influences all around him. @CAPS4 went to a run-down school, lived in a crime torn neighborhood, had a drunk for a @CAPS2, had no mother around to help him and had an older brother that often beat him and hurt him, emotionally and physically. As @CAPS4 grew up there were temptations to do the wrong thing morally all around him. @CAPS4 had no example of how to behave, yet @CAPS4 stayed away from @CAPS3, tobacco, drugs, guns, prostitutes, violence and fighting, and even something as 'minor' as pornography.      As I have been growing up with @CAPS1 @CAPS2 as a hard working individual and having @CAPS1 mother around to help me with school work and preparing for college, the truth shows how times have changed. Just before I was born, @CAPS1 parents moved out of the old crime riden neighborhood and out of the city for that matter. We moved to the suburbs where crime is more rare and mostly just misdimeaners. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 told me one day, 'I'm scared by how the times have changed. When I was a kid, fowl language was un heard of in songs and music but now-a-days the songs seem to be about nothing but sex, drugs, killing people, and even about rape! At this rate I'm scared of the thought of what you're kids are going to see, son.' @CAPS4 had a valid point. In our curent days the youth can go to even the public library and get books on illegal drugs and movies with sex scenes and music that talkes about killing law enforcement officers.      What has the world come to when a child of age eight @MONTH1 walk into a public library and check-out a book on cocaine? The worst part is that they can just read these books while browsing, they don't actually have to check the book out. A quote from the author Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I believe that rather than hoping they don't pull the book off the shelf that we should just remove the book from the shelf and @CAPS5 have the book there at all.      Public libraries are marked as safe places for children and adults to go to if they feel thretened or endangered. Well what if @CAPS1 @CAPS2 as a parent feels thretened by the fact that there are evils out in the world and they have become so accepted by todays society that they are even found in the public library? Then what? Public libraries and other public resourcess should be controled and monitored about what they allow into their doors. A parent SHOULD @CAPS5 have to hope that his or her child doesn't pick up a book about an inapropriot topic while in public but should know that that is @CAPS5 the case.

3269	2	"Typically when you walk in to a library there are books, magazines, movies, and cds everywhere. Most of the items in the library are appropriate for children, but some are for adults and teenagers. Many people struggle with the fact that there are items in the library that are offensive to religion, have offensive language in them, or contain adult materials. In this country we have a freedom of speech and a freedom of religion which allows us to choose things that we feel are correct in certain situations such as this one.     True, there are books out there that are very offensive to certain types and religions of different people. Have you ever seen or heard of a movie that was educational yet offensive? In my opinon people should have the right to censor what the library provides for their student or child, to a certain extent. If a book or magazine or whatever it @MONTH1 be is offensive to someone, I believe that they should be able to choose if their student or child gets to look at that certain item. People should not take this censorship ability out of hand.     I believe that our generation is much different from ones in the past because most of the things we have to deal with are things that are most likely offensive to a certain religion and or type of person. Which in a sense is hurting the censorship of all the people who choose to take part in it. I believe that a person or authority figure at the moment should be able to take a book off the shelf if and only if they request it to the library and they approve of it.      People have the right to do what they choose, but taking away other peoples chances to read a book, or check out a movie is going a little far with that censorship privalige. I think that when a person feels that an item in the library is offensive they should have to sign a piece of paper stating why they think it should be taken out of the library and the people you believe it is offensive towards. In doing so i believe that only that certain item should be taken away from that certain group of people.      All in all i believe that the censorship in libraries is a spectacular idea because of all the bad things in the world that come out in books, movies, and cds. People have the right to change things if they believe they are wrong. They should jump at the chance if it comes to a point where they can change things for the better! Do you believe that censorship in libraries is a good idea? I do, because it gives people to oportunity to change and make things better for themselves if they believe something is offensive."	4	4		4	4	4	4

3274	2	"In our world today, there is a way to find anything that you could ever want under one roof.  People call these buildings libraries.  Libraries hold almost every book ever writen and offer them to the public free of charge.  If you can not find what you are looking for in a book, they also have many other resources: movies, music, magazines, and the internet.  I am not here to say that we should band any materials that are offensives because everything is offensive to somebody.     There is always somebody out in the world that would say they are offened just to make a point or to get attention in our world today even if they did not even care about the subject at hand.  The internet can take you to just about any thing that you would ever want to go to.  Yes, the libraries do have blocks on the internet for websites that are very outragously offensive, but people have learned how to get around the blocks.     Libraries are set up to where all the kids materials is in one location, all the teenage stuff is in another spot, and all the adult materials are in another room.  As a young child, I liked going to  libraries and having fun and reading, but the one thing I never did was go to the adult room and I think many other other kids feel the same way.  In fact, I have never seen a child in the adult section of a library.     Movies and music have ratings and if the rating is over what the child should be watching, then the child can not check the movie or music without a parent's signiture.  This ensures that kids can not check out bad or offensive materials without parental consent.     Our libraries are set up just fine the way they are and I feel we should not try to change the libraries in any way.  Movies and music have rating and kids can not check out offensive materials.  The materials in a library are organized by age group and kids usually do not venture out of the area of their interest.  Last but not least, if we took out everything in libraries that are offensive, then we would know longer have libraries in our communities."	4	4		4	4	4	4

I think books should be removed from the shevles if found offensive.      Libraries need to up their standards of what should be in the library and what should not. The books, movies, music, ect. needs to be in a certain section of the library to where the little kids can not go or reach. A library is a family place not a fun zone for adults.

We walk into the library and the old lady at the front desk says, 'there is a huge storm coming.'

We get up to the front and i turn in the bad magazine that @CAPS2 had found. The lady askd why I was bringing it to her and i had to tell her the bad news, that it was up in the childrens section.

Something being offensive isn't always a bad thing. There's many different reason why, but removing something because of someone else's opinion isn't right.     First, whether you find something offensive or not, is laregly based on your culture. To most @CAPS1 cultures, declining food is offensive. To @CAPS2, eating or hurting cows in anyway is a complete disgrace. If something is offensive to one person, it @MONTH1 be because they have a different background. You're never going to please everyone.      Second, one of the best thing's about the @LOCATION1 is that you can have your own beliefs. If something was removed from the shelf at a library, because someone found it offensive, I would be disturbed. I have my own beliefs that I'm sure not everyone agrees with. Some of my beliefs wuold be offensive to certain people. That doesn't mean I should have to stay silent about my beliefs, does it? No, of course not. I wouldn't want anyone else's beliefs forced on me. I'm sure no one wants my beliefs forced on them. By removing things from a shlef becuase took offense at it, you'd be removing freedom of speech from the shelf also. That's not only wrong, it's illegal.     Some people would be offended at a book with a cross on it. Some people would be offended by a @CAPS3 cover with a pentgram. That doesn't mean they should be taken away. It's good to get offended sometimes. It often makes people stand up for what they believe. To me, it's reminder of why I believe what I do. I @MONTH1 be angered by what I see. I'm sure the terrorist group @ORGANIZATION1 is greatly offended when they see the @CAPS4 flag. We wouldn't stop waving it, would we? That'd be absurd! Just because someone takes offense at something doesn't make it wrong. It never has. It just means they have different beliefs. We should have the maturity to look away instead of demanding that it be removed.      I personally believe that removing things from the public eye, merely because they're offensive, would be wrong for many reasons. So many people find so many thigs offensive. It'd take away everythign if we removed eac and every one. Removing offensive items would also be an intrusion of freedom of speech. Plus, many things that are offensive often remind of of who we are. We should be string enough to look away and not fight about it. I don't think they should be removed. I want my library to be what @CAPS5 was made to be, a mixture of cultures and backgrounds. I don't think anything should be removed unless it directly causes harm to people"	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
3311	2	"Have you ever wondered how libraries pick their books? Well, I know I have. There are some material out there that no one wants a little kid to get a hold of. I believe censorship should be allowed in libraries, because the censorship of books is vital for the kids of the world to live a life without books about violence, another reason is that it not only affects the lives of the children, but the social lives of everyone, and the overrated music of our generation.     My reasons on this subject can be viewed in two different ways, but I would like to view it in my way. Look around, are their little children around. Well, if there is I would be looking at what they are reading or doing. The children might be reading books that are too explicit for their age. Take for example, a child that is six years old, and can do whatever he or she wants. They have no limits. So, one day the child decides I am going to check out a book at the library. The child obtains a book that is about violence and sex. What does the parent do when that child brings that book home? Nothing. The parents do nothing because they do not care about their own child. The time is now to step up to the plate, librarians. Take a stand and censor those books. This is what could happen to anyones child if there are books out their that could be harmful to anyone that picks them up.      Children aren't the only ones that are harmed by this deadly disease called noncensored books. Think about the conversations that go on in schools and at the work place. What are the conversations mostly about? I would take a wild guess that they are mostly about sex and violence. How do these conversations come up? Well, the only reason is uncensored books at the library. Anyone can check out a book at the library. It could be the elderly all the way down to toddlers. When I was little, my parents use to tell to go to the library and learn something. What if the library didn't have censored books, what would I be reading? Social lives are very affected by what they learn and how they learn the material.      Lastly, why is that everyone time I turn on the radio, there is always a song that is not right for anyone to listen to. I listen to the radio station @NUM1 sometimes and all the music is mostly about violence. Guess what the libraries have some of these compact discs of these artists that are played on this radio station. At the library, there is a music section, movie section, and lastly the books. All of that material combined can create a social disaster, if the material isn't censored. I believe that censored music is the best path to go, because our world wouldn't be obsessed with violence if they have never read or learned about it.      Why should we have to suffer anymore with uncensored books at the library? Take a chance and fight for what you believe in and vote for censored books. A library is a place to sit and enjoy the surroundings. It is not a place for violence, so quit with it, go for a safer environment. No one deserves to be offered the damaging violence of uncensored books, and music"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3312	2	"'@CAPS1', the woman shreaked as she had just received a fierce, sharp,and quick stab in the back by her abusive husband. This is the kind of violence children read about all around the @CAPS2. To think all of the innapropriate stuff children see around the @CAPS2 in television, the internet, and even what classmates are talking about isn't enough, well you are wrong. Some of the things you read and hear about in books are totally unacceptable. This is why books, and magazines need to be censored in libraries all around the @CAPS2.     In our community library in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 we have magazines, in which case these magazines are very graphic. Kid's will read these over any learning or interesting book. Many kid's draw disrespectful things in them. As to think that wasn't ignorant enough they also rip them in half and do many other dismantling things to them. One of the reasons why I feel that the @CAPS2 has so much trouble with criminal people is kids feel these days that they are allowed to draw in books and rip them in half even though they aren't their property. Which allowes them to think they can do whatever they want. Kids read about crazy things that aren't necessaarily teaching you anything. Unless that is you want to learn about having a zombi apocalypse and zombies take over the @CAPS2. To have that in a school public library what is that teaching kid's? Absolutely nothing, but to teach them to take them home and show there little brother or sister a cuss word in the book is teaching them bad things. These are all some valid points as to censor or take out some of the leisurely reading books in the libraries, or to possibly censor some of the cussing.     The last point I will be touching on this discussion is the loss of money that some of the schools have due to damaged books and stolen property. Also to mention all of the dirty pictures kid's draw in the magazines and books. Schools lose a great deal of money just to touch that point. They would save a much needed amount of money if they didn't let those books leave the classroom or school library. Kid's wouldn't be able to draw in them or steal them or even damage them and all the money they could save and put it towards something learn fulfilling.     Well behaved children all around the @CAPS2 is what you can look forward to if you censor books and magazines all around the @CAPS2 in libraries. If you dont let them be taken out of the library how could kids possibly damage or steal or even draw in them. By not allowing kid's do do whatever they want and showing some authority lets kid's around the @CAPS2 know they need to show some respect. With all the money libraries and schools save they can put it towards something learn fulfilling. If you could please take the information i have given you and think about it, it would be greatly appreciated"	4	3		4	4	4	4																		
3315	2	"Over time, libraries have been used as a big resource when doing reports, researching, renting movies and simply trying to find something new to read. They have been used as a gate way for an extensive world of reading and learning. All libraries should have the right to have the content they please to have on thier shelves. No book, music, movie, magazine , etc., should ever be denied a place on the shelve because of it's content.         Sex, drugs, violence. There are many books over these topics that many people @MONTH1 find offensive or just completely oblivious. Every mind is diffrent when it comes down to what it likes to read, watch or hear. No mind is the same, so no mind will ever like exactly the same thing. When ever someone wants to go buy a book about safe sex, it should not be denied to them because the library does not allow it. It should be placed on a different section of the library.           Many books that people find as explicit content to them, @MONTH1 not be to others. When i was in middle school, i heard alot about sex, and drugs. I never knew what it felt like or how did it feel. What i did know was that I could get accesible information from my local library. What happens when a child wants to know more than she does? She looks, and researches it. If i would have been denied the access to books about sex or drugs, I would have probabaly never been warned about the out comes or the seriousness of them both. When you walk into a libraby and observe. Not everyone is reading a book about rainbows, and unicorns. Many people read books about the real life, books that they can relate to. Many of those books that many people read are those that others calls explicit. The purpose of a library is to have access to books, magazines, music, and movies of all kind of content, reguardless of others concerns.            Also, Libraries can do many things so that certain contents @MONTH1 not be near others. They can organize there topics and genres. Explicit, or eighteen or older books, movies, magazines or music @MONTH1 be placed in a back room or simply on another side of the library. Far from the reach where kids and children are able to access.            In conclusion I believe with my strongly supportive ideas that books, magazines,  music or movies should not be removed if found offensive because every book has a right on the shelve no matter what. No book should be removed because someone @MONTH1 find it offensive. If a person finds something offensive they should take it up with the author or publishers not the library for they only let people borrow the conten"	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
3317	2	"Have you ever got or check out a book or something that has been racial to you or you think it should have been censored? I haven't but I checked out a book before that had a lot of racism in it and sex. Im not racist but some people are very racist. Some of the book in libraries aren't sutible for some viewers but yet again the can check it out, some books, movies, magazings, and others should be taking in consideration on being removed so some viewers can't read them.     In libraries there are book that have alot of racism in them. Some racism gets to be very bad in the book and it could intrest and provoke the young viewer to go down that road in a later life. Which could be very bad if you think about it. He could talk his friends into becoming what he is. talk them into becoming racist towards others. No mother or father wants their kids to be racist, but there are familys that are racist. Which i don't get because we are all the same to me.      In some books in the library there is sex talk that accores in it. Sometimes the sex talk gets into great detail which isn't sutible for young viewers, because they could get the idea that they want to try that with someone of a different genger. Which is okay if ur older but if ur really young and reading a book with sex talk in it. Well that's wrong because young kids shouldn't be introduced to that kind of life stile till later in life. Some parents wouldn't like their kids to read that kind of book. I know I won't let me kid read a book like that.      Music is something that everyone listens to, no matter is its rap, country, or the blues. Certain people like certain kind of music. Some people think that rap music is offensive and should be removed off the shelves. Well rap music is based on their past and how their life is. It does have some racism in it like certian rappers say bad words that aren't really sutible for young viewers.      Although some of the racism and cencorship that should be cencored are on shelves, I think it should be in a separete room so only older people can check it out or buy it, instead of the young kids getting a hold of it. I believe that books should have racism in it because it shows how much we have changed from the past"	3	3		3	2	3	2																		
3320	2	"There is a certain amount of responsibility when it comes to censoring all the different types of media and literature. Deciding whose responsibility that is can be a difficult task. Children can be strongly influenced by all media out there and making that material has been made easily accessible. When someone comes of age to make decisions that affect their life then they should be able to. Shop owners should be able to sell whatever they want in order to make a living.     When children go to a library usually they will not do so alone. Parents can decide what their child is allowed to take home or not. When a child comes to their parent with a book, movie, or magazine that is offensive or inappropriate it comes to the parent to decide whether or not they want their child to be exposed to that material. If the parent allowed for their child to have access to offensive media then that can give the child the idea that what they are looking at or reading is alright.      If someone has come of age and has all the other freedoms that everyone else has they should be allowed to buy, read, and watch what they want. To prove to someone that you are of age to have access to offensive material you should have to show some sort of identification proving it.      A shop owner or businessman/woman should be able to sell whatever he or she wants to in order to make a living as long as it stays within the boundaries of the law. Having someone who does not work in the law or a person who is not a legal guardian or parent of someone who is not of age should not tell someone not to buy, read, or watch something just because it might be offensive or offend that one person.     I conclude that in order for a someone to tell another person not to buy or rent material that person would either have to be law enforcement or their legal guardian as long as they are not of age. There is no reason why people should not be able to access material that is not against the law. If someone is offended by some literature then they should try to make it against the law."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3321	2	"Censorship, thats a word that causes alot of arguements in today's society. People have extremely different views on censorship throughout the world. In some countries dictators do @CAPS4 allow their citizens to have internet access watch the news or in some more extreme cases @CAPS4 even watch television at all. The majority of the time they do this because they do @CAPS4 want the citiznes of their country to know what is happening around the world. This sets up a 'fish bowl' environment meaning that people from other countries see all of the issues in that country but the people actually in the country have no idea whats going on around them.     Although we don't always see censorship in that extreme of a sense it is still plays a large part in today's society. Everything from music on the radio to military files are censored. Think about it, how often can you listen to a song on the radio that all of the original words are still intact? Arguements over censorships have gone back and forth for years without really making much prgress at all. Each side of the arguement whether its for or against censorship is almost entirely opinionative. No one can say for sure that censorship is completely needed or @CAPS4. It's just to hard to determine who's opinion is really, more convincing.     In my opinion I dont think anything should be consored, if the writer of a @CAPS1 show throws in a vulger word most likely it's for the effect that it has on people to show emotion. The samething goes for songs, when an artist writes the lyrics to a song they are trying to convey a message and they use certain words that get their point across more effectively or more dramatically. Parents argue that their children are seeing to much violence on @CAPS1 and are causing behavior problems along with other things, and that shows need to be more suiting for children. There is an alternative to censoring all of these things, rather than 'ruining' everyone's fun just dont let your kids watch that show.      In the @LOCATION1 today we have something called freedom, we exercise this right everyday with what we wear, and what we say. I think that we should take that freedom and apply it to censorship. Instead of complaining about violence in movies and sex on @CAPS1 you can make a decision simply to @CAPS4 watch that kind of show. Everyone has the option to say NO; if you dont want to hear or see something simply choose something else to watch, or even just do someting entirely different. You DO @CAPS4 have to do anything that you don't want to do. It's is an easy solution, all you have to do is exercise a right that you have had since the day you were born an just say no, I dont want to do that. It's very simple and could potentially stop all debates on whether or @CAPS4 things need to be consored."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3322	2	"Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON1,           Should certain books be removed because some people @MONTH1 think they are inappropriate for their children to see or read? No, I do not think they should be removed. I honestly think all they all should be put in different sections of the library by age.      Like all the children books and magizenes should be in one section. The younge adult and or teen books and magizenes should be in a section by its self. Then the adult books and magizenes should be in their own section. Even the autobiographys and documentories should be in their own section too.      It would make things easier to find the book you are wanting to read. For example, if your a teenage girl looking for a book about a high school girl with a crush on a boy, it'd most likely be in the section for the younge adults.      So yes, the parents that are concerned about their children's viewing of certain books should be able to say something about it. But what if one teenager is looking for a book about a famous person's autobiography for a school project. Even though it includes how they used to be into drugs as a teenager. That person shouldn't have to fail if they can't find it in a library because some concerned parent didn't think it was appropriate.     Like I said the best thing to do is put all the books in subcatagories by age. It would make things was easier and faster to find the book of your selection"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3324	2	"Libraries should have censorship because young kids could come and open and look at it. I think we should have it because it would make sure the kids wont look at them. There are three reasons why they should have censorship. First they can teach kids bad things, second bad influence, and third they just dont need to be there.     First was they can teach kids bad thing. That is because they would start looking at it more. Then they would get in trouble. There is really no reason for them to looking at it at all.     Second, its a bad influence. They go and tell and show there friends and make them start doing stuff that isn't right. Makeing then do stuff and then have a bad future.     Third there really isn't no reason they should be looking at it. Like unless it fell from a book case and was laying on the floor. But there really isn't no reason they should be looking at it.     I think we should have it so it cant hurt and kids so everyone would be right in life"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3330	2	"Eventually, everyone sees or hears offensive things. However, the government has taken it upon themselves to try and keep youth from seeing it. They believe the parents should tell their children about everything while they try to make it one big secret for kids. But, if kids are introduced early, we would not have to keep it a secret anymore. Libraries and all types of media should not be censored.      Kids always ask questions like 'where do babies come from?' and adults, wanting to avoid an awkward conversation, make up stories or do not tell them the whole truth. Imagine a world where the government let the media say whatever they want. Yes, at first it would be vulgar but the government would then have the right to teach about sex and drugs in school. More kids would be educated, so less of them would be curious enough to do any of that stuff.     That is not to say that newscasters should curse everytime they are on television. It is merely suggesting that instead of having a metaphorical black curtain over half the news, they report the whole truth. They have freedom of speech, and we have a right to know.     At first, people would think it was a terrible world. But, eventually, with right leadership, it would help make a more truthful environment. Kids would learn about sex and drugs in school, and have a safe environment to answer their questions if they have any. Drug use and rape would go down. Then, talking about 'offensive' topics would be non-existent so kids would not be embarassed if they had questions. This would change the world for the better."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3334	2	"Have you ever been in a library and thought to yourself, 'hey, this book looks pretty good.' But once you read @CAPS3, you deamed @CAPS3 as innoproprate for younger people? I have, but unlike some people, I don't blame @CAPS3 on the libraries. I blame myself for picking @CAPS3 up in the first place. Some people do not want to take the responsibility for their actions, and so they blame @CAPS3 on the library for carrying a certain author's books, a band's songs, or a magazine's articles.     This brings me to say that books, music, magazines, newspapers, etc. should not be taken off of the shelves of libraries. Just because some people do not like the content that they hold, doesn't mean that @CAPS3 can't be helpful or entertaining to others. I think @CAPS3 should be a matter of choice, like choosing which outfit you want to wear in the @TIME1. There are  too many options, like when @CAPS3 comes to the books, movies, music, and magazines. If something strikes you as innoproprate, then simply take @CAPS3 back and exchange @CAPS3 for something better.     One experience I can think of that is a good example of this is when I was @NUM1 years old. My mother took me into the library and I found a book, 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3.' I showed @CAPS3 to her just like any other time we had gone to the library. Only this time, she did not want me to check @CAPS3 out. She saw @CAPS3 as too harsh of a book for me to read at the time, she wanted me to wait untill I was older. @CAPS3 was about @CAPS1 abuse and she saw @CAPS3 as a very innoproprate book for my age, at the time. But she didn't blame @CAPS3 on the libraries, asking why they would carry such books where children could reach them.     Other mothers and fathers are the same way, as I found out. My best friend's parents had been the same way with her. Only instead of a book, @CAPS3 was a music cd that she had wanted to listen to. They thought that she should not listen to @CAPS3 because the lyrics in the songs were too 'sad' for her to hear. They agreed that if she were just a little older then she could of borrowed @CAPS3. They did not blame the library. If someone else wanted to listen to @CAPS3, or have their childen listen to @CAPS3, then @CAPS3 was their own personal choice.      I do not belive that libraries should have censorships. They can have different sections, such as adult, children, and young adult. But I believe that they should not have to take books, music, magazines, etc. off the shelves just because of certain people. @CAPS3 should be a person's personal choice. If they do not like the item that they picked up, they should take responsibility for their actions, and not blame others for their mistakes."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3336	2	Their are some books that should not be removed from libraries do to censorship. From past exsperian with censorship I found out it can towne down a book. In the book @CAPS1 @NUM1 for exsample the books are being burnt and it is causing socity to fall apart. Censorship is from people with a more ethnich back ground that dont want the kids to grow up and see unappopreat langue.      The most recent book that I have heard of geting censored is @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The main word they are removing from this book is nigar because some people fined this word very ofinceve to their race. The comittys are trying to remove the books from school shelfs.     I think we should not have censorship just because parents do not want their kids to hear the words in school or read them when eventualy the kids will learn the words on their own or hear the words some were eles. The kids can even learn the word from their own parrent or from t.v. I personaly think that comittys should stop trying to censor every thing because they wont be able to sencer how adults talk when they are around chindren and younger adults	3	2		3	2	2	2																		
3338	2	"First off, I do like censorship laws to an extent.  However, the government cannot ban everything that they deem innapropriate.  I think it depends more on what the family deems innapropiate.     I do not think they should have any completely inaccessible areas in libraries for children of younger ages.  I believe that the viewer should have a family member's consent to view said content.  I also believe that if the content is not relative to the viewers interests, then they should just not look at it.  They are not required to look at it so if they do not like it, then they do not look at it.     However, if the library does not consent to holding the books, music, movies, magaines, etc., then they do not have to and the viewer can go somewhere else.  And if they do have the books, music, etc., then they can put limits and ratings on them.  But I do not think that an adult could go in and complain about innapropriate material.  As I said before, if they do not like it, then they are not required to look at it.     I actually think that the government should not tolerate parents whining and complaining about the content of different materials.  One parent should not have the ability to take away others' privilages to books, because they deem it innapropriate.  Just because they do not like the content, does not exclude all others from enjoying it.     Also, if a library does have an age restriction on certain materials, then appropriate acts of discipline should be taken for the viewer of said materials.  However, if the viewer has an adult family member with them and has their consent, then I think they should be able to view the material, regardless of ratings."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3340	2	"There are many books, movies, and music in the libraries. These things can come in so many varities. Have you ever been to a library and not found something you liked? Well most people find a  lot of things that intrest them in many ways. Many people come to a library a day to check out something they will enjoy and have a good time listing, reading, or watching. So many people are diferent and each person likes something diferent from one another. So the question is, 'Should we remove some books, music, and movies off the shelfs because they're offensive?'     From experince, yes there are things at a library that children or younger teenagers should not read, hear, or see. Though that most libraries split a lot of there sections up by ages. Depending on your age you should go to the sections that mostly provides the thing you want. Do not go to a place that provides something that is not your age group, instead go to the place that looks like you belong.  I personally have seen younger teens or children get a book or magaizine that was not there age group, but @CAPS1 that children wanted to look up on that thing. You have to understand that most younger teens and children are curious about many things before they even get to that age.     As a  parent or legal gardian, most children look up to you. @CAPS1 you read, listin, or watch something that is not to there age level, but the child wants to be just like you. Children look up to there parents or legal gardian. They want to @CAPS1 do the same thing you do, so they copy you. They will find soemthing that is similar to what you doing. They might go find a book, movie, or cd that is not there age group. They will do this all because @CAPS1 they want to be just like there parents or gardian. So as a parent or gardian you have to watch what you do also and try to set good examples to you children so they do not find offensive books or ect..           There are so many reason why people might think some things are offensive. Even though we are the reason why books and other things are brought into libraries today. Children today are growing up a lot faster then we want them to, but sometimes we can not stop that. Just set good examples to children or any person not to get a book, movie, or music that is not there age group. Libraries can be a fun and learning enviroment for everyone. Just sometimes we all do not think a like or like the same stuff.     There are just to many people in this world and I have read articles about libraries. I have read why libraries might not be a family place anymore all because of the varities they carry. Have you ever thought though, '@CAPS1 its use humans that makes the libraries carry these varities?' I think so, because we are what makes up a library. We the people are the ones that want these books, movies, magazines, and music. So think about it next time you walk into a library and you see something that you @CAPS1 not think is right. Think about how @CAPS1 someone @CAPS1 really likes that. We all need to except things if we like it or not at times. Just set good examples to help people not get those things that could be offensive"	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
3342	2	"Libraries provide us with knowledge, entertainment, and peace. You can go there to learn and to do research if you have to write a paper. You can rent movies, music, and books at your pleasure as long as you take care of them. Also, if you're just having a hectic day and need some peace and quiet, libraries become a perfect get away. But, heres the truth. Many people find certain things in libraries to be offensive and would rather them not be on the shevles. So, do we remove these things or let them stay?     My opinion is to let them stay. I believe that books are too important to throw out just because they @MONTH1 contain a few vulgar words or images. It's the same with magazines and movies. Also, music is changing as the years go on and many people, especially elders, don't enjoy listening to this new style of music. Just because one person my find something offensive, doesn't mean everyone else will.     People have many different views when it comes to these things. Take history for example. Many history books contain harsh, real life facts about things that went on in the past. A song, book, or movie about slavery can cause some people to be offended. Whether it's because the person opposes slavery greatly or they believe that slavery was a good thing, people have different feelings towards it. Another good example is movies. Some people @MONTH1 find a movie offensive because of words said or if a certain person dies first, while others could care less.      Additionally, many things that are found offensive to one person can make something more interesting to someone else. There are many movies nowdays that can be seen as very offensive. But honestly, the offensive things happening @MONTH1 just make someone else want to know more about what's going on. It is practically the same with books. I myself have read plenty of things that would make some people cry or even get really mad or disgusted. Even though in the end, I lfind them to be exceptionally books. It just on how you view it.     So, should things that are found offensive to one person be removed from a library? The answer is no. There are just too many things that can be taken offensively. If you start taking away these things, libraries are only going to become vacant. Younger people will stop coming because materials will be less interesting. You will lose artifacts and stories about the history of the world. There will also only be so many books to read, if ever a non-offensive book could even be found. My advise to libraries, keep materials that can be found extremely offensive in their own area, away from younger people who @MONTH1 react strongly. Maybe even put a sticker on the book, if possible, letting people know just what they're dealing with"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3343	2	"Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I adhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I believe that the books and other items should stay in the shelves of the library that censorship in libriaries is unnecessary. As Katherine Paterson stated there will be no books left on the shelves if you take every book off that someone in the @CAPS1  finds offensive. What is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be considered offensive in another persons point of view. Children, teens, and adults have their own right to choose whatever book they want to read, movie they want to watch , or music they want to listen to. If it is a child or a young teen then I believe that the parents should have a say in what their children read or watch. In my case I am not allowed to listen to offensive music or watch rated @CAPS2 movies but that shouldn't mean that it should be taken off the shelves of the library. Just because that is what my family believes to be right does not mean it is the only wat to live.     A person has their own rights to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to. They can make the choice by the way they have been raised or just because that is what they think is right or wrong. If they think that a book is offensive then they don't have to read it, they have the right to say no and put the book back on the self. If they think that the book is approriate then they can read it and there is no law stating that they have to share the book with anyone else. If there is a book out there that is offensive in your view and you read it there is no reason you have to agree with it. Every person is free to disagree with anything they want to disagree with.      If you are a parent to a child and you are uncomfortable with them reading, listening, or watching something that is offensive you should set the rules early in life with them. Parents should make sure that their children are not reading inappropriate things or listening to offensive music or watching @NUM1 or rated @CAPS2 movies. Therefore, if you are comfortable with your children seeing and hearing offensive things then you don't have to worry about what is out there in the @CAPS1.The things that your children are watching, reading, listening to isn't a problem and if it becomes a problem in the parents eyes then they have the right to stop the children from reading the offensive books or watching the bad movies and listening to the music that the view as offensive. Every parent and family is different, as long as your child knows the rules and what you believe in then there is no need for censorship in libraries.      In my family I am not allowed to listen to offensive music. Offensive music in my house is considered music with curse words in the lyrics. The words that my family considers offensive @MONTH1 be different then what other families consider offensive. I know that I don't want to and can't listen to those certain songs but that does not mean that I can't be friends or be around people that listen to that kind of music. Just because that is what my family believes in does not mean that it should be taken of the shelves of the library or any other place. What my family believes in @MONTH1 not be the right thing in another familys view. Every person has their own right and if they want to listen to that music then they should be able to. My family also believes that at my age right now I should not watch rated @CAPS2 movies. If you took all the rated @CAPS2 movies off the shelves, then half the movies would be gone and that is not fair to the people who enjoy rated @CAPS2 movies. What my family believes @MONTH1 not be what other families believe in. I know what I stand for and I will do what I think is right and I won't listen to offenesive music or watch rated @CAPS2 movies. In no way though does that mean that other children, teens, adults shouldn't enjoy that kind of music and those movies.     In conclusion, I believe that censorship should not be used in libraries. It is every persons own right and they are capable on making decisions that they think are the right thing to do. Parents also have a say in what they want their children to watch, read, or listen to. They can montor what their children are reading, watching, or listening to and if they find it offensive they can stop their children. It is not necessary to take the items off the shelf. In my family, my parents find some types of music and movies offensive and I know when I go to the library or any other place that I won't get those items. I will get the music and movies I enjoy and find age appropriate. Just as in @PERSON2's quote everyone has the same rights and if we all take the items we think are offensive off the shelves, then there will be nothing left on the shelves. Everyone has a different point of view and no one person has the correct or wrong point of view that the @CAPS1 has to follow"	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
3349	2	"There are tons of books in the library that people @MONTH1 find offensive to young readers today. I think that these materials should not be removed from the shelves. People have a right to read what they choose to read. There are many reasons why I think these materials shouldn't be removed from the library.     First of all, there are so many books that could be found as 'offensive.' @CAPS1 removing all of these offending books, you would basically be removing half the books in the library. Most young adult books have something to do with teens, drugs, violence, and other things that would come off as offensive. These books are usually the ones that teenagers read. Just because they're reading them doesn't mean their actions will be affected. These types of books are read for the purpose of entertainment and not meant to harm or offend anybody.     Secondly, I think that people have a right to choose what they want to read, listen to, and watch. Books, music, movies, and magazines are sold for this purpose. Everyone has a different opinion and taste to what they like or dislike.      Finally, I think that censoring what is put on the shelves would be a mistake. There are tons of great books or movies that could be found offensive and to take them off the shelf would make them less known. Children wouldn't know about them, and they could be missing out on some great stories.     Everyone has an opinion, and watching out for your children is understandable. Censoring what is available at the library would make finding books harder for other people. Libraries are meant to have different types of material because everyone has a different taste."	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
3351	2	"When it comes to censorship I believe that very few things should be removed. Just because it is found offensive by some does not mean it is offensive to all. A material should only be removed if and only if that material offends an over ruling majority of people. If you find it offensive just ignore it you don't have to buy it. Maybe somebody else finds it interesting and it comtains the information that they have been seeking.     When it comes to books, music, movies or magazines I believe almost anything should be allowed except for material that depicts nudity or drugs and alcohol. Other than that a little cursing here and there and some violence is perfectly acceptable, but it should probably be kept from small children if it's to bad. Usually if a child is exposed to that type of material they usually grow up believing that whatever they saw as a child is completly acceptable. Sometimes it's violence sometimes it's other things like drugs or alcohol, whatever the case @MONTH1 be.      Many parents believe that certain material should be banned because it exposes their child to bad morals. But my belief is that if your a good parent then shouldn't have to worry about that type of stuff. If you really do not want your child to be of any part of it then take actions to do such. For example if you don't want your child watching a certain television show then block it. Don't just think they won't watch it and then when they do you get mad at the people who created the show. It's not their fault maybe you as a parent should have made sure in the first place that your child did not see that material.     There are some people out there that believe that if any material depicts anything bad then it should be removed. But what I believe is that this is @LOCATION1 and people can read and write whatever they want, and if you have something to say about it then that's fine by me you can believe whatever you would like to believe. People should be able to keep their freedom of speech and be creative without being ridiculed by people"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3355	2	"I don't believe any of those materials are offensive if found in a library. But if the childrens look somewhere else to find those things then they will find them anytime. The offensive materials are out there to be pick up by some people including children.     The books aren't offensive only if found in the adult area. If so found there the children would'nt read it because it's too long for them and the book doesn't have any pictures in the book. Music is offensive but like I said only found in the adult area. Kids aren' interesting in music at that ageso they would'nt bother to see them. Movies and Magazines have offensive things in it and can be found any where, but found in a library is gonna be rare. The only thing you will find in a library that is offensive is gonna be a magazine.they make a bunch of different type of them, and can be found anywhere.     To explain the offensive, and the none offensive books that are out there. I'm gonna talk about '@CAPS1 @CAPS2.' @CAPS3 book has a lot of bad words, sexual scenes, drugs, gang violence, racism. @CAPS3 book is so offensive that the childrens parents would'nt let them read it, but @CAPS3 book is based on a true story. Everything that happened in that book was real, and people need to know what happened and why were the people in that story doing those things. Some books @MONTH1 be offensive but you can learn from others mistake by reading that book.     Everything @MONTH1 be offensive to you in one way, but looking from the other point of view it's a learning experience. People that made those mistake could tell the childrens that those stuff aren't wroth it. Everything has it's purpose. The books can tell you the story of peoples life, and the movies are based from the story and instead you can watch it. Music can tell you the life of people by poetry. Magazines really dont have a point their just there to gossip"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3356	2	"Is the censorship in libraries really necessary? In my opinion it is but only to a certain extent. I believe that most people who frenquently go to the library know what types of books, movies, magazines, etc. that are for more of the adult group and more of the teenage/children group. I think the censoring is helping to keep our youth from taking the words and actions and using them in there daily lives. If we @CAPS9't want them to read or to even hear them I think the censorship is a great thing in ways.     I believe if the censorship was to go away in some forms, I would use a different method of a censorship that was a bit more on the more favored sides for adults. The censorship would still be at the library in a certain form. There would be something just a bit different or new about whatever that person is checking out.      If we could, when people are checking out these books, movie, magazines, etc. we could use a rating just like movies do. When a child whom is @NUM1 comes to the library to check out an item and they find one they are interested in they could bring it to the librarian and the librarian would check the rating and the age of the child with there library card and see if that item is appropriate for that child. There could be many ratings @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @NUM2, and @CAPS3. I think ages @NUM3 are for the @CAPS1-@CAPS2, the ages @NUM4 are for the @NUM2 and ages @NUM6 and up for rated @CAPS3.      I see many times when children are learning words, phrases, and actions from movies, books, etc. that make them think it is ok to do or say these things. I think not. In my opinion I think that this idea could help out our youth and there parents make better choices in the content they are submitting themselves to. So if you feel like this is a good idea contact your local library and tell them you are in favor of the @CAPS7,  '@CAPS7 @CAPS8.' @CAPS9't wait until you have forgotten, call now."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3357	2	"Books, movies, music, and even @CAPS1 are all important in this life, and enviorment of ours. They all have a learning process. When you read you learn, when you watch a movie you learn, even when you listen to music you can learn. Weather its about past present or future, everyone has the right to learn it's part of being a citizen.     Speaking of all this I belive just beacuse one book, or one movie makes someone uncomfortable i dont think that you should take that away. Thats not only taking away from your kid, or yourself thats taking away from everyone else. Just like the book huckleberry fin it's a wonderful book i love it because it's about the old days where they still belived in slavery, and there were still some good-hearted people around.     This book to some would be very offensive beacuse of the fact it has the word nigger in it one-hundered and twenty-seven times. In fact last year at my school a mother tried to get it taken out, because she didnt want her son to read it he was actually a mixed boy but thankfully the committee saved it and it's still here. That's our history and everyone needs to learn some of it, weather it's offensive or not.     As well as movies that can and mostly likely is offensive to people, they still should not have that stuff taken off either, like I said earlier thats taking away from everyone else. If you dont wanna see it then dont buy it, or if something that you find innapropriate comes on just change the channel. History is important and I dont think people should keep you from your right as a citizen and deprive you from learning what you wanna learn or need to learn for the future.      Now the music part i can understand, some @MONTH1 be a little innapropiate for younger listeners so like i said before again change the station or dont buy that @CAPS2. Dont deprive people of what they wanna learn, watch or listen to.     People that feel offended or embrassed should be ashamed of them self because that is very selfish, and rude. No one should be ashamed of who they are or any movie that describes the old days in the way it actually happened, if they put it in the nice way then it would all just be a lie. That's why I dont belive in censorship. It should not happen, any book, movie, magazine, @CAPS2 should be available to who wants it"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3359	2	"I think that if u feel like they are sayin bad thing that you should not read the books or magazines and dont lisen to the music and dont look at the moves.          If you feel offensive about it just dont look at it because a porson might not find it offensive.It is port of life to look at something offensive so why do it now. I think that if they do that they might just take some @CAPS1.Vs shows off the air becuas there are a lot off shows out there that are offensive and some do not like that but they dont take it off the air so why take books music, movies, and magazines off the shelves.    i dont believe that they should do that at all becuas if i dont like it i dont look at it so i dont get mad at something somebody say bout my believe.    A porson might not like the same music u like i might not like the same music he or she likes but i dont wont to take it off the shelves they should just stop lookin and lisning to all this stuff a porson says about there believe."	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
3372	2	"Yes, I think they should be removed from the shevles. Some books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are overated and young children go to visit the library. They should have a shelve for kids, tennagers and grown-ups. Everybody should have they own section for their age group.          Young kids are already doing things that they shouldn't be doing, like hanging out in the street, hang with older kids. They watch inappropriate movies, when they should be watching something educational. The music they have out now days, children shouldn't listen to it. It's to much cursing and violent. More parents need to spend more time with their kids and talk to them about these things.          There are certain things tennagers should watch and read too. I don't think they should read about killing or sex. I rather their parents talk to them about that and stop hiding things from them. Parents will eventually find out what you doing behind close doors, they been through everything you doing or trying to do now. So just talk to them and be real about things.          I think they should be certain magazines in the library. Young children beat theyselves up, because they don't look like the young actors and actress in the magazines. They try to rush their life and be somebody they not meant to be. Young ladies want to have big boobs and butt. Then, young men want to have big mucles and be buff.          In conclusion, I don't think books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves. There should be a shelve for young kids, tennages and adults. The music that is played on the radio now days, shouldn't be on there. Magazines shouldn't out on shelves for children to reach. There are certain things tennagers should watch and read."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3375	2	"I think libraries shouldn't removed material from the shelves even thoug its offensive. The libraries should't removed offensive material because even though it might be offensive to some people other people still might want to learn about that topic. For an example the @CAPS1 didn't like the @CAPS2. In some books its has some offensive stuff about @CAPS2 that were stated by @CAPS4. Some @CAPS2 might take that offensive but other people from diffrent race or relegion might want to learn about what was said. Just because people read about it doesne't mean all of them are going to agree with it. People might have their own point of view, no one has there right of telling one person what they can or can't like.      If cenorship starts to occur in libraries or other in other communtiy places, I think people are going to get mad and might have a bigger problem than some people being offensded of their material. They might think that they are being told of what they can or can't read,listen,or believe in.That will occur a bigger conflict and get a lot of people furious. I think it will be simplier if library haves the materials on shelves and people who are getting offended of what they have in there should ignore it because why will they read or listen to something if it only gets them furious? They might be offended of what one person says but who cares, not everyone is going to think or agree of what is being said. Its just a person point of view let them be them and just stick with what you think of yourselves  and in your believes. Not everyone is right and perfect just be youselves"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3380	2	"No, I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the shelves in libraries if they are found offensive. You have the right to either read what you see or keep moving and read what you want to. Certain books, movies, magazines, etc. shouldn't be removed just because someone else doesn't like it.     If someone of a certain belief sees something offensive to them or their religion, then they have an option to not read or look at it. Something that someone might find offensive might be interesting to someone else or they might have to do an report or project on it. There's no need to discrimanate against a book or movie just because a certain religion group or someone as an individual doesn't approve of it.     It's an public library that has materials on display for the public! Any and everybody can come and read any and everything they please. A library is open to the public which means people of differenrent races, beliefs, religions etc., is going to come through and it's a possibilty that they're going to see something offensive or that they don't like. They have the option of either picking it up and reading it or the option of not paying it any attention and ignoreing it.     The choice is theirs to either let someone elses's opinion actually bother them or not let their opinion matter at all and just keep doing their own thing. People have to be strong enough to rise above all the negetivity and keep doing thier thing and keep believing in what they believe in. It doesn't matter if someone hates or have hateful things to say about you or your perticular. Don't pay them no mind at all.     I know you think censorship should be in public libraries, but that isn't fair to the people that are maybe being offended but they don't have to read it if they don't want to. They need to learn that in life there's going to be people that don't like. Even peoplr that @MONTH1 have hurtful or hateful comments to say about you. Learn to be strong enough to stand tall in what you believe in and don't let haters or other peoples opinions bring you down"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3389	2	"People should not take all the books out for the librarie. Beacuse other peolpe would probley like to look at those books also.  If people start taking books out, all the book  will be gone .So  that would mean  where would be no books form people  to look at. So thats why there should be a law that you can only have a book out for a given period of time . That would help to kept all the books in the liberary.      So if people just start talking the book for the liberary there wont be any book left in the liberary to check out. So there needs to be a law that says that you can check out a sarthen numbers of books at a time. And how long you can have the books for . If you dont bring the books back in a certain amount of time you will be charged. The amount will build up every day you dont bring ther books in. Also if you dont bay the bill you dont get to check out books until you bay the ammount. So that would be a good idea for people not to steal or take the books.     About the Book, moives, and magzines  that are the liberary.   All the books ,moives and magzines should stay on the shelves. Because if you take out one you should take out all off them. Beacuse every one needs to see  these thing in life even if it has some thing bad like a  movie  or a magzine it should stay on the shelves.     So if a book,magzine,or movie gettes taken off the shelfes all of them need to be taken off the shelf .Just becauseit not fare to there author , beacuse they toke time to make what ever they did. If you get them mad thill stop making book for me and you to read.     So thats what I think about the things you should do if you try to take books off the shelf in the liberary.But if its some thing really really bad mabey you should get it taken off the shelfs at the liberary or at any where they sell that book,moive and magzine."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3390	2	"I believe that all the uncensored books, movies, music, and magazines in a library should be taken off the shelves and put into a single room in the library and be labeled as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2.     The children that go into the library at most libraries have a space where its just kids books but when the kids go with their parents or someone that is older up to the teenager and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 they dont know what they are looking at when they just pick up a random book off of the shelf and/or rack.      Some people @MONTH1 think that it shouldn't be like that because they are weary of who might see them go into a little room marked @CAPS1 @CAPS2. However, if you don't want anyone to see you go into that room you just simply don't go in it.      So by secluding the @CAPS1 books, magazines, videos, etc. you can keep the children from just picking up any book that has uncensored pictures or grabbing a video that the parents @MONTH1 not look at and end up being an @CAPS1 film and then the kid then might want to keep seeing the stuff like that when he reaches puberty he will be eager to have sexual entercourse with a boy/girl.      Having said that, i hope that you see how my idea of sectioning off the @CAPS1 stuff will keep them out of the @CAPS1 stuff and keep them from having sexual entercourse at as early of an age as thirteen.     As far as music goes, there really isn't a way to completely keep kids from listening to music such as rap that has foul language and it sometimes talks about having sex and drugs and the kids think that the artist who wrote the song made it to be a big shot and they did drugs and had sex and look how they turned out. The best way, in my eyes, to keep kids from listening to rap is for their parents to not let them listen to it while they are with them. However, the other music like @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and @CAPS7 or even hip-hop rarely has any references to the topics of rap music.      I could also argue that parents should watch out for their kids to be aware of the consequences of some of the actions they take due to these reasons and they should take the action of diciplining the kids for their actions"	3	4		3	3	4	3																		
3407	2	"Books are important in the life of human beings wheather they are for studies,entertainment, or any other use. On the other hand, are some books offensive to readers. If certain books are offensive should you stay away from that type of book or get rid of the book altogether. With this being said, Should certain material be removed from shelves if they are offensive? Some reasons against this are you are taught to stay away from bad things, some people have different views of 'bad', and even if they are offensive they do not need to be removed.     Some materials are offensive to some people but not to others. This is the case in anything for example movies, books, and daily life. Some people @MONTH1 think the type of words used in a book make it bad, but to others that is what makes the book. For example to show the full amount of hatred for a character you have to use some offensive words. Another example is describing how horrible a person was killed, it is not enough to say he got stabbed and beat, you have to describe just how brutal it was to please some readers.       Another reason why books should not be removed is people are taught when to tell that something is offensive. If a reader discovers a book is offensive they should know to stop reading not finish the book then complain about offensive material. Also if a person rents a movie they know they aren't allowed to get an @CAPS1-rated movie then they should get another movie. People should know to not get a book read about the offensive stuff without stopping then go complain. If a person was concerned about a certain material they could ask people or go online to see if it is offensive or not.     Even if a certain material is offensive it should not be removed. That is only the opinion of sombody. If the book was needed by somebody they would not be able to get it because it was removed. If material were removed because someone said it was offensive then ther would never be any more books. For the reason that anyone can be offended, so they might just say it was worse than it actually was because they are mad.      For those reasons materials should not be removed. What if everybody started saying things were offensive ther would not be any more books. People should not have the complete say in the removal of books. Otherwise people would complain just out of spite towards certain people's material. So do you believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3432	2	"'@CAPS1 Should be Taken off the @CAPS2'     @CAPS1 should be taken off the shelves? Nothing. At least thats @CAPS1 I think. For ant book you can find some bad thing about it. People can not keep bad things away from kids it doesnt work @CAPS4 that. Wether it is cusing, sex, gore, racsisem teens will find them and I think it would be better if they were foung in a book instead of real life.     Most young adult books have cusing. There is no way around it. Teens hear cusing every day. At home, school, or even at work and yes it is offensive and no there is nothing you can do to stop it. It is there and part of our life.     Most adults think thats if they don't shelter teens then they will find all this bad stuff in music. @CAPS1 adults don't understand is that teens doo @CAPS1 ever they want to be happy. The music of today's is very offensive, but the @CAPS4 it!!!!! THat is @CAPS1 is 'hot' in the music world right now.     Ok say a kid was from a run down home and all he had was a radio, and that radio only got one station and the station was pop music, which most parents don't @CAPS4. That pop music would make the kid happy. Would you really take that away from him just because it is offensive???     Sex a lot of really good books have sex in there, but if a kid is at home reading about sex the he or she is not out doing it. Plus sex makes books better. I read books that contain rape, and other sexual acts but I've never done it only read about it.      Race is anouther big deal. 'To @CAPS5 a @CAPS6' is an amazing book and every kid should read it so they can learn. That is the whole point in reading is so you can learn. We need to learn about those kind of thing.      Keep us sheltered is not going to protect us it only makes us want @CAPS1 ever we can't have even more. Music, books, magazines, and other stuff help us learn dont take that away from us. If we don't @CAPS4 it we will not read it or leason to it. Don't chose for us let us learn on our own. It is our life. Let us make our own mistakes...."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3445	2	"I personally don't believe they should us censorship in libraries. I feel as though no one has the right to say people are or aren't allowed to enjoy certain material just because someone @MONTH1 thing that it is offensive because, thats just one persons opinion. What's one mens trash is another mens gold, what one person finds offensive could be sawt out by millions. Plus in todays world if everything was censored there would be nothing left not even church because everyone has there own opinion and there own belief. Which would eventually eliminate everything because there will always be at less one person who thinks something is offensive in someway, shape, or form. If everything was censored people wouldn't even be able to exspress themselfs.    If cenorship was used everywhere schools wouldn't be able to teach half of the material they teach today and kid would have nothing to involved. Author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I for one completely agree with this quote. It's true as I have already stated if everything was cenored there be nothing left to be enjoyed.    Think about it this way would you like someone telling you that your not allowed to read or listen to certain material just because someone felt as though it was offensive and thought it should be taken away from the public? I'm pretty sure that would make most people upset exspecially if they're a adult. I feel as though everyone has the right to choose what they read and listen to. So if you ever get asked if censorship in libraries should be allowed then think back to everything I've said before you give your answer. Once they start censoring what everyone can read and listen to then they'll feel as though they can censor any and everything and control peoples lives."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3454	2	"I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelf. They are certain books, music, movies, magazines that people find quite offensive. There could be a few books that have some aweful material in it. The pictures in magazines, on cd cases or on movie/dvd cases would have stuff that people @MONTH1 find really offensive. I have never actually seen anything like that before, but it does happen in schools all aroung the world. People might not get what certain materials want you to do, but they @MONTH1 get offended and tell someone about it. They would most likely to tell people to not get it and tell the school that they were offended by the material. Certain materials should be removed from the shelves."	2	2		2	3	3	3																		
3466	2	"What is censorship? Cenorship can be described as limitations or restrictions, and it can aslo be called common courtsy. The real question is what are we limiting?   Censorship is not something to support. Censorship to a book is like chocolate cake without the chocolate, its taking away the value and fun out of education. Though many @MONTH1 disapprove, libraries shouldn't censor their books, movies, or music because of that.      Some @MONTH1 find that '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON1' are offensive books because of their repeated use of the '@CAPS4' word. There is also some arguement to that, there are several @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that I know that find the '@CAPS4' word offensive, but not in this case. They say that it brings more educational value to the book, because in the day of @PERSON1 the '@CAPS4' word was an excepted word. Thats just how it was back then.     Back then and now censorship is hiding reality. People who write, sing, and direct things that are considerd 'inapropriate' are the ones who are trying to set the truth free. The 'inapropriate' language, or experiences are the ones that really happen and are the words that are really said. By using censorship you are sheltering the world.      Cesorship is tool we use to block ourselves from reality. Is that the right choice? Is it right sending sheltered teens out in the world unable to fend for themselves? Or should we let them understand how it really works"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3477	2	"I think that all books, music,movies,magazines, and anything thats offensive should be took off shelves because @CAPS1 are lil kids that read books and they dont need to hear or reed offensive things. But at the same time for the peope that do wanna hear or reed things like that then their should be a area in the librarie for materials like that.                    @CAPS1 are all kinds of libraries that have offensive books,movies,magazines other reasons they should take offensive materials off the shelves because it could be racist or just offening certin things and people don't wanna see or reed about white people hating black people or black people hating white people or any type of racist things. It shouldnt be alounded because it can hurt someones feelings.                  I have my own observations with reading some books from my school librarie and have came acrossed some words that was offensive. like in some books they use the word nigger and since im black it's offensive to me i know that they are not saying it to me but they still say it and it kinda touches me in a way. Im not sayin that it is offensive towards all people but it is me so the way they could is like i said instead of having offensive books out on shelves they should have one area where materials like that could be found in stead of having the material where childeren  and other people will get offened.           The last thing i wanna talk about is that for childeren and other people they dont wanna see nasty things that are in books if i had a kid i wouldnt want my childeren too c nasty things that could be offensive to. @CAPS1 books also that talk about drugs and people dont wanna hear or read about that it. but @CAPS1 are some people also that do wanna see or read about things like that like older people they have diffent point of views about things so thats why again @CAPS1 should be one area in libraries for materials like that.     In conclustion i think that @CAPS1 should hear me out and take in what i have to say because the material thats are in books,music, or magazines can be offensive to anybody any race could be offened by what they see or read so again @CAPS1 should be a place in libraries for that"	3	3		3	2	2	2																		
3478	2	"Censorship is a big part of a lot of things at the library. There are books, movies, magazines, and computers that anyone that want to get on can do so. Kids love to go to the library to get books and just hang out with friends. Strict parents might believe that books, magazines, and music are offensive and should not be at the library, But that isn't what everyone else thinks.       I believe people have different views about things. There are people that think there kids seeing bad things will make them want to do it. Others think there kids seeing those offensive things will make them learn from it. Another thing that people believe is bad in libraries is the talking. Not everyone that goes to the library wants to just sit and not talk to anyone. Most people do not go to libraries because of that.      Libraries are fun to go to. You can just about get any book there you want to read. There is no point for any parent to be worried about there child reading a book that isnt for there age group, because libraries are very good at having the sections labled for age groups. They also would not be able to check out the book because the staff there are good at making sure it isnt a book that shouldnt be read by that person. Also most younger kids that go there are always with an adult. So the parent can keep an eye on there kid if she doesnt believe its right for them to read the offensive books. Parents should not let there kid go to the library without them if they are scared for them to do something or look at something bad.      Talking at libraries is always fun because you can talk about the book your reading or just hangout. The staff and people there get so mad if kids are laughing or talking about something. I think they should make a floor people can go to, to hangout and talk.      In libraries there are a lot of good things to do rather bad things people always feel welcome there. Books that people say are offensive are usually the interesting ones. So if you do not want to see or your kids to see the offensive books and movies you should make sure not to go in the adult section."	2	3		2	3	3	3																		
3479	2	"A library is a place to go and find books, music, and other things. It's a big resource ; it has a huge variety of help for people. Question is , is everything that you can have access to be removed from shelves if there found offensive?     If books, music , or anythingelse on the shelves were found offensive they should be removed off the shelves. They should have a section for those certain kind of materials. To accsess  that certain material you would have to have a librarians permission that way it can't come off offensive to anyone. Your probably asking why you couldn't leave it on the shelf. You can't just leave it on the shelf because it could be offensive to someones cultural beliefs or seem inappropriate to the youth. So therefore thats why they would have to be removed.     I do believe they should be remooved for those various reasons. Libraries are a place to go to be used as recources or fun. Everyone who goes to a library should have everything to there needs."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3482	2	"All libraries have books for all readers no matter the age.  The books on the shelf are arranged or should be arranged in alphabetical order with the last name of the author first.  I think that some, but not all, reading materials such as books, music, mvies, should be removed due to some of the graphics in each reading material.     Every bookshelf should be arranged by age difference and spread apart from the other books and or bookshelfs.  If a child would be in the appropriate isle for there age styled books, less children would pick up the wrong book.  If children would understand to listen and follow dircections on where to find there specific age appropriate books, less accidents of children taking the wrong book from the bookshelf would occur.     If children would take the wrong age appropriate book off the bookshelf, I would think that their parent(s) would be responsible and take it back and get the right book for their child(s).  If parents would be responsible for taking action, their child should understand that they are taking the wrong book from the bookshelf.  Wouldn't children understand that if their parent has to take the wrong book back, that they would learn not to do it again?     I think that some, but not all, reading materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed due to some of the graphical features in each reading material.  The books on each bookshelf are or should be arranged in alphabetical order with the last name of the author first.  All libraries have books for all readers no matter the age."	3	2		3	3	3	3																		
3484	2	"I think that people who find them offensive just need to stay away from them type of books, music, movies and magazines. Some of the books people need to know about. Take the consentration camps for instince, people need to learn about them so we can prevent that horrible event from happining again.     I think that by letting people read those types of books it help us understand and learn what happened in the passed. So we need to keep the books on the shelf and let people learn if not we could be in danger. They can be in danger by someone being like @PERSON1 and killing millions of jews just because they look diferent. Also like slavery just because they are a different color doesnt mean they are not human. So keeping them in shelves could help our future.     Also if you are disturbed by music or movies then simply dont listen/watch them but let other people who is interested in them learn. My mom thinks that bloody-scarry movies shouldn't be allowed to sell in stores but i told her that thats what some people like watching and that people need to watch some of them to try to not let anything like them happen ever.     In conclution, we should keep some of these bad books, music, movies and magazines on the shelves so we will fight to keep horible historical events form happining again"	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
3489	2	"Do you believe everyone should have their on beliefs? Do you believe everyone should express themselves through their own culture, or have their own opinions? Where's that one place where you can experience all of those? In a library no one can judge you for your beliefs, culture, or opinions. In a library you have the right to have an open mind.     I believe that any kinds of books, music, movies, magazines, or any other material should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Everyone is different and has their own beliefs and understandings. For example, if someone were to go to the library and purchase a book about the famous and deceased @PERSON1, and the other person did not like @PERSON1 and did not understand his cultural background they would take it offensive to come across that book on the shelf. If everyone had a say on what books or other materials were put on the shelves of libraries, we wouldn't have any libraries.      If everyone kept their opinions to themselves in libraries everyone could possibly remain happy and have no arguements. Everyone could express themselves everyday, in their own way"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3492	2	"In this life time we will all have our own oppinions about topics and problems in the world. There is a question that ponders in my mind. Is censorship in libraries a problem or a right? If i was a parent, I think I would be able to understand why I mite want to have a book removed from a shelf, but the thing is though, it is unconstitutional to do that. That is why in my oppinion censorship in libraries should not be aloud.      When I was twelve, one time at the library I was reading the back of a book, and my mom approached me and told me that book was a little too graphic for me to be reading. It was about the @CAPS1. Now that I am older, I realize why my mom wouldn't want me to be reading a book like that at that age. That is one reason I can understand why some one would want to have a book removed from a shelf, but they can not do that because, that book is there to remind us why we should never have another world war again. I also think that everyone has there right of an oppinion on why somthing should be, or not should be done.     One thing that I have obserbed, is that when kids read bad things, and look at bad things, it can really have a big impact on there life as what they do in the future, and there present. That reason it's self is a very good explanation on why I think that instead of censoring books, there should be some type of boundaries posted on what types of books should be read beyond a certain age, or if the child wants to read a certain type of book, the child must have a legal gurdian with them at that time.     With that being said, I have come up with, what I believe to be a very good idea on what should be done in libraries. I think that any book that mite have somthing that is a little bit appropriate should be put into a section that is rated just like movies. If somthing has a little bit of inappropriate language such as cursing, these books should be put in a section for people over the age of thirteen just like a movie. Basically, the books will be put into sections depending on what they are rated just like a movie. If the book is rated @CAPS2, you must be over the age of seventeen to read it.     This idea could be a really good solution, that way no books would be removed, but also these books will be kept out of harms way of children. Honestly, if I was a parent I would not want my children to indulge in reading of books that talk about sex, violence, and vulger, but also it is my belief that we all have our own oppinion, and have the right to be able to read and see what we want.      On thing I think we all need to think about is things that have been done in the past that have had huge benifits on our country. Our four fathers, more than one hundred years ago wrote a document called the @CAPS3 of the @ORGANIZATION1. This document has amendments. These amendments state that we have the right to speak, have oppinions, and read what we want because, we should have the right to live a free life.               To remove books from the shelves is unconstitutional, and I don't know about you,  but I know that all the people that have gone against the constituotion have not found a great place in this world. My basic belief is that, why remove a book from a shelf, when we can impervise so everyone is happy? If the world would just get over the harsh things of the books we can all come up with a solution. There is an answer for this, books should not be burned they are master pieces. Cencorship can not continue in libraries or there won't be any books left."	4	5		4	2	3	2																		
3495	2	"I believe that certain books, movies, music, and magazines should be taken off the shelves, to those who they are offending. I myself have not come across any books, movies, or music that have offended me. I believe that we should organize our books, movies, and music in a different way perhaps.     First of all, people who are offended by certain books and movies should speak up, and do something about it. Finding a way to reach a happy medium. If everyone could take a certain movie or book off of the shelf there wouldn't be any left in my opinion. If people find it offending they should stay away from those certain types books or movies.     Secondly, there are people like me who are not offended at all from these books, music, and movies. Its not fair for the ones like me to not be able to read, listen, or watch what we want to. If someone doesn't like the movie we loved, and they take it away it's not fair and buisnesses will lose customers.     Lastly, to find a happy medium between the offended and the people like me. I believe we could organize our books, movies, music, and magazines in a different way. Instead of organizing by author they should be organized by age restrictions. Just like rated @CAPS1 movies, or rated @CAPS2 video games. Books and music can be organized in this fassion also. It would be easier for people who are offended to stay away from the ones they don't want to be around.     In conclusion, I believe that allowing any one person to take a certain book, movie, or @CAPS3 off of a shelf is not very smart. One, its not fair for people who are not offended. Two, buisnesses will lose customers. Three, there is a better way to solve this problem"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3496	2	"Dear, Newspaper editor          I have recently been faced with a situation that has made me feel rather uncomfortable at my local library, I saw a rather graphic magazine being displayed in front of the entire library. Now I know that those magazines are, for some, a point of interest, but to others they seem a tad bit crude. It also came to my attention that magazines arn't the only form of crude murchandise on the selves of our local libraries. They are also littered with movies, books, graphic posters, along with, what i find to be explicit music. I know that it would be unreasonable for me to ask for the removal of the murchandise, but I would like to display a comprimise that could come into play.      What I believe to be crude, @MONTH1 for some be acceptable, but why should I have to be uncomfortable at a public place, while the other is unphased. I believe that I have come up with a very simple comprimise, that would benefit me, as well as keep the murchandise avaiable. Now most, to all should know that there are children sections in most, if not all libraries. So I say this, what if we were to place all the explicit material in its own section, that way customers whom seek the material now know were to go to recieve it. This way, I believe would lower the uncomfortable-ness of going to our public library.      The benefits of this comprimise seem endless, to me. This way the children are left with a safe enviroment to pick out their books, and the adults that find it explicit have a comfortable surrounding to enjoy their excursion to the library. Though I am not trying to benefit those whom seek the material, I think it would. This way all of the material they want can be found in one place, and they won't have to go searching the entire library for it.     I think I speak for most when I say that our public libraries need to be a safe, family friendly enviroment, not only for children, but for those who wish to enjoy their library expierence.                          Thank you for your time,                         @CAPS1, @CAPS2 @PERSON1"	4	3		4	3	3	3																		
3497	2	"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 does that mean well I guess it means if their is a book on the shelf then they probly dont want their children to get a hold of it. Maybe there parents should look at the books first or maybe they should have taken it off the shelf. I think all books that have offensive stuff in them should be taken off the shelf.If I was going to take books off the shelf it would only be the offensive science fiction books. If @CAPS3 based on a true story and @CAPS3 offensive it should be heard anywise because @CAPS3 part of history. Everyone needs to hear it because @CAPS3 true. If I was going to take music off the shelf it would only be the ones with a lot of bad language. For movies children should only whach @CAPS2 rated movies and nothing else. For magazines children should not read magazines they should be taken off the shelfs.The experiences I had with all these things when I was a child was my parents never let me whach anything or listen with anything with bad language. But I could read any book I wanted to. It was in a book @CAPS3 not like I could onder stand @CAPS1 that bad ward ment.I think @PERSON1 saying is that she wants to keep all books on the shelf because she said 'you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  I think the point can go ether way because she says everyone has the same rights. And then she states that their wont be any books left for us. I think that means every book is bad if shes saying @CAPS1 i think shes saying.Their is a way to leave the books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,  on the shelfs. Like I sayed in the first pargraph there parents need to pay more attention to their children. And no @CAPS1 their reading. To sum it all up I say take them off the shelfs."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3500	2	"I don't think they should take down any book because they were donated to us in the first place.Also,I dont think they should take them down because it helps us learn about what other people went through in there lifetime.Look at it and try to live life as you would in another persons shoes.Try to see where they come from and there life style.Im not as big reader or anything but wants I get that one book that just catches my eye and sounds good to read I look at it and if it is good I would take it and read for a long time because I want to know what happens next in the book.So I keep reading and reading and like in the middle of the story my teacher makes me stop reading.I would read as long as it takes but it just has to be the right book for me.I like all kinds of books from sports to sad emotional books.I like reading out loud to myself it helps me understand a little bit better."	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
3511	2	"Many of us have been at the library once in our life time, but have you ever had a day when you took your little kids to the library and they grab a book or a magazine and saw something that you were not very happy with? Well many of us have. Should the library have books, magazines, or even movies that are offensive to your kids, little borther/sisters, or friends?    The public library should be for anyone and everyone to come and do what they have to do, not to see a nacket picture or something that can be offensive to you or your the little kids. Well we can do something about that. Having bad pictures in a book or magazine can be bad for the kids and even the young ones like us because many young teens can get bad censorship. The books, magazines and even movies that have offensive pictures or people with no clothes on should be removed from any public library shelves. A lot of the parents do not want there kids to go to the library and look at pictures that are really offensive. They also do not want them to be checking out movies that can give them bad influins.  In the library there should be good and fun books, magazines, and movies. The people that work at the library should remove all the bad itams. Allowing to have all the nacket pictures and movies at the library will allow some teens to get bad ideas from it. This is why the libraries should remove all this books, movies, magazines, and even music! Many of the older people @MONTH1 think that it is not fair for them. Well they should know that it can harm there kids and it can also teach there young kids bad stuff. Some of the older people @MONTH1 think different and others they @MONTH1 think the same.   Many of the parents do not want there kids to be seeing bad pictures or to check out bad movies or books. That's why removing these itams are good for many of the kids and young teens that are just learing how to have a boy/girlfriend"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3518	2	"There are many materials in libraries that are offcensive to certain people. I don't think they should be taken off the shelves but I do believe they should be put into a different section in the library.      Almost every thing in life offends someone in one way or another. It @MONTH1 be as little as 'blonde jokes' or as major as saying something about someone's sexuallity. I know little kids wouldnt understand those types of things but parents can't keep their kids hidden away forever.     If someone says something about someone else, then I do believe it's wrong. I mean think about how many 'blonde jokes' there are. A lot of blondes I know, don't take those jokes seriously. One of my good friends is a natural blonde and she is probably the smartest blonde I have ever met. Whenever she hears a blonde joke she laughs and say something funny to go with it.    Probably one of the most major things that people get offended by is politics or someones sexuallity. Politics create huge problems for people who don't think something should be one way and then if the governer turns around and says something and someone else will take it way to serious. Many people who have are different because they dont like who they are 'suppose' to like are always offended by someone in some shape or form. It's not like parents can keep us away from it forever. Little kids become teenagers, teenagers because young adults who eventually become adults. People should learn how to deal with different struggles in life.      So in conclusion, if a parent doesn't want to expose their child to things they thing is offensive then good for them but other people like to learn about the things that people find offensive and that create problems in the @LOCATION1. I believe that by leaving the books, movies and magazines on the shelves in a seperate area of the library isn't a bad idea. Think about it, if you take books away from people who want to learn about the different things and want to know why people get offended, wouldn't they feel offended too because you took that away from them"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3522	2	"People have different opinions what one @MONTH1 find extremely offensive another @MONTH1 not care or even laugh at it. In this next paragraph I will explain the reasons why censorship should not be allowed in libraries.      One of the first things is our freedom of speech. If we really have that freedom the censorship violates it completely. Some people are offensive but you must remember they are entitled to their opinion. They have a right to speak for what they belive in. Whether it be magazines, books, newspapers, movies, or music. The author or artist @MONTH1 use those to spread his/her ideas and beliefs. Another reason is people's opinions. Does one person really speak for an entire gender,country, culture, race, religion? Whether he/she is the lowest of the low or a person of great power, someone @MONTH1 believe different and miss out on something maybe they would have been inspired by or learned from. It is not right to deprive communication through these things. A man @MONTH1 find a book offensive to him or his family but another man just like him @MONTH1 find the book funny and joke about it. People think differently from each other. Personal experiences are also have a place. Maybe a near death experience causes someone to write a book. Maybe a bad break up causes someone to make a song. These help inspire people. No person can tell them it's wrong just because they thinks it's offensive or wrong.     All this things factor in. No one person or group of people have a right to take away our freedom. I am against censorship in libraries and I hope you are too."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3529	2	"There are millions of books and other media in libraries all across the world. Millions of people read and listen to those materials every day. Some people @MONTH1 like certain books or media and dislike others. Many people dislike certain materials because of their content. Everyone has the right to read and watch what they want and not everyone will read or watch the same materials. Although some materials @MONTH1 be offensive, they should not be removed from the libraries.     Books and other media should not be removed from library shelves because what some people find offensive does not offend other people. Everyone has a right to their own beliefs and opinions. If someone wants to read a book or watch a video, they should be able to. What is offensive and what is not is a personal choice and it all depends on that person's point of view. If someone thinks the content in a book, song, or movie is offensive, then they should not read or listen to it.     Materials should not be removed from libraries because they can be used to learn history and other things that people should know about. Take, for example, the @CAPS1. There are thousands of books on the @CAPS1 and many movies as well. These materials should not be removed from library shelves because even though some people find them offensive, they can be used to teach people how horrible it was so that it does not happen again. People should inform themselves about something before they view it so that they are not offended by the content inside. Some content in history is very mature and should only be viewed by mature audiences.     The offensive content should not be removed from libraries because it is usually in a mature section and it has a right to be there. Most content that some people find offensive is for adult audiences. There are not children's books that talk about things that parents would find offensive to their children. The content has a right to be there. If the author or publisher took the the time to create the work, then they should recieve credit for making it. In the @LOCATION1, there is freedom of speech and people should be able to say what they want to say. If the content is too offensive then it should be removed but only under special circumstances.     The content in libraries, offensive or not, should not be removed. People can read or watch whatever they want. Many people have many different opinions on what should and should not be in libraries. The libraries are public and they are shared. No one person has the right to dictate what should and should not be in libraries. If it was not for libraries, the people in society would not be as smart as they are"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3530	2	"Have you ever wondered why a movie you rented from a library when you were younger, isn't there today? This is due to censorship. Libraries censor certain books if they believe them to be inappropriate for young children. Should censorship be allowed in libraries? Everyone has their own opinion, as do I, and I believe it should be allowed.     Censoring books allows libraries to withhold books, movies, magazines, music, and more from children who are not quite mature enough to handle the contents within the material, rather it be curse words in a movie, book, or music, nudity shown in magazines, or fighting shown in a video game. Young children look for role models, someone to follow, therefore, more than likely they are going to repeat what they hear or see. Some children are not quite mature enough to understand that it's not alway 'okay' to repeat what you hear, some words are inapporopriate for young children. Maybe they saw that on a movie, a man or woman solved a problem he or she had by fighting, the young child @MONTH1 take the message the wrong way, and try and solve one of his or her problem by fighting.      I believe that an age limit should be set for certain types of materials. Children that are under the age of @NUM1 should not be watching movies that are rated @CAPS1-@NUM1. There is a reason the rating is what it is. Just because your child is not allowed to rent/check out whatever the material @MONTH1 be, doesn't mean that you couldn't check it out, maybe go home and watch/listen/read/play it. If it doesn't seem to violent/graphic for your child then allow them to watch the movie, read the book, or play the game. That is your choice, but a library doesn't want to be blamed for your @NUM3 year old coming home cursing and fighting. My sister took my neice to the library once to rent a movie, it was a childrens movie, and my sister thought nothing harmful would come about it, but in one of the scenes, there was some arguing and fighting, and my neice began arguing with my sister, and hitting her, and my sister wasn't very pleased that they allowed that movie to be on the childrens floor of the library.          Censorship is a wonderful thing to have in libraries. Maturity level for some children is just not quite high enough for them to see/watch/listen/play certain materials. Not only should censorship be allowed, it should be enforced. I believe all libraries should have to have censorship in their library"	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
3543	2	"In Katherine Paterson's writing she tells us that she does not want her child to pick up a book off the shelf that could be found offensive. But I think that there should be sections of the library that are cut off away from the public eye, but are still there for those certin people.     If my child were to pick up a book that was not for his/or her age group I would not get made, because I know that some of the book groups are close to others them some, but they are for everyone to see, which could be offensive to some. I would tell my son/ or daughter that that book is not for you, and we would go and pick out a new book to read.     Over all I think that there should be sections of the library that are made for a certin age group, and should not be seen by kids. Because once I was that little kid, and went wondering through the miles of shelfs to find a really wonderful book to read, but long behold that didn't happen, I had wondered along to find a book that was not in my age group.     So I think that there needs to be more careful eyes in the library staff to make sure that those kind of things will never happen again."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3556	2	"No, because people likes different books, movies, music, and magazines. If people removes them so people wont come back to that libraries. They will go some where else to get the movie or what ever there getting. Some peoplpe want them to remove it but some don't want them to be removed.           If you don't want your kid's to read them , leison to them, or whatch them don't let them get them"	1	1		1	2	1	2																		
3566	2	"Should offensive or graphic books be removed from the libary? Well,in my point of view I think books, music, movies, magazines, etc.. are amazing, exciting and fun to read or watch they should not be removed from the shelves in the local libary. For a fact people in general have many types of tastes in books thier's drama, romance, action and many other that also apply to movies, magazines and etc. The public should not be punished for one's intreast in themes, and how they take the book. Thier should be an age limit in witch kids can't read certain books and those of age should read whatever they please.          I, myself  like to read scary books, they give me chills and all types of questions runing through my brain. Someone else from my community could have the same trait of thought I have when reading a scary book. Without books that don't fit are personality thier would be less people in libaries reading and more people trying to keep themseleves occupied and half of them might even get bored and start commiting crimes, to keep there self  occupied. People in the community have rights to read, hear or watch witch ever type of material they like.      If people really do have a hard time with some of the material that is on display, they should not even pick it up to begin with. They should look for stuff they would enjoy, not just because the book is about 'violence' or just simply don't like the theme they, should not hold it against other people that might enjoy it. Books and other material were meant for us to enjoy them and from the authors or directores choice to share with us thier stories. Without books like those many people can't get ideas to help them creat thier own book or novel.      So that is my view on the situation, people should enjoy whatever material they like. But, if you are one of those people that think books, movies, magazienes should be removed, take a day and read a book or see a movie from your local libary and see how it will change your mind"	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
3568	2	"I do not believe that censorship should be an option for people that find a book, magazine, or movie offensive. I believe that if a person decides to take a book off the shelf because he/she is offended, they are obviously paranoid. If a few cuss words are found in a book and a person doesn't want their children to read that book, then don't allow them to get it. Don't make all of the other people suffer. Censorship is an unnecessary solution to something that isn't even a problem. You know what they say, 'If it ain't broken, don't fix it.'      @CAPS1 of all, people have a variety of opinions. Some people think that violence is ok and some people don't think it's ok. If one person decides to put a book off the shelf because they find it offensive, what will the next person think? They @MONTH1 find violence perfectly acceptable and they might allow their kids to read the book. Then it would create a big conflict.     Lastly, parents need to allow their kids to grow up and mature. They also need their kids to know the difference between right and wrong. If they don't read books or movies with violence or cuss words when they're young, what will they do when they discover it when they're older? As a child, it is a time to learn life lessons and begin to form clear distinctions between right and wrong. Shielding your children from it will only hinder their progress in figuring things out and learning to think for themselves as adults.     Censorship is the same thing that @PERSON1 did to prevent people to think for themselves and discover that his tactics were a great evil to society. In other words, censorship is part of fascism and should not even be considered in @CAPS2 society. The citizens of @LOCATION1 have the responsibility of exposing the truth and teaching our children the differences between right and wrong. It's one of the ideals that help make this country great"	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
3578	2	"Today in society there are many things people have different views on. They can be religion, race, or brought up in a different way. Today in libraries there are many books of all types. They can relate to all different kinds of people. If one book is discriminating against another indivual is this right? I think the libraries need to stay the way they are and leave things the way they have had them for different reasons.       First off, no one is the same, what might be bad to someone else can be good to another person. If someone simply doesn't like the context of a book, movie, or even music ect. They don't have to read,watch,or listen to it. Since no one is the same what someone might not find appealing can be amazing thing to another person.     Second, this can be there for purpose. The @LOCATION2 wasn't always a equal place. If there are books that talk about the discrimination on other races I think it's simply showing history. If we didn't have history to look back on we wouldn't be able to see how @LOCATION1 has progressed. From slave states to all free states. I think it is important for material such as that to be left so it can looked on upon.     Third reason, is a library is suppose to consist of these different things such as books, movies, music ect. If we were to take everything out the libraries that comes off offensive it wouldn't be a place were you could find things that you wanted. It would probably be a boring place. If theres no variety in a library I don't see how it can be called a library. You can find whatever your looking for in a library whether its on how to do hair to the hitsory of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2.     In conslusion, these reason make up why libraries should stay the way they are. One is because what might be offensive to a ivdivual might be different to someone else. Second, it would take a lot away from history. Thrid, it wouldn't make a library what it is today. These are ligetament resaons why it should be left alone"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3583	2	"I do believe that certain materials such as books, movies,magazines ,etc should be removed from the shelfs if they are found offensive.  I think offensive books movies music and etc should be removed from shelfs becasue that is basically encouraging young children that if they see something innoproperiate its okay to watch . I would not want my brother or sister to watch, or see anything thing that is not approperiate.  I remember there was a time I was thirteen years old and my mom and step dad at the time did not agree that I should have @PERSON1,@CAPS1 or @NUM1 on my television, They thought that I was too young to be watching what was on @CAPS2 and it was innoproperiate in their opinion. I disagreed with that, I thought I should have the right to have watch it because I liked the shows and they were interesting to watch. Everything that was on @CAPS2 was not as bad in my opinion. When I would watch music videos on @CAPS1 every song that was being played was the edited version. I had to argue and prove a point in why I should have @NUM2, @NUM1 on my @CAPS2.   Parents all have a different opinion in what is good and what is bad for their children. In my case my mom did not want me to watch anything that was bad. She knew what it was like when she was young. She thought that maybe i would think what i see on @CAPS2 is not a bad thing . I was thinking to myself that oh well i am young and i will eventually learn in the long run from what is good and what is bad"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3588	2	If I was to right about to a news paper that are childing should not be looking at book and shoud be tacken off the shelf. The reson I say that is so are cirlden are not geting ideads from a book that is not aproprit for them. I thank that is the mane reson there are more girls geting pragnit at a young age. I thank if we were to tack off the notey book there would be less girls pragnet.     I realy thank it could work if we would tack all of the notey books off the shelf and mack it a law that you hade to be a sherton age to look at them. I would like to see a chang in the way we look at notey book. I thank you should be @NUM1 to look at books that are notey. It would be a good thang to try for a wiyel. I thank it woukd work because it would not been showin to are childer and they would not whant to have babys as a teenager.     This is the way I thank it should have been done in the farist place. We would not have so miny probloms in the frist place. The than is I thank thay not thak it well be to hard to race a chiled at a young age. If we would not have to see thans that we shouldent have seen.	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
3589	2	"Censorship is a growing problem is today's world of literature.  Censoring does not always allow the author to thoroughly convey his or her ideas as they were originally intended to.  Katherine Paterson says that if were all aloud to eliminate things that we thought were wrong, then there would be nothing left to be right about.  Censoring leads to an ignorant, opinionless, and clueless society.     In the novel '@CAPS1 @NUM1' censorship is one of the main themes of the story.  Bradbury portrays the burning of books as the way of ending all controversial opinions.  @PERSON3 finds that the burning of books has lead the society that he lives in to be ignorant of what is going on around them.  The government has tried to rule out all causes of controversial opinions in hope that it would make for a happier society.  When in reality, members of the world are not happy and are consistently showing the reader that they do not know how to be happy.  @PERSON3 decides that he wants to learn, but he does not know how. The brain is a muscle, if it is not excercised correctly, it becomes weak and useless.  So when he tries to memorize a part of the @CAPS2, he cannot retain what he has been reading.  Such as trying to fill a sieve full of sand, he does not know how to learn.     The members of this novels society are basically opinionless on what is happening in their world.  What they are told on the television is thought of to be factual, and that is what they do all day.  In school, kids are being fed fact after fact and are expected to agree with what they are being told with no questioning involved.  In a normal society, learning leads to questioning.  But for them there is no learning, just accepting.  And acceptance leads to contentness, which in the end leads to unhappiness.     The society in '@CAPS1 @NUM1' proves to be oblivious to everything that is going on in many different ways.  To them, death is not a big deal.  @PERSON2 was killed by a speeding car, and @PERSON4, @CAPS4 wife, was not even shocked to hear it.  Another example is when @PERSON3 was running from the police, and a car full of rambunxious teenagers attempted to run him over just because they wanted to.  At the end of the novel, @PERSON3 is walking along the railroad tracks with his new friends and the entire city is blown to dust by bombs dropped by fighter planes.  The city had no idea that this was going to happen, they were clueless to the war that was going on around them everyday!  A clueless society is a useless society, and in the end they were destroyed.      Censorship lies within the hands of the viewer.  Censorship has become such a big problem in the world when there are so many other things people should worry about.  Reading about somebody doing drugs will not make a child want to do drugs, it crosses every teenagers mind atleast once.  But instead of not allowing them to even realize that it is out there, parents should do what they signed up to do, teach your kids right from wrong and hope that you did it well."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3596	2	"Should They or Should They @CAPS1?     What do you think? Music, books, movies and many others have been questioned either about there apperence or what they say. Most people bring up the fact that young children should @CAPS1 be hearing this or haveing to read about it at such a young age, but the children have ideas of their own. In my personal opinion i do @CAPS1 think that they should have to be taken off the shelf or from being sold. What does everyone else think though? Is it a bad idea to keep them up and let the kids learn about it at such a young age or does it help teach them @CAPS1 to be like that?     One of the main reasons why I think it should be left alone as is so that the children can read it. They must learn the good from the bad sometime. Its better that children learn at a young age and just trying to keep things from them will make them want it more. Lets use music for example, some music is nothing but screaming and cursing. In real life though alot of kids have to listen to there parents fight and yell. So, why dont they get the choice to listen to it whenever they want to?     There are also the bad things to keeping them out on the shelvs. As a mother and also a teenager I feel like as if  I should have the choice to do as I please but at the same time there is no way I would ever let my daughter hear or read some of the things I do. That get me to my next point. If you really have a problem with some of the things out there why would you let your childern get it. As being a teegager I would go out and buy a lot of music I shouldnt be listening to, but even if my daughter was @NUM1 there is no way I would let her get it. After all I am the parent right? I have every say in what my daughter can and can't do. So do you over your own child. If other parents have no say in what there child gets just because they don't care, well thats @CAPS1 your problem.      There should,however, be age limits on what some are allowed to get parent permission or @CAPS1. Books with sex scenes and murder should @CAPS1 be allowed into they @NUM2 year old books. Sure, teenagers think they know it all but they still shouldnt be allowed to read something that adults do. Most @NUM1 year olds don't hear about all the drugs, sex, or teen prganacy. As much as they should get information on it, have there parents pick out what book they should read to find out about that kind of thing. I think that in every library that has sexual books and alot of curse words should be put in a specific location that only adults can get to. Video games have to put an age limit on things so why shouldn't books have to have the same exact thing? The only reason they have'nt done anything so far is beacuse @CAPS1 enought parents care.This is your chance to get up and show them that you want to make a change, that you won't let your kids hear about things without your knowing.     This brings me to my conclusion. Where are the parents out there? Why arn't you stepping in and showing people the right way to live? Make your nearest library have age limits on what the little young ones can read. See if the books you are letting your son/daughter check out are age worthy or @CAPS1. Last but @CAPS1 least try to talk your libraien into makeing groups of books. Some for the youngre kids some for the older. Woulnt kill for you to put your say in and try to get this kind of thing under control and @CAPS1 just removed. Why remove other people's interests when you can just put an age limit on it and @CAPS1 let your child get a hold of it. Today is the day!!Make a say!!"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3623	2	"I don't think that anything that gets checked out from the library should be censored. Some of the people that go to the library aren't looking for material with offensive language and/or themes. On the other hand, there are some people who go to the library who find that having offensive language spoken when it was meant to be is better than censoring it.     Take for example a book about @PERSON1. It could have some things in it that people could find offensive. But if someone has to write a report on @PERSON1, it would be best to have as much information on him as possible. I will make one compromise: if there is music being checked out with offensive language, they should provide it with both a clean and explicit version of the album.     There are ways that censorship can be good, and some ways that it could be bad. Some people find bad language and themes offensive, while others find that it gives freedom to the artist or author. I think that uncensoring things in the good and bad form is better than not uncensoring things at all"	3	3		3	3	4	3																		
3624	2	"A kid walks into the library up town. He looks around and finds a movie one of his friends recommended to watch. He checks it out and goes home to watch the movie. Later on, his parents come home to see their son acting out of the ordinary. He starts to say rude comments, being violent, and using profanidity. Who is to blame? The friend who recommended the movie, or the library for having this movie on the shelves and letting the young kid check it out?     Today, many libraries have a variety of books, movies, music, and magazines to choose from. Some libraries even have computers for kids, teenagers, and adults to use for certain things such as business, personal mail on websites, or games for kids to play.     But are all the libraries meeting their requirements? Some people find many books, movies, music, magazines, and even websites threatning. Libraries have movies that are rated @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @NUM1, @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. They @MONTH1 also have music that has explicit lyrics on the @CAPS5. Some libraries @MONTH1 not meet their requirements and that is why libraries do not have as much business as others.     In my opinion, I think that if a library has offensive material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and websites, they should be removed from the shelves. If the librarians are letting young kids check out explicit music, and @CAPS4 movies, they should possibly be fired. From my own experience, I have not had trouble with libraries and materials they have to choose from. I have not visited a library that has had explicit music to choose, all of the bad websites are blocked on the computers, and all of the magazines are appropriate for all ages.     In conclusion, libraries should have respect not only for people, but for the materials they have. They need to show respect for the books, movies, music, and magazines they provide for kids, teenagers, and parents. Censorship is required for every library and I think that all the libraries around do meet their requirements."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3629	2	"People from all over the world have many different opinions. If someone doesnt like something they do have the choice of not looking at it. Therefore, I believe that when you find something in a library that comes offencive to you you should not be able to remove it.     One main reason why I feel that the offensive things shouldent be taken out of the libraries is because, not everyone @MONTH1 feel the book, movie, magizine, or music is offencive. People have their own opinions on everything, and if someone takes out a book or any thing in the library because they feel its bad, the other person is going to miss out on something they like to read.     Another reason I feel the bad things shouldent be taken out of the library is because, some people could get mad at another person for taking all the offencive things out of the library. Many people like the offencive things in books, movies and soforth. I think from my own prospective that I like having a little bad in my life and if reading a book, watching a movie, listening to music, or even reading a magizine is what it takes I want to be able to go to a library and pick out something good with out haveing to worry if its there or not.     In my own opinion, I believe that with out offencive remarks or words there wouldnt be any humor in books and stuff today. Just because the offencive things seem rude and unapproite doesn't mean that they are. It's just something said to make a book or anything interesting and funny.     Although some offincive things in libraries can seem too unapproiate, I believe that if they're there then obviously there not too bad, and they shouldnt be taken out because one person feels that its not something that belongs in a library. Everyone has there own opinions in life and sometimes keeping them to yourself is the best thing to do."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3630	2	"There are numerous books and movies which are deemed not appropriate for younger audiences. By marking movies with a rating, and marking books with a specific age group, it helps categorize them.      In our public libraries, all books and movies are settled into one place for everyone to have the ability to check out. There is the ongoing discussion on whether these should be available to everyone. If a child were to check out a book, and it happened to be rated @CAPS1, the parents would most likey become upset with the library for giving the right to the child to check out a rated @CAPS1 movie. There is also the instance where a parent would have the child check out a specific movie with a @CAPS1 rating. In which the library would be harrassed for not letting the child check it out. Furthurmore, should public libraries let certain age groups check out movies/books which are not appropriate? The logical answer concludes to no, they shouldn't. If a child can not see a rated @CAPS1 movie at the theatre, why should they be able to check them out freely at the library? Public libraries should invest in a way to keep underage kids from checking out inapropriate materials. By simply having their age on their library card, there would be a lot of misunderstandings taken care of.      Our public libraries should take it into their own hands, by changing their censorship. It would give them a better name, and give our children a secure place to gain access to these matirials."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3636	2	"I believe that if there is a book in a library that a child is not allowed to read that the book should be some where the kid shouldnt be able to get it. I think those types of books should be stored in the part of the library were a child shouldn't have access to. Also the library should have a section to where only the certain age can read that book. In some libraires there are a bunch of books that are not made for a child to read and they have them to where a child can get access to them and that shouldnt be allowed. So i believe that they shouldn't allow children to get access to those types of books.     The same thing applies in a store. In some stores they have a magazine section where there are bad stuff that a kid is not allowed to see. I know in the grocery store that i go to there are inaproperiate images and words that a child should see or read. So there should be an area inside that store that a certain age can access them because one day i was in the store and i saw a little kid reading a magazine and saying the bad words that were in it and looking at the bad pictures it also had in it. So that is the reason they should put the magazines in a place were children shouldn't get access to them.     In the same store there is a music section and there are children in it all the time. The music is not all that bad its just that the kids can take these off the shelves and take it home and listen to it. This is the part that is the parents fault by buying the @CAPS1 for the child to listen to. So if the parent buys the child that @CAPS1 that is bad it is the parents fault. But i think that the @CAPS1's for little children should be in one part of the store and the @CAPS1's for the older people should be where the can get access to it.     This same thing applies with movies. There are movies in stores that are rated from @CAPS5, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1@NUM1, @CAPS6, and even for @CAPS7 audiences only. In a bunch of the movies form @LOCATION1@NUM1 abd up have a bunch of stuff in them that a child should not see. Like in the @CAPS7 audiences only movies they show nudity and a lot more stuff that no one under @NUM3 shouldnt see but they have some of those just sitting on the shelves at stores. So children shouldn't be able to have access to those types of movies.     The reason i explained all of this is so children dont get ahold of them. Like in the music if the kids start listening to some bad music they will start saying those bad words and get in trouble at school and anywere else. Even if the chid reads a book that has bad stuff in it they will start saying those words or even do the stuff that happens in the book. In the movies that a child is not suppost to see like a gory action movie or a movie that shows nudity or even a movie that cuses that child will see that movie and will show there friends or get ideas form the movie. And these are the reasons why a child shouldn't be allowed to get access to this kind of stuff."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3643	2	"When u go places there will alway be something that one won't like not everyone likes everything. A library has to be the worst place for people not liking things. Censorship in libraies is getting worse and worse everyday, it is in everything in books, movies, music, and magazines. Should we keep things like this on shelfs? Everyone that will read this will think differently about censorship in libraries.     On the shelfs is lots of things with bad laugauge naughty pictures. These books little kids can pull off a shelf and see things that there parents dont want them to see. Censorship is everywhere not just in libraries. The books and things in the libraries need to be changed and not be so bad. If there is a need for things like this Then have a special store for things like this"	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
3645	2	"I think certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because the word is just saying 'OFFENSIVE', or those things should be placed where not everybody can get it, like the little kids or when your religion doesn't accept that kind of things. For example in my opinion there are some books, music, movies or magazines that show images or words that are offensive, and not just for me or other people too. Offensive for me is when its not an appropriate thing like certain images, videos or bad words that should not be use  for everybody to hear or see. You have to be careful when you think something is offensive because not everyone thinks like you, and everybody has a different opinion and conclusion and we have to remember, we have the power to talk, read and write what we think is best. I'm not saying that they should prohibit certain books or music, I'm just saying that there is time for everything and we are young and we are looking for a good future, not just for us also for the younger kids and the older people have to provide us the best they can, because they have experience and they know what is best for their kids. This is a free country and people should express their opinion and make it worth, if you think something is being bad say it, and its important to remember do not let people offend you with words or images and don't let them force you to do something offensive for someone else"	3	3		3	3	4	3																		
3654	2	"In my opinion I believe all types of material should be allowed in libraries. If someone takes offense to a particular topic or section they dont have to read it. Not just certain types of genre and themes or magazines. Everyones different meaning they have differents personalities and views on what they like. I think libraries such actually expand thier variety of books.          Libraries that don't cater to a persons desires or interests , what would make them want to stay?  Libraries should be filled with all sorts of subjects appealing to everyone. Just like how they have an adult and children section. Everyone has a place were that feel like they belong. Even if some people get offended. A person can get offended anywhere not just by a certain magazine or some music style.      I do believe if there is a certain line of respect of course. Nothing should get to out of line were it's an issue with a numerous amount of consumers complaining about the same topic. You can tell if a certain section or material is crossing the line. Each section should be written to speak the truth but also in a respectful manner.      In the times that I've been to the library there @MONTH1 be some things that I don't agree with how certain things are certain ways. But then I see a person really enjoying their time at the library. I know when I go I always find  my style of music that appeals to me. Not just the same thing everywhere I go. Theres always a choices, different options and more things I can learn about.     Keeping all the materials like books, music, movies, etc is a way to appeal for everyone. I person should have their opinion and the choice to be able to read what they like. There will always be a certain movie or book you don't care for ,but others might. If everyone told what they like and don't like about a  certain book. Where's the variety? What books will be left? Everyone has their on thoughts on what they like, if theres a topic you don't like you probably know least about it. And the library is a good way to search and find information about anything"	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
3655	2	"This essay is all about wether certain materials in libraries should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive to some.     I do not believe things should  be removed from shelves in libraries if they offened someone. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't mean its offensive to all . If you are offeneded by somethings they display there are ways that you can avoid seeing them. One thing you can do to avoid it is never go by or around the shelves displaying it , ask for help so you get whatever it is that you need , or try to search what your looking for on the internet.     When i visit the library I already know what im going to get so i have never found anything offensive to me. If I did find something offensive to me I would complain and if they didnt do anything about it I would just never go back. I would just research online or go to another library where I know they will meet my needs.      The libraries I go to always have sections seperating the different age groups. The sections are split into children , teens , and adults . I' ve been to the library numerous times and I have never heard anyone with a complaint about something being offensive. If the library had something that would offense me I wouldn't know. Everytime I go I stay in one paticular section for teens and look at magazines and books .      I feel that if people are offended by what they see on the shelves they should just avoid or ignore it because everyone has their own opinion on what offends them and what doesn't"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3662	2	"Everyone has a favorite book. And some of us can't put it down once we read the first sentence. Then days later, the library takes it down and states that it's offensive to many people that have read it. Why should multiple people lose a good read just because someone doesn't like what they see? We're all trying to accomadate to everyone and their needs just to please them. Whatever they ask is done because we don't want a big scene. A majority of people think, 'That book is offensive! Take it down! Disgusting!'. But why?     Everyone has a right to read what they want to read. No library should uphold to the needs of a minority about an 'offensive' book just because they say it's inappropriate. Who are we to judge what's good for everyone and what's not? Books are written for a reason, and that's to share the ideas of the author, not to corrupt society with their 'evil' and 'offensive' ideas that could potentially cause a child to rebel. That excuse is ridiculous. A parent should've taught their child to differentiate between right and wrong, and if they use the '@CAPS1 child will become a rebel if they read this!' excuse, then they're not confident in their childs capability, or the fact that they taught their child well.     Also, it's not just the readers getting angry, it's the author. How bad would someone feel if they spent a year or two on a fantastic book, just to have it banned from library after library? Probably angry or upset. Authors have the right to write whatever they want. If they wish to talk about dragons and princesses, so be it. If they want to discuss why we see a full moon when we do? Go right ahead. No one can stop great books from being made and they certainly shouldn't be able to stop people from reading it. If someone is offended by a book, then don't read it, simple as that.     Parents like to protect their children from harms way and bring them up as fine citizens of @LOCATION1. By having this desire, the parents do every little thing to make sure their son or daughter doesn't see, hear, or read anything inappropriate or 'bad'. This is just ridiculous. Controlling a childs life will just cause them to rebel more and more as they get older. Let children have a choice in what book they read, or the movie they watch. Parents need to teach their children right from wrong, and in doing so, letting them see, hear, or read whatever they want should be no problem.     Without books, movies, and music, what would the world be like today? No one knows. Books are a great source of information, letting the author express themself as well. Movies are almost just as harmless, limits are needed, but overall? There should be no problem. Also, music allows the artist to bring out their side of creativity and emotion. Allowing that music, or movie, or book to be made, and then take it away is ridiculous. If it offends someone, then that person should just forget it, instead of taking it away from the people who love it and the person who made it."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3669	2	"I do not think books should be censored from the shelves of library's. Katherine is correct in many ways. We would not have any books if everyone removed the ones the disliked. The world would lose alot of information on important things in their worlds. I'm writing this to explain why I don't think books should be censored.     I don't think book's should be removed if they are offensive to some people because they, sometimes, help people see the errors in their ways like a book about gloryfiying the way white men and women treated @CAPS1 @CAPS2 men and women. now a days people would read that book and if they were racist they wouldn't be after that book,because they see how wrong @CAPS7 is. Music is freedom of speech, some artist's see themselves as 'liberaters', 'idol's',and even 'love spreading',yes their are some songs that could be 'seem' offensive but you'll never know how high a @CAPS3 will grow if u cut @CAPS7 down In example the song titled '@CAPS4' by @CAPS5 @CAPS6,@CAPS7 has catholic churches furious because they automaticly assume she's disrespecting @CAPS8 when in reality she's speaking a whole different tone.     People learn special, powerful  life leasons from things or situations that are shunned by our society and @CAPS7 will probably always remane that way,we don't know.But one thing we do know is we can change what we do in the present and better what were going to do in the future."	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
3682	2	"For as long as people can remember books have been banned for various reasons. Whether it be a time of war or a religious restriction, it is always viewed as a negative thing and therefore should be no different today. Though it @MONTH1 be a bit less extreme, books or content such as movies, music, or magazines should not be removed from library shelves based on someone else's opinion. It is a right to be able to obtain the information theses materials offer. No material should ever be removed from a public library based on censorship.     Some @MONTH1 argue that certain material @MONTH1 be offensive to other groups of people, but who is it to judge how another feels.  Material is written or made to show the feelings of the author and how they want thier feelings or knowledge portrayed. The author is merely taking advantage of their freedom of speech. It is at the responsibility of the public to how they use the information they receive. It is still a piece of history and was recorded for a reason.      Religion is always a hot point when it comes to censorship, but is that not in our constitution. Freedom of religion includes how we interpret and study our religions. Most have holy books and writings. Many express their religion by means of music and culture. It is a right for the public to be able to access this material.     There are some rare situations when restrictions @MONTH1 need to be upheld but merely based on age. This however doesn't restrict the public, but offers parents the right to censor what information their children are able to get ahold of. An age limit on specific types of material could be added in the cases of sexual content, vulgar images, or distrubing content unsuitable for children. This way information is never censored completely.     It is never right to tell people what they can or can not know. It is a part of the very structure of our country to allow all information to be shared freely. Censorhip of these materials is not and never will be the answer. Although, age restrictions @MONTH1 be an answer for younger citizens these materials aren't taken away from the public. Whatever it @MONTH1 be called, book banning or censorship, it is a negative thing and should not be a part of our public library systems."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3688	2	"Censorship in libraries? That could be a good and a bad thing. Is it really that big of a deal for kids to see some bad things in books? Will authors remove their books from libraries?     Censorship in Libraries is not as needed as most people think. Children now a days know a lot of things and are intelligent about certain subjects. I understand parents dont want their children to read books containing drugs, @CAPS1, sex, etc. Their going to have to learn about it sometime in their life though. They might as well get ahead start on it now. Young children most of the time are not even interested in going to those kinds of books anyway. If you censor all the books in the libraries then some students would be in trouble on projects they @MONTH1 need those kinds of books for. Say I needed a book on '@CAPS1' for a project im doing in @CAPS2 class. If the books are censored then I would have no sources to get information from.     On the other hand, I can see why adults would want the books censored. No parent wants their child coming home from school talking about sex, and drugs they saw in a book at school. If I was a parent I would be concerned myself. If it's that big of a deal to some adults then what are they going to do when their children see the same stuff only worse on t.v. Commercials about condoms, and advertisements telling them to use drugs/@CAPS1. Atleast with books, the book is teaching you about the drug and how dangerous it is for you.      If one author takes their book off the shelf because they don't want children reading it, then that gives all authors to do the same. Which could mean that we would have no books on the shelves for anybody. Books are a key to learning! We need to keep ALL books in the libraries no matter how explicit they are. Parents should sit down and talk with their children about not picking up those kinds of books if they don't want their child reading them. Yes, I have seen people pick those books up and start making jokes about them, but thats what children do when their immature. You have to expect that from kids now a days. No matter how bad they are their informational books and we need them to learn"	4	3		4	3	3	3																		
3694	2	"I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies etc. should not be removed if they are found offensive. The library has different sections for different groups like the yound @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 section, easy children or picture and @CAPS1.      Young @CAPS1 or the @CAPS2 section is for mainly the teens. They have books that a teen who normally read. The @CAPS2 section has music which teens listen to. For @CAPS4 they have the twlight soundtrack. This section does not have any explicit language.The teens who go into the library actually enjoy the select of books offered to them.It has everything most teens like to read about. There is nothing offensive in this section and it should not be removed.     There is also a childrens section called the easy or picture book section. This section are for the younger children. Children that are not in school or in the early stages of school. The books, music an movies in this section are cartoons an animals. Things that children would like to read, listen or watch about. For @CAPS4 this section has movies like strawberry shortcake, athur, even lilo and stitch. eveything in this section is made for children there is not one thing in this section where the child or parent who think is offensive.     The library has a section for adults. The @CAPS1 section is there to catch adults eye. It a separate fom the @CAPS2 and Children sections. It is located at the other end of the library. If there is an @CAPS1 who thinks that something is offensive they have the right to talk to someone who works at the library. Most adults do not have a problem with the items in thier section. The library keeps the adults section with things that adults would want to look for. It would not have something little children would want.      The entire library is split up into different sections. It is easy for the children to look at books for them and for adults to do the same. There are only a few that I named but every age group has a specific spot at the library. If there is something found offensive to the people I dont think it should be removed because it might just be in the wrong section. The library takes great precaution to the censorship of their books, movies music etc"	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
3699	2	"My views on censorship, I don't belive in any type of censorship. Books, music, and movies shouldn not be censored.     When it comes to children, it should be the parent's responsability to choose what they feel children should and shouldn't read, watch, or listen to. Taking books, movies, and music off selves isn't fair to thoose who want to read, watch, or listen to them or to the authors, directors, or musicions.      People should have the freedom to write whatever they want, the reader dosen't have to agree or enjoy the things the author is saying, but it is his freedom to say it"	2	3		2	2	2	2																		
3712	2	"Hello, I am writing to you today about my concerns about my views on the cencorship in a library.   First, I think some of the music they play and listen to can be a little graphic. I know some of the music that is being played can deprive the feelings of others. Music should have meaning and instead of blood and killing it should be about the better things in life.   Second, I would like to talk about some of the books libraries have. I think if they want adult type material they should have a section just for adults. reading sould be about what you like but it should also be about what you are able to read.    Next, I would like to talk about some of the inapropriate magazines that some libraries feature. Some magazines show off a little to much for some of the people that go to the library.Most magazines that are show are for adult and teen over a certain age.I believe they should make a section for each of the ages and age group.   Finally, I would like to get on some of the movies they let people check out. Libraies has a graphic selection of movies that are easily in the reach of young children. Children do not need to know about any of those types of things at all. Libraries need to learn more about there surroundings before they continue what they are doing.   In conclution, I believe that everyone has the right to a library I just feel everyone doesn't have a right to have everything libraries hold. Bad things create bad minds and we have to learn to stay above those influences.Libraries need to change some of there ways and there selections to make things more sucessful on thier behalf"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3716	2	"Should libraries remove offensive reading material? No, I don't think certain reading material should be removed from libraries just @CAPS4 some people find @CAPS5 offensive. There's offensive material everywhere. Just because you find @CAPS5 offensive doesn't mean someone else does. In my opinion if a person finds something offensive they shouldn't look at @CAPS5 or read @CAPS5.     A few months ago I was at the library. I was trying to find a book to read for an essay I had to write. I over heard two girls talking. They were arguing about something. I moved closer to them so I could hear. '@CAPS1's this one about?' The girl asked. 'That's a really good book! @CAPS5's about these two people who fall in love and their love lives. @CAPS5 goes on to talk about how the man tries to find a woman after the girl he fell in love with dies, and about his love life after @CAPS6's gone.' The other girl said. 'So you're saying @CAPS5's about sex?' The first girl asked. '@CAPS2, but only slightly.' The other girl answered. 'I'm not going to read this!' The first girl said. '@CAPS3 why not?' The second girl asked, confused. '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 talks about sex! Teens shouldn't be able to check out books like this.' The first girl answered, '@CAPS5 sends the wrong message.' @CAPS6 added. After those girls left I went and got the book they were talking about. I started reading @CAPS5. Intresting. Actually, @CAPS5 was a very good book. The second girl was right. @CAPS5 wasn't mainly about sex. @CAPS5 was mostly about the love those two people shared for each other and @CAPS1 the man went through after his love died.     That got me thinking. Should certain reading material be removed because @CAPS5 talks about sex, drugs, murders, ect or @CAPS4 someone finds @CAPS5 offensive? No, @CAPS5 shouldn't. There's offensive material in real life and @CAPS5's not being removed. Why should @CAPS5 be removed from a library? @CAPS1's @CAPS5 matter if @CAPS5's in a book? There is always going to be something somewhere that offends someone. That's just how life is."	3	4		3	3	4	3																		
3721	2	"The belief of certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are offensive, depends on the situation the material is relating to. If one wants to see these type of resources, then he/she must be mature enough to withstand it. It all depends on where the material is at in the library and what situation it's in. If it is in the children's area, I highly suggest that it should be removed from there, since it's clear that a child should not process this type of information. If it's in the teen section, then the person must be mature enough to take this sort of inappropriate matter or just leave it be. In the adult section however, there should be no argument of any sort because it is obvious that the person must be fully mature to take in this sort of material.      One example on why this sort of aspect on whether or not inappropriate material should be removed are the comic books called '@CAPS1 tales' or '@CAPS2 the @ORGANIZATION1'. These type of materials have some from inappropriate to disturbing events in the books, but have been distributed to the teen section. Now from ages @NUM1 years of age usually spend their time there and would likely read this type of information. Some teens would be horrified of looking through these books and others would be fascinated by it. It varies through the people and what type of material they would like to read. It all depends on the situation where this material is distributed in.      Another example on whether or not inappropraite material should be taken out of the shelves is how movies are put in situations. There was once a time, a young lady around her early teens who wanted to check out a type of movie in which she have never saw before. So once she checked it out, she watched it with her parents and saw some uneasy sections during this movie. The person should have thought this through before jumping into the situation. If the person was mature enough to go through this matter, it would have been fine; but she was young still and so it made the matter worse.     Whether or not inappropriate material should be removed from shelves depends on how and where the material is distributed and so it shows that one person can change the difference in the situation.Therefore whether this type of material should be taken off the shelves depends, once again, on the situation it is at"	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
3722	2	"Books, music, movies, magazines, we've all had the pleasure of seeing/reading/watching our favorites, but many are considered unsatisfactory in their content to younger children. Parents, now than ever, are concerned about how their children are raised, and are always looking to clear inappropriate things away from their lives. Things with heavy violence, gore, language and even scenes of sexual content, all of these are wanted by all parents to be censored from their childs' eyes. There are many reasons why parents worldwide wish to hide these things from the eyes of the young, such as; personal influence, emotional growth and even the chance of a child becoming disobedient to the parent. These are all valid reasons why some things should be removed from the public eye.     Again, we've all read or heard things that affect us personally, maybe you read on how you can make your life happier, or maybe you heard an inspirational song that conviced you to follow your dreams. Well, this is also true for everyday books, movies, magazines or music. If someone is introduced to something telling of a life with hatred or someone living in a violent way, it can influence a young reader to wish to live the same style of life if it sounds even a little remotely fun. True, children are encouraged to have fun, but to a certain, but safe extent.     These are even known to affect someone's emotions. Maybe a great song that made you happy, or a movie that made you laugh. But it is true the opposite way as well. Songs that are dark and have a gloomy feeling to them can make a person feel depressed, or a scary movie @MONTH1 leave a person with a new fear or a nightmare in their sleep the same night. It has even been known that some children are left traumatized for life just because they weren't ready for what they saw in certain violent and gorey scenes. These are all things that parents want to keep away from their children in order to keep them safe. People are very easily moved by any form of information, song and story alike. It is our responsibility to keep the good influences around and keep the bad ones away.     Children are easily affected in behavior, maybe they just saw a movie of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and thought he was so cool and they wanted to be just like him. If a child is exposed to a movie of great violence or bad influence, the child @MONTH1 then start following what happened in it and begin not listening to their parents. It is only right to keep these bad influences away until they are able to handle things so violent or misfortunate.     So yes, certain materials should be taken away from the public eye, for the safety of the community and for its' children. Books, movies, music, magazines - We've all seen/read/listened to them, but what have they influenced on you? Have you become a better person for doing so? Or a worse one? Or maybe you weren't affected at all? We need to be careful about what is available to us and to the rest of the world. Keeping the bad things away from our children and from anyone who can be influenced in a negative way is a top priority for any one person, group or business."	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
3725	2	Hello my name is @PERSON1 one day me and a friend were in the librairy on @DATE1 @TIME1 looking at some books. Later that day my @CAPS1 and I were at school reading our books she came up to me in the hallway. @CAPS1 said that her book was offensive and she was going to tell somebody about it. So school went by the bell rang it was time to go. When she got home she went and told her parents he parents said that she should go and tell the librarian.      On our walk to the librairy @CAPS1 and I stopped at the store to get something to drink. While were were there she got a newspapaer to read about what was going on at the scool when she noticed something about books about how they needed to be taken off the shelf. when we walked in the doors to the library the librarian was sitting at her desk she asked us if we needed any help. @CAPS1 said no but I need to talk to you about a book the librarian said she was way ahead of her. That she had already had complaints about the books and she was taking them off the shelfs. And moving the to the back closet.     About a week or so later @CAPS1 and her mother were reading the newspaper about the library it said that all the offensive books were being taken off the shelf and they were replacing them with newer and better ones. Some people thought it was wrong and they shouldnt do it because of one person said it was offensive but they did it any way.	3	3		3	3	3	3

3736	2	"How much hurt can someone take from a book, popular music, a movie, or even a magazine, etc.? Well, as shown by studies, @CAPS1 ctizens @MONTH1 take what these items say more offensivley than what it @MONTH1 seem.  They @MONTH1 seem to go overboard or exaggerate what these updated articles are spreading across @LOCATION1, but is it really true?          Due to all the diffrent races @LOCATION1 sees every single day, sometimes we @MONTH1 @CAPS2 be doing our best to accept their diffrent cultural backrounds in our modern day society.  I have noticed just by going to a pretty much all white school how most people judge other races other than their own, wheather it be making fun of what they wear or how they talk, etc.  Sometimes I wish they could just consider that we are all human beings and no one deserves to be treated that way.  Taking this all into consideration, I think that wheather or @CAPS2 they are racial books, magazines, or movies they should @CAPS2 be removed from there distribution around the world.       I know that wheather or @CAPS2 that these books, movies, magazines, or music are racial they should still be able to be heard by those who want to hear it.  I think that there are some people out there, for example myself, who like to watch movies and read books about slavery, the holocaust, etc.  It's a part of @CAPS1 @CAPS4 and I enjoy learning about it very much.  It @MONTH1 seem racial though to those who went through these hard times and these items which try to explain the pain these people went through @MONTH1 just seem like a joke towards them to make fun of all they went through, eventhough it is @CAPS2 meant that way at all.  I also understand that there are people who write books about mexican jokes, black jokes, etc. or even make comedy movies joking over diffent races.  These types of things I think should be taken OFF the shelves everywhere!  These are the types of things that I feel are what bother many different races and make fun of their cultural backround.       When it comes to music these days, it seems they always sing about love, being hurt physically and mentally, and so on.  I feel like music shouldn't really have an affect on diffrent races, unless it is purposley made for the reason of making fun of people.  I don't see where magazines can be harmful to a certain cultural backround.  The magazines I read about aka seventeen magazine seem to comment about how beautiful these people.     Overall, I think that making fun of diffrent races around the world is never going to get better if we never do anything to help it get better.  Eventhough all these diffrent items such as: movies, magazines, books and music @MONTH1 seem racial I think they should be left on the shelf of every library to let people watch and understand more about the @CAPS4 of our world, but if it is a truly written book, song, movie, or magazine article that is aimed to hurt someone of a diffent race, that should definatley be removed from every shelf around the world"	4	3		4	3	4	3																		
3740	2	"In Libraries there are many books, magazines, music, or movies that @MONTH1 be found offensive to many, but it might be what some people like to read; therefore we must keep all of the materials no matter how crude. These library materials are all part of the worlds past and all have a bigger story behind it which has an even bigger story behind it and so on. If we start removing books and everyone removes one then we are going to be left with nothing to learn off of. The world will be less intellegent and we start to forget and lose our past. This is the reason that we must never take any books, movies, music, or magizines off the shelves of a library for it @MONTH1 be special to someone or @MONTH1 be crude to others but it in the end they all contain some past that no other book @MONTH1 contain.      A world with no so called innapropriate books, magazines, music, or movies would be a less crude place but it will be stripping people of knowledge that @MONTH1 be needed. If everyone took a book off the shelve than none would be left. The books would start to lose their love, compasssion, and livlyhood within them. Other books @MONTH1 contain segregation and segregation is a big part of americas past. The word negroe is offensive for some and if we took all of the books with the word negroe out than we would lose @NUM1 years of americas past that cannot be forgotten. Documents containing stories of wars, leaders, rising and fallsing of many empires and kingdoms would all be gone because the violance was to offensive. Many historic moments in the world's history woul.d be lost forever. We cannot get rid of offensive books for the sake of the world's past.     The world would lose too much history in getting rid of offensive books. If the books were put in there own section in the library than kids would not be able to see them causing this to be no  problem for young eyes to see. If you find many books offensive than you just should not go to a library because no matter what happens no books are going to be just thrown away for they have history within them. If we start deshelving books than soon movies will be going and than magazines will be limited to only say so much. I believe that if our kids cannot get to the section with offensive books then we will not  have to worry about them seeing the offensive materials. If we want to keep all the books and people are still trying to throw away offensive books than we should just have a section where offensive books should be and kids cannot get to. In @CAPS1 this is how we could censor books in libraries.      Books, Movies, Magazines, and music are a part of every country in the world today. It is was changes countries and makes them different, it gives them there own culture which we can share with each other. So no matter what we should should never try and take offensive or any kind of book off the shelves of libraries. Censorship @MONTH1 be needed but the offensive materials do not need to be taken off the face of the earth or thrown where no one could ever read it again. All in all we cannot get extinguish the flames of our past or we @MONTH1 never have a future"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3748	2	"Should certain books and magazines be removed from the shelves if found offensive ? YES! Children shouldnt be exposed to certain things. Some books and magazines are to explict for children at certain ages. Children should read books that meet their age group. If children read books that are inapporiate for their age they might start to act out that way. Parents should try and remove all books that are offense to their children because that can have a real bad affect on them. Children at a certain age group should read books thats on their level and apporiate for them.          Certain books, magazines, music, and movies are to explict for kids these days. I think they should all be blocked and out of children reach. If children started to listen inapporiate music and read offense books it might affect the way they act. Children shouldnt be exposed to things that might brain wash them. If kids start toread horrible book and listen to bad music imagine what affect it might have on them in the world we live in today!     I think parents should try and do all they can to keep certain things out of the reach of their children. Parents should protest and call meetings to make sure libraries are taking inapporiate things off the shelves for kids. Parents should want to keep kids far away form certain things that @MONTH1 appear offense. It will mean that they'll doing their job as a good parent.      Sometimes kids wont always agree with what the parent might say but they hav to realize it could be whats best for them. Parents shouldn't always want to be their child friend because, sometimes kids would run over you. I know from personal exprience because sometimes peoplecan take kindness for weakness! Being a parent you should already be prepared for things like this.     In conclusion explict magazines, books, and music should really be taken off the shelves from kids. It might expose children somethings that isnt always good for them"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3751	2	"Let your mind wander to a place of peace and tranquility. You are in a world of endless possiblities. To each side of you lies a vast collection of diverse adventures and anecdotes. You are in a library where each book holds the key to a door of knowledge and adventure. Looking for an adventure of your own, you drift down each section searching for the one suitable to your liking. Turning the corner, your eyes suddenly glance over to some books and magazines with provocative and inappropriate pictures on them that are blatantly out in the open for anyone to gaze upon. Quickly turning your eyes from the unfortunate meeting of offensive pictures, you race down the hallway to a different section. You think to yourself how unecessary those images were, now scarred into your mind. In most libraries, you will find anything you are looking for that can be contained within the confines of a book. I believe that because libraries are used by everyone of all different ages, races, and genders, that some censorship should be put into effect.       Some of the content found in libraries should be censored due to a diverse group of people in the world with different views, opinions, and morals. This censorship is @CAPS1 narrowed down to just inappropriate images, but religious, political, and cultural innuendo as well. Censorship should be evident in all sections of the library. I do @CAPS1 think that certain books should necessarily be removed from the shelf because of violation of rights to speech which includes written speech as well. I do, however, think that they should be sectioned off and clearly marked to warn unwanting eyes and ears of the material found there.     Libraries are one of the number one resources when researching, reading, or gaining information and knowledge. Most everyone has used, uses, or will use a library in their life. This includes children and families. Children do @CAPS1 need to be experiencing, learning about, or exposed to some of the content and material found in libraries. I do @CAPS1 think the books should be removed from the shelves, but put somewhere else where a child could @CAPS1 find it. Children have rapidly developing minds and are sometimes defined by the images that they are exposed to. Something a child sees is more commonly and easily remembered for a longer time than if an adult would see that. This shows that it is @CAPS1 good for a child to see such offensive things. Censorship, in regard to moving the books to a new location where a child can @CAPS1 stumble upon it, is the best choice.     Another reason that I believe that the books should @CAPS1 be removed completely, but rather taken somewhere else in the library, is because that everyone has the right to express their opinions and feelings toward a subject. Also, others have the right to express their opinions toward another's thoughts. Just because you find something offensive doesn't give you the right to take that away from someone. I think that if a person so desires such things and feels the need to read about them, then they have the right and the choice to do that. Although, people who do @CAPS1 want to see that should also have the choice to have that somewhere where they will @CAPS1 come across it. This is why the books should @CAPS1 be out in the open for all to see, but taken to a secluded section.     In conclusion, the best solution when dealing with offensive material found in libraries is to @CAPS1 remove it completely, but section it off from everything else and allow exclusive access to only those who so desire such material. Everyone should have a choice and a right to see or @CAPS1 to see certain material they might find offensive. In doing so, the library, I believe, will become a better environment to all those who wish to access and use it. More people will use it and the library will then appeal to everyone."	4	5		4	4	4	4																		
3753	2	"In libraries there are a bunch of books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. to let the general public check out. This topic about censorship in libraries is a diffitcult one because everyone has different views on things in life. Certain materials in libraries should not be remove from the shevles if they are found offensive by someone.           Being in a library there are lots of choices to see and check out. In a library, someone comes arcoss a book or a movie that seems offensive to them. That someone should just look at the other way because a library is for the general public. It seems to be harse about this, but it is not up to that person if the material in the library should or should not be in that library. The materials that are offensive to people could be in a special place in the library to comitdate everyone.      Libraries have the right to censor any type of material that seems or is offensive to the community. This is right if the community strongly agrees with their local libraries. If the whole community disagree with a library about a certain material then the community have a say in it.      Yes, there are books out in libraries that are offensive to a group of people, but that does not mean take that material out of the library. Our country, @LOCATION1, say that everyone has the right to free speech. @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 has banned books thats are offensive to @CAPS1, but other countries around the @LOCATION2 might have those books in their libraries.      There is a thick line if a certain type of material in a library is offensive or not. Someone should not have the right if a  book seems offensive to that person, but if the whole community says that the book is offensive then yes.      The libraries and the community have choices to not have a offensive book on the self. If it is offensive to everyone then it should be off the shelf. Censorship is a diffitcult topic to agured on"	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
3759	2	"In my opinion, I believe that if the only purpose of it is to read it then it should be in a library. Magazines, comics, books, music, and movies should be one hundred percent accessible through a library mainly because many people can learn many different things in many different ways such as visual leaners which are people who learn better by looking and observing the topic. The listeners which are people that would rather have something read to them instead of trying to read it themselves. And lastly, the readers, who can do all of the above and read!         I know not all people are literate but maybe visiting a library once in awhile would help them with it. but in order for that to happen, that library must have something more than just things to read because many illiterate citizens that have to work their way up to being able to read. I hope understand through my point of view     All I'm trying to do is to make sure everyone has a chance to learn how to read because being able to read opens up many possibilities but some people havent gotten to the reading stage yet. Why not start learning in a nice, calm, relaxing township library"	2	4		2	3	3	3																		
3761	2	"History is bond to repeat itself right? Well, we must make sure that this is a great opportunity to ensure our future @LOCATION2. By censuring items on certain shelves is like when your mother makes you leave the kitchen so you don't get burned. This is just a way to protect the minds of young ones, which are like little sponges soaking everything they see or hear up.      The effects of what @MONTH1 come are far worst than making it so an adult must reach a little high for the book they want to read. Making it so only certain material is available to young children and teenagers is a way to prevent the same racism, poverty, assinations, and religions protests of the past. The @ORGANIZATION1 prides itself on that children are the future, well, why not put in the effort to prevent the from seeing what the see or read?      I wish that when I was younger many people were trying to stop causes of such things as teen pregancy, drugs, alcohol, and abuse. But, there wasn't, there was a thirteen year old girl in my class who got pregant. She thought it was cool, because she read it in a book. This book she read wasn't hers it was her mothers and she left it on the table to take back to the library. Her mother forgot and @PERSON2 read that book. She told a bunch of friends and me about it. @PERSON2 said the book explained what guys wanted. She did that because of a made up story her mother checked out at a library.     This story makes me think about why they should put books on a different shelf or higher up. I have two younger sisters who already have to worry about being picked on; because of their clothes, their religion, the fact that they only listen to certain music. They should be able to go to school, and not worry about the book that they @MONTH1 grab at the library. My sisters are the inspiration for me to make the world in which we live a better place,well, my brother is too. But, my point is they should have to live up to the expectations of others, or the what's cool.      By censuring what children are reading or listening to is a way to make them be children. When they look at magazines or listen to music, they make discissions that could effect the rest of their lives. Just like how @ORGANIZATION2 has a new song out. The lyrics are inapporiate of many young children, but you can look it up on youtube. The lyrics of many songs or singles that have just been released are astounding. These songs show us why children are having children, or doing drugs. It is all caused by what they see or hear around them.      Our country has hit an economical low, and this is caused by the youth not taking life seriously. I think that if we could focus on the factors in hand, such as censuring we @MONTH1 accomplish something no one else has. To show the world @LOCATION2's youth is the future, and it is looking pretty bright. We each should take proud it making the children learn better, act better, and above all make their dreams come true.      If we have more students reading stuff such as, ' @LOCATION1, or To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2,' and enjoy them it would show that their dreams can come true fiction or non-fiction. It doesn't aways matter as long as your reading something that isn't stopping your mind to grow and develop fully.      Many of the young women in my sophmore class have read, ' the @CAPS3 series,' and they loved it which made them read other vamiper books. It shows we can read stuff that is stimulating and not just to make us act like celebrates who party all the time or go to jail. By looking at those magazines or reading books about those people teenagers think that everyone is doing it. To tell you the truth more people aren't doing it and have found other ways to stay occupied. We have say in whether or not the future is good or bad why not make the choice easier by elimating the ones we would choose for ourselves at the age of children picking up the books or reading the magazines; about @PERSON1 who just drove around with her baby on her lap. What choice are you choosing for you life?     In my personal oppion I believe children and adults should have separate televisions shows, magazines, and books. We want children to mature without the lies that everyone lives this way. These are the reasons as well as more to why censuring in libraries would help the impact of lies to children lessen. To add one final thing, would you tell everything you know to a five year old if you knew they would retain every word? I don't think I would want them to mature that fast, otherwise what is the point of life, or school. To go and learn what you already know"	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
3765	2	"Censorship in Libraries     The library presents to the community many different things for entertainment. They's a large variety of enterianment such as: romance movies, adventurous novels, dramatic music, comical magazines, and many others. Yet they're are some that have unappropriate things. I believe that any of the things in the libraries that have unappropriate things in them should be censored or removed from the public view. If this is done it will benefit our children's moral beliefs, the library's family image, and save money for better things.      Our children are the most important things to us. They are the future of our country and our world. They are the people who will be leading our country. We teach our children from a young age our moral beliefs. Yet, if they start seeing or reading unappropitate things that they can find at a library then their moral views will change. They will think that the things they see are okay in society because it's in a library.      If the library, which is thought to be one of the most educational places, has bad things then the image of the library will be thought as bad and dirty also. The library needs to censor the bad things to allow their self image to look well. Many parents won't want to take their children to the library if they know that there can be a magazine of death and murder laying out on the shelves.      The library would also save alot of money if they censored the things they have. Many of the pornagraphical things they have cost alot of money. Usually if they buy movies that aren't censored it cost extra. If they buy things that are approptiate they would benefit greatly. They could us that money and buy better books and at a lower price.     The library is a very important part to one's community. We need them in our lives and our children's lives also, but we won't take our children if we know that the things there aren't good for them. That's why the library need to censor the unapproptiate things so that the parents feel safe when going to the library. The library is a fun place to go, and it would be even better if everything there was good and not bad"	4	4		4	4	4	4

Would you want someone telling you that your life story for example was crummy and diddent like the way you worded things. Thats the way you talk it's because it's your life story. The way i see it is let our children of this generation learn all they can about the bad stuff so they can stay away from it and also infor them of the good stuff in life so there won't allways be in fear. Let the chinlden read what ever they want to read. So what they curse tell your @CAPS1 that its bad launguage. @CAPS6't get ride of good books movies music.(@CAPS3:) @CAPS4 because the Author has a diff veiw on life than yours.

Well im going to explan what I think about everything that's in the libraries. Like some stuff we should have in their and some stuff we shouldn't. I beleave you should have no problems with noise or anything while you are trying to study in a librarie.      There are some things in the world today that alot of people find offensive. Their are like people that are offensive and things that go on in our and your area were you live that are really offensive. When it comes to our libraries there are some things that need to be change and some thing that don't need bothered. There are some book some kids shouldn't be seeing in the libraries but to other people mite enjoy them. But I don't beleave that they should be taken off the shelf. They just need to be placed better where smaller kids can't get to easy.     You wouldn't like for some books taken off of the shelf because somebody thought they were not good for kids. They just need to be move to a shelf were only bigger kids can get to. When I am studying I like to listen to music. It helps me think what I am going and calms me down. But when I don't have my music playing I don't like when other people have there to loud. Thats one thing that need to be changed in the libraries. Some movies are really offensive and they should be removed from the shelf. Another thing that has been a problem is magazines. There are alot of all kinds of magazines with all kinds of stuff to read about and they need to be watched. I beleave if anything is offensive it should be taken off the shelf.      Some people freak out every easy and this world is every offensive and people need to think about other people. If they don't somebody mite take it the wrong way and it could get bad"	3	2		3	3	2	3																		
3774	2	"I disagree that certain material, books,movies, or magazines should be removed that are offensive to some from the shelves of libraries. There are three reasons why I argue this topic. One reason is that books, music, etc. that are inappropiate should not be in a section that a child would go and look for a book. A second reason is that for a child to check-out a book and the book is inappropiate, they should have identification to show that they are of age. The third reason I think that things like that should stay on shelves is because adults have books, movies, music,etc. for them for many reasons.     Ther should be nothing inappropiate in a library that a child can get a hold of. A child should only have things appropiate that they can grab so parents do not have to be worried about the things they child hear, see, or read. There are some libraries that will let a child get a magazine or book, and let the child check the book or magazine out. This is where th problem begin.     All libraries should identitify each child when they check-out a book, magazine, or music. that why movies are rated, so that a parent could what kind of movie their going to be watching. A parent should keep a close eye on what their child read or see.     I think that things inappropiate should stay on shelves, but I also think it shoud stay in the adult section of the library. Childeren should not be able to go in the section for the adults. The inappropiate things on the shelves could be useful for the adults in some cases. There are some material that a  adult @MONTH1 need to help in life.     In conclusion, childeren should not be able to get a hold of  inappropiate material in a library, all libraries should identify someone the inappropiate material,and adults should be able to have this type of material on shelves in libraries"	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
3775	2	"If you were an author, would you think it would be fair for someone to have your creation taken off the shelves because it offended someone? In my opinion, I believe that there are some references, considering movies, books, music, magazines, and more, that are inapropriate. However, I don't think anyone should have the right to take them off the shelves because they are offended by it.     If everyone had the right to take something off of a shelf because it offends them, we wouldn't have anything left. In my mind, everything could possibly be offensive to someone. For example, I read a book and they stereotyped the cheerleaders, just like everyone else does. The way they make all cheerleaders out to be is horrible. Considering I've been a big time cheerleader my entire life, I got a little offended because I'm not the way the book described them at all. After reading the book, I might not have enjoyed it, but it was my choice to read it. I wasn't going to @MONTH1 back to the book store and demand them to take it off the market because I, only one person, didn't like it.      My philosophy would be to just ignore the things you don't like, or not to purchase the item if it offends you. I know that the age of the targeted audience of some books or movies aren't always the only ones that come across them. For example, a child coming across a movie that includes inapropriate languages or scenes. That is when I say that you just have to keep walking by and only pay attention to the materials that are for you. Or parents, censor what you children see, hear and read about.      Moreover, I do not think it is fair for someone's artwork, whether it is music, a book, magazine, or movie, to be taken off of display or off of the shelf. Those authors or creaters worked just as hard as anyone else. Just because it is not best suited for one person, does not mean it isn't suited for someone else.      In conclusion, I don't think it is fair for items to be taken off of the market because it doesn't please a few people. I'm sure there is someone out there that will enjoy it. It wouldn't be fair to the artist, after all of their time and harkwork. Everything on the market could probably offend at least a few people in some way, but welcome to the real world. They just need to learn to deal with it, or ignore it like I do."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3776	2	"Without books we all would not know what we know now.Its just like saying without a heart your body will still function. Books today are basically telling you real life things that happen or can happen if you do anything. Personally books are made for a reason, whether some people like it or not. Books help you get a better understanding of many things someone else @MONTH1 not know,and or understand.The same thing goes for musis, movies, and magazines.      I clearly understand where some parents, guardians, and caregivers come from, but they have to realize that everything they think is wrong for our society today really is helping the next person. Also someone else is thinking different then they are. Books are another way of learning as well, they all are not bad for the younger or whosoever it @MONTH1 be. They also help you get a better meaning of alot of things. I am not only going to say that books are most peoples main problem, but there are some movies, music,and magazines. But some tell you what age it is suitable for. For movies they tell you things like '@NUM1, @CAPS1' and other things like that. Also for music all you have to do is look at the songs on the back or they have them with or without anything bad on it. Magazines they have many different varieties of things for all ages and you pick the ones you want for you or your child.     Everything is not all bad, it is what you feel is right for your child or whosoever it @MONTH1 be. You can not blame others for what they feel needs to be heard or said to some. You have to look outside the box and know that there are people who really need to hear, see, and or do. Just to better themselves as a individual. People are so quick to judge the next but really don't try to understand that everyone needs help and that just because your life or whatever @MONTH1 seem to be heading in the right direction at that time doesn't mean someone elses can't change.Those things are there for a reason if you dont like it then try a better way to get away from it.     Without those things in our life I really can see this world falling apart. We barely understand what some of the books, music, movies, and magazines are talking about so just try to  picture all that being taken away. Its not a pretty site, accept the things that we have now and use them to the best of your ability. They all are there for a reason."	4	3		4	3	3	3																		
3778	2	"Dear @CAPS1, The things we learn at such a young age really need to be changed. It would really help soicity.Here are some ways how.      All books are diffrent. Some @MONTH1 have offencive language. If books have offenceive language you dont have to read it outloud. You can always substitute other words in there for those or just skip over them like nothing happened.     Some books say sexual things in them that @MONTH1 offend a race of some type or a gender. If books are sexual for your age group then I would recomend choosing a new book. But no matter how you look at it. It could always be much worse than what it is.     Music music needs to be some cencorship on that. When your listening to the radio or a cd or ipod. You cant always censor that. the radio compianies need to do a better job at censoring them out of songs. Many young teens think its cool to use vulgor language.      Movies have diffrent ratings for diffrent age group. I'm sure no one would let a two year old watch a rated @CAPS2 movie. That kid would have nightmares for a week. so censorship woukd really help the parents out on choosing the right movie for family night instead of picking one that they have no clue about.           Magazines are nothing but gossip. Most magazines do nothing but talk about the bad in people or the good in them.There should be some censorship in there because it is a persons life who there talking garbage.      Some say kids are like sponges. Whatever the kid hears he will repeat. Whatever a kid sees he will try to repeat it. So whatever a kid reads or watches will probably be the same.      Things do need a little censorship. If we didnt have that its hard telling what the world would be like. The world would be full of a lot of people with no motivation what so ever and if we take things away then the world would have nothing to do.I know that when I was a little kid I would hear somthing on the radio and think it was cool to say. My parents would'nt know what to do to me. I kjnow as an adult i would'nt want my kids learning the stuff I did at such a young age."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3781	2	"Removing literature from a shelf should not be permitted just because you think something about it. Everyone has different ideas and opinions about what is appropriate and what is not appropriate. If you don't like a certain book or you do not want your children reading that book then don't take them to the library in the first place.     In a public library you have to be old enough to buy a library card to check out a book, so if you are old enough to have a library card then obviously you arent going to find a book that is innapropriate for your own age. You @MONTH1 find a book that is immature to you, but you do not have to read it. Men and women go to public libraries to learn. If you want to learn about something that is offensive, then you won't beable to if one person comes along and doesn't approve of the book. Is that fair? You tell me.     In a school library yes there should be a limit to what children can and cannot read. In a junior high school the standards should be different compared to an elementary or a senior high school. In an elementary children are required to read as part of their academics, but they are not old enough to want to learn about something offensive, therefore they will not need those types of books in their library. In a junior high school there should be a limit on the offensiveness but the students still have a right to know what is going on arond them. In a senior high school students should have a right to read whatever type of book they please.     Magazines are a different subject. Alot of times in magazines there are advertisements for smoking products or alchoholic beverages. Those types of magazines should not beable to be read in a school library. In a public library a person should have the right to read whatever he or she pleases.      In the end im saying adults and teens have a right to learn about whatever they like, but children should be young and innocent while they can. You cannot keep them shielded from commercials and people advertising these things themselves, but what you can prevent you should. Nobody wants their children growing up too fast, but do not limit their growth."	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
3783	2	"Does censorship really helf or setback our libraries? Does it try to mask @CAPS7 really might be happening in this world or does it try to make you feel all happy about this horrendous place that you live in? To one person a book could be very offensive and to their neighbor it could have a whole new, opposite meaning. Its all in perspective.     Personally, i think that taking out some of the 'offensive' book in libraries could be a diaster. In one book that we read this year in my @CAPS1 class was '@CAPS2 @NUM1'. This book was all about a distopia where people burnt books who didn't send the right message to society. People were numb to feelings and that could be the outcome of censorship in the libraries around the @LOCATION1. Libraries are a place that sparks imangination for all ages and if you censor things out then how is that suppose to happen?     Looking at books in the past that were defied as 'offensive' and taken off of the shelves at libraries and banned to read in @CAPS1 class at school, were mostly about womens rights and @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Some of then just had bad words in them and others about dystopias. If you took out all af those books that pertained to these topics how many books would you ave left? And for that matter, my best friend is an @CAPS3 @CAPS6 girl and we both have equal rights now and we both have jobs so @CAPS7 is the big deal with living in the past? Theres is also the fact that it is innevitable to get away from cursing everywhere you go. All along the streets, in schools and sometimes even in church. So if you are around it in real life then why can't you read about it?     Now when people who are all for the cenorship in libraries say something to the affect of ' @CAPS7 about the children, i dont want them reading a book that i think is offensive,' i say then cenor them. Its your own choice on how you raise your kids but other parents think that you should have an imagination instead of the same old, same old. Its good to have a varity of things to read that doesn't limit the brain.      All in all, i think people who would want to censor books are crazy and it could potentually be taken way out of hand and then a distpoia society would form. Children should not be dissillusioned on @CAPS7 the world is and could be. Think about that next time that you think a book could arise tension between people and think are you taking away rights of other"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3787	2	I think that all books that are found offensive or sexual shouldn't be taken off the shelves completely. I just think that they should be placed in a certain section of the library where kids should not be at or not allowed to go in like a section only for adults. I think if a kis see something they think is interestiong and will teach them something they didnt know before they're going to pick it up no matter what unless someone steps in and tells them not to.     I dont think kids should be exposed to all of that and some kids are getting ahead were they shouldn't be in life. If a kid decides to try and check out a book like that either they shall have an i.d. or there parent should be with them comfirming they are able to check out that book.     Many children I think are already exposed to things they shouldn't be around and books like that would just make it all worse. Some books send out really bad messages but then again that's only for adults to read it should be kept out of the way of children. Some kids could live in a fanasy world and have a split personality or something off of things like that and it could really affect someone badly.     If a parent wants there kid to have the book or dont mind anything about it then that's there choice they have permission. I know I wouldnt want my kids around that untill they were @NUM1 years of age or older but I know some parents dont really care alot about it. So my best solution for this problem is to keep those books and things out of the reach of children or have a specific age limit.	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3792	2	"I believe that if something is found offense to someone then it dosent mean its offense to someone else. In libraries there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc, some of these different type of things @MONTH1 come across as offesnse to some but others @MONTH1 enjoy it. Therefore it shouldnt be taken away from those who enjoy reading or listening to these things.          Some things such as adult novels and explict music are things people consider to be offensive. But what they dont understand is that some people actually enjoy listening or reading this material so taking it away from them is not right. Everyone should be able to have different likes in these areas. Everyone is not the same.     If you attend a library you should be able to find something that fits your style or sparks your intrest. If the things that people like are being taken away then its not giving them a wide variety of things they enjoy doing. Its more likely closing them out on things they like because other people dont like it or find it offensive.     Lastly, those that think that these things are offensive are entitled to there opinion. But so are those that believe that these things are good. There should remain a variety of different books, music, and other things that appeal to all types of personalities.     Everyone has a right to say weither they dont like something. But what you dont like someone else does. So to take away things that other people enjoy is unjust."	3	3		3	3	3	3

There are people that debate whether or not some books are too offensive to be put up on library shelves.  I believe that no book should be denied of this right.  Most children that go to a library already know what kind of book they want and are with an adult at all times.     Most libraries have children sections.  Offensive books are most likely found in the teenager or adults sections, not the children section.  So, to my defense, there could really be no way that a child would seek out these 'offensive' books anyway.  Children today are exposed to more explicit topics, but I doubt they would want to read a book about them.     Next, if a child goes up to the check out desk the librarian should be able to tell their parent or guardian that certain book is not suitable for that age of child.  Going back to my point of children usually go to libraries with their guardians, they should be supervised at all times while in a library.  If an adult cares that much about what their child reads they can easily decide what is offensive or not.     Finally, authors should not be punished for writing something they believe in or like.  They worked hard on writing and publishing their novels, they should be able to show them off.  If librarians do take off books for being offensive to some adults, a lot of books will be gone from the shelves.  The quote used for this essay explains this thought more thoroughly.  People should be able to read whatever they want, offensive or not.  Children being able to do this? Depends on the parent.      There is no way a child could check out an offensive book, take it home, and read it without their guardian knowing.  Yes, all parents do not care about what their child reads, so this could happen.  Just because some adults complained about books being too offensive for their children doesn't mean a revolt has to happen.  Those parents should just step up and be more strict about what their child can and cannot read.  Some of the most 'offensive' books out there are the very best to read."	4	4		4	4	4	4

Every one in the world is not all going to like all of the same movies, books, and music we all have different testes. That is why I think it wouldn't be right to just take the books or movies off the shelf. I think they make so meny different types of ever thing becuse we do have different beliefes like relegen, class, and cultur.     Music, there is rock, rap, hip-hop, country, jazz, and the list goes on and on. And if you just take it of the shelf becuse someone somewhere thought it was offersive we would not have music or any thing like that. I don't really have to meny thing that I get offened by but I do know that I have seen some showes that were that way and some people I'm guessing thought was funny.     Books, there are meny different gerens in that too just like music so if it has a bad work, or a rude annicdout some people @MONTH1 not like it. Books are good to read. It would be bad if they were all gone. Then it would be hard to learn or teach anything. Take for an example The @CAPS1 is one of the most read books in the world and if they just took it off the shelf becuse some people don't believe in it so meny things would change and releges are not going to be the same in any way.          That is the way is going to be with it all and most people do take offens to that. The way i put it in my head is that if they don't like it they don't have to read, watch, or leasn to it. Every thing in all of these bisnisses is in taking a resk. Its all about how you look at books, movies, music, etc.       So I think that just taking it off the shelf would be a bad chose for this. That is why we have our own free will and and make the choes that you want to good or bad, right or wroung. You might not think about it much but thing like this do happen it might not be in your town but some where out there in the world it will be happening"	3	3		3	3	2	3																		
3813	2	"Should we remove offensive items or materials from a public library? My belief is no because many people in today's society are pretty offensive themselves and the books are meant to show the life of fiction or fact and when you do censor something the other person will try his or her best to try and find an uncensored version of the same material.      Art books are another thing that should not be censored because the artist is not trying to be perverse or offensive he or she is just trying to show his vision of art in the form he or she feels people would find artistic.  Censorship is important in some ways but you also have to have an opened mind because someone who finds something offensive might not feel that way later on in their life.      So my belief is don't censor something because it might offend some, because there are many who probably don't take offense to it be it books,music,videos,video games,writing,or movies.      We are all going to have a democracy over if something should or shouldn't be appropriate.     So what are your thoughts censor a book because of it's content or leave it and let the people decide?      My thoughts would be censorship is moral but you also have to think it would be immoral to take a book away from a reader that might find this book interesting.      So please don't censor books from our public library, we need books that have facts or fiction in them but also have a great story in it's words.          My other thought would be what i would do is let the reader decide censor it or keep it the way it was intended."	2	3		2	3	3	3																		
3814	2	I think that that if there is a book in the libraries that is hurmful. Then you should  have to be at least @NUM1 years of age to check it out. The reason why i say @NUM1 is because at that age you should know whats right or wrong AND you can handle it if is wrong. I mean if you know its wrong then dont read it no one is maken you read it.     It would be differnt if some one waz but no one is.Some people like to read differnt kinds of books just because its not right and hurts you dont mean it hurts ever one it @MONTH1 make it helpfull to some one esle and if its tgaken out then there wont be any books in the libraries for anyone to check out and read. BECAUSE ever book in there is going to hurt some if u made them read it.     If you have have a problem with that you can contact me at @NUM3 ask for @PERSON1 and we can talk bout it and mabe you @MONTH1 be about to change my mind or after you read this you make think the same way as i do.      The reason i feel thinks way is because like i said before there is a part in ever book that will hurt some one so you should have to be @NUM1 to check out surten books.If ur getting hurt by a bunch of books then i would sugest you to stop readen because a book is a book not somthing to hurt you.There is so many people in the world that is into books and resourcen bout stuff.     What i do not agree with is that kids getting out of class going to the library playing games and putting puzzels togther that is the problem  i got.I mean yeah people do go in there and do work witch is find BUT some say that they have work and they dont.They just want to get out of class and not do work. People go in there and play games and when people need on the cumputer there is no were to go because of kids playing games.          But as the book part in the library i dont have a problem with that  thats what i got to say bout books hurting people is dont read them other people  like them being there for them.	3	3		3	2	2	2																		
3816	2	"Should books, music, movies, and magazines be removed if found offensive? Well i think that they they should be put to a vot for everyone, who goes to that library, to decide. That some might not find it offensieve as others do. No because people have different beleafs than others.     I think they should be put to a vote for everyone, who goes to that library, to decide because the staff might think its morally incorrect and morally offensive. But others like the people checking out the books might think differently then the staff. The staff is not the one who reads all the books their customers do.     Some might not find it offensive as other do because every one person thinks differently. No one person thinks the same reson unless they have been told what another person thinks. the library might loss its people if they take a book out for the wrong reason. Weather they like it or not all books teach a lesson about life.     No because people have different beleafs then others. In one culter that book might be aloud and they might live around that library. So that would make then miss out on going to the library for books. For example, if the library choose to take out the bible and romance novels then they would loss a lot of customers. Their business would fall.     The library staff should not be aloud to choose what books are aloud because if some one has a fine they get money.  So my answer is no because they shuld put it to a vote, some might not find it as offensive as others do, and people have different beleafs than others do. No one person has the same thought that the next person does it is impossible"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3822	2	"Libraries are often known for protecting our children and keeping an education atmosphere, however, you would be suprised the content our children @MONTH1 find in such a seemingly friendly place. With a simple library card, children could check out a   boat-load of information that could be teaching them lessons you would not want them to learn. But nobody can be looking over thier child's shoulders all the time. The answer to this problem is strict censorship.     Books are big, powerful, and a vast amount of information. Even though most parents believe publishing companies would intend on not letting children reading books that can be easily misunderstood, the truth is it's up to the library wether or not a book can be checked out. Most of the time, only adults can understand what the charaters in a book are going through. This @MONTH1 be because of the adult's extensively more experiences throughout their own life. Another comon belief is that seperating a library for the younger and older would solve this problem. The fact is, even if an adult checks a type of media from the older selection, this does not stop the younger child from witnessing or reading something as simple as a video or magazine at home. The only solution is to stop these materials from entering libraries and censoring the offensive, easily misunderstood media before it gets into the wrong hands.      Libraries are great for research or school projects, but books and magazines that are inapropriate should never end up in the place built for an education experience for your kids. Censorship has to be inforced to help keep and maintain our libraries educational atmospher and keeping our children safe from offensive material"	3	3		3	4	3	4																		
3826	2	"Knowledge @CAPS1     @CAPS2 you ever remove something that be misconstrued as offensive to someone, although you don't believe it is? Neither @CAPS2 I, and I dont believe libraries should either. Removing books, movies, magazines, and music from libraries is unconstitutional, and it seems to lean toward controling how people think, known as communism. Also anything can be found offensive by one party of people, and so everything @CAPS2 be offensive, and removed. Then libraries @CAPS2 cease to exist. What about in the court room? If one side of the story is not told, how will the jury be able to tell if the accused is guilty or innocent? Taking out certain 'offensive' learning materials @CAPS2 leave people in a bored mindless state of mind.     Do you want the government controling what you think? I didn't think so. In the @LOCATION1, modern day @LOCATION2, @PERSON1 did just that. He decided exactaly what went in and out of peoples minds. He did this by desiding what they could read, write, and listen to. That sounds like things you can get at the library, right? We can't have the government controling what we think, and mostly all libraries are government run. If we let them deside what we read and listen to, thats the first step in losing our freedom, and nobody wants to lose their freedom.     Lets say a white man goes into a library and looks at a book about racism, and how it has helped the nation. Then, at the same time, an @CAPS3 @CAPS4 women goes into the same library and gets a book on why women are better than men. Then they see each other, and the woman wants the mans book banned, and the man wants the womans book banned, and both the books are removed. Then neither party is happy, because both of their books are gone. The point is, anything can be found offensive, if you just glance at it, or look at it to much. Plus if everything can be found offensive, and all of the offencive materials get removed, then all the books and learning materials are gone. Noone is left happy.     If you are being tried for murdering someone, and the lawyer of the defendent gets to say their piece to makes it look like you are a murderer, and you don't get to defend yourself, what are you going to do? Your going to go to jail, most likly an innocent person, and your marked as a murderer the rest of your life, all because your side of the story wasn't heard. That is unjust, unfair, and unconstitutional. If we let this happen to our libraries, half the books will be sentinced to 'death,' without a 'fair trial.'     So, if you want to have an un-@CAPS4, communist, and unfair library system, that is your choice, but I believe that the way we do things now is just fine. No book should be banned because of its material, because noone, except the writer knows exactally what it means. People get to read what they want to read, and don't have to read what they don't want to read. Thats what the freedom we have is, you have a right to read, watch, and listen to whatever you want, and nobody can stop you. Do you want that to change? I know your awnser; it's a no"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3828	2	"To begin with, a woman might read a book about wifes and find it offense. But it was her choice to pick up the book and read it. Should it be taken off the shelf? No why should it. Different people have different perpectives on what they're reading. Not all people feel the same way. Samething goes for music, movies, magazines, etc. They might see a naked picture of someone in a magazine and not like it. It was there choice to pick it up and read it. No one held a gun to there head and said 'read the book etc.'      @CAPS1, why should a book, etc., be taken off the shelf if one person doesn't like it? You still have the rest of the population who might love it, some might just like it, and the ones who don't. You can't just think about that one person you have to consider everybody esle. If that person finds that book, etc., offensive then they should have chosen wisely the first time and/or never should have chose what they did. It's there own fault.     For my conclusion, nothing should be taken off  the shelf if its offensive just don't read the book and etc. Another person might read it and like it. Some people who finds things offensive are maybe looking at it in the wrong way. Keep the book etc., on the shelf if they take it off then sooner or later they will take everything off the shelf for being offensive. Then what we will be able to read or listen too"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3833	2	"Censorship in libraries should not be mandated. Censorship should not block the the 'allegory' in some books that the author is trying to give a story within a story to the reader. Censorship would lead to @ORGANIZATION1 just like in @DATE1'. You could not the true meaning of an art piece that the artist is trying to show, so there could be no possible abstract art.     The word definition of allegory is a story within a story. It is where the author is trying to show to the reader. For example like in the book '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2' is an allegory. It shows many storys tying in with each other. When @ORGANIZATION3 dies on the side of the cliff by @CAPS3 when he launches the huge rock over board. That shows the fall of man. In the @CAPS4 where @CAPS5 eats the apple from the tree and that is why we sin. You just cannot censor such a great book. Very many people would not like that book because it shows young boys being savages and killing each other. Everyone needs to look at both sides of the story. People need to know the true meaning of what is being said.     Art should not be censored at all. Art is what makes people creative. The way artists make things abstract that could kindle some controversy. Also they make things that we use today that we just don't think about, that are utilitarion. Who would give you the right to censor thier master pieces. For example @ORGANIZATION2 had a dark period in his work and painted demon's in his paintings and people might think that is way too graffic. People need to see why he painted such works of what was going on during his life at that time.     Censorship is @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. This would to a book called '@DATE1' by @PERSON1. In his book he show complete govnerment @ORGANIZATION1. We as the people of our goverment would be classified as the '@CAPS6'. The @CAPS6 made the majority of the people and were not very smart people. Also could not think for themselves because the @ORGANIZATION1 censored everything you could think of. The @ORGANIZATION1 did this because so they would not have anyone try to be a rebel and over throw the @ORGANIZATION1. They knew that @CAPS6 could over throw them, but they were on top of their game and censored everying. This is what would happen if we censored everything. We all would have not personality at all. No one could express love the way we do now.      Censorship would in libraries would not be the most best thing anyone should do. No one would know what an author would be leading too, not a single artist could display their art. Aslo censorship would lead to @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. This could not work in our society today. So censorship is not the best idea anyone could think of."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3834	2	"Bad @CAPS1      @CAPS2 off yes, I do think think they should be removed if they are bad. If you wouldn't say it to your parents face when your at a younger age then you don't need to be listening to it or reading it.     I would not want my younger kids reading or watching anything that they know they couldnt say to my face. There are so many things that little kids can see. Like at any @LOCATION1 or any where there are magazines with ladies in there bra and underwear and its the same thing with the guys. I dont think its right they should they them put up where it isn't so easy for the little ones to see. Those kind of things are justy going to get kids asking question that make the parents have to lie.     Then theres kids watching tv and they have the stupid cartoons where the kids are on there cusing and talking aboout sex then your kid goes to that channel when your not around hear all these stupid stuff. Then their going to go tell there friends what they heard because they think its cool then all kinds of kids are hearing it. When you can just take channels like that off your tv and make everything easier.      I think the worst is liking people sign about killing people and raping kids and all this and that. I would never let my kids listen to music like that i don't care how old they are. I also think that is where most of the stuff kids pick up are  from the music they want to listen to its horrible. I would do anything to make it where kids coudnt listen to that stuff until their parents didnt care. I know my parents didnt like me listening to it when I was young and I see why now that im older and know what all of it means so i'm never going to let my kids listen to it when they are at a young age.     In all that I hope that I made a good point and hope you feel the same way. Why let are kids listen to the stuff that hurts them and us in the longt run it just not worth the trouble letting them do what they want."	3	4		3	2	3	2																		
3840	2	"Should we censor books in libraries? Katherine Paterson, an author, once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 provides a very valid point. If we start taking off book that we find offensive, there will be none left. Books are meant to provide information and insight into someone's life. If we take away that book, it would be like saying that person's idea did not matter. The main reasons why we should not show censorship in libraries are a loss of insight, books, and personal creativity.     Books provide insight into the author's life. Also the things that are happening in history affect the author's tone or style, like @ORGANIZATION1. During his lifetime, @CAPS2 was ruled by kings, so if he wanted to be successful, he had to appease the @LOCATION1. It also helped appeasing the @LOCATION1 since he was sponsoring @ORGANIZATION1's plays. Another example of an author influenced by his time and upbringing would be @CAPS3. He was alive during the middle ages, and he constantly saw oppressive things like serfs. When he wrote his tales, he made the high class people sort of mean while he made the lower caste people on the humbler side. @CAPS3 was not afraid to displease the @LOCATION1.     If we start taking off books from shelves in a library that we think are offensive then soon there would not be any as Katherine Paterson said. Where one might find information, another might find it highly offensive and vice versa. Every book would have someone say it was offensive. It might be the context or the tone or even the person who wrote it; it does not matter. Sometimes the books that are the most informative are the ones that are offensive. However sometimes it is good to have offensive things in books. It builds the tone and mood of the story or character. It might create a certain image. It also teaches us not to what these people are doing. The books sometimes show us a depressing ending of a person who lived a vulgar or criminal life. These stories teaches us life lessons. Yes sometimes I read a book that I find offensive, but I have learned that if I do not like does not mean someone else does not. It would not be fair then to take off a book that someone might have learned something from just because you do not like it. I am sorry, the world does not revolve solely around you and me. It revolves us as a whole, and if someones starts taking off books, who is to stop someone else from doing the same. It would not be fair.     Finally, if we started taking off books, it would start influencing kids in thinking it was okay to throw away someone's creativity. It also make them think that there ideas would not matter and no one would be able to appreciate them. I for one do not like doing things, if they might offend someone. I could not imagine what it would be like in that type of society.      Books are important to have. They teach us about events or people who were before our time or problems some people experience. It is important to be aware of what is going on around you. I grew up ignorant of big problems that were occuring in society. My parents tried to shield me from the bad news and creeps in society. Reading books is what opened my eyes to what life is really like. So taking off books from shelves would have hindered the process of me growing up. I would still be that ignorant little child thinking that life ends in a happily ever after. Unfortunatley most do not, but there are some that have a happy life. That is what books are for, to teach people about other people's experiences, the good and the bad. So @PERSON2 was wise in her observation. Who is to stop someone from taking off books once this processes has started?"	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
3842	2	"Lets think in todays known world the childern and teens have access to pretty much everything.     If you ask a teenager this same question should this stuff be tooken off the shelves. They might say no. If ask an adult how ever they are most likely going to say yes. The music that surrond young adults and childern isn't the best. Go ahead and listen you will be amazed. If they have access to it then they are going to take it and borrow it.      I feel that most of the music and movies on shelves anywhere should be taken off. Now thats just my opinion. Even adults listen to this stuff and watch all of this stuff. I say that the reason why people are failing school is because of all this stuff. @CAPS1 you think about it they have so many rights that they shouldn't have.      If there is anything offensive then it should be tooken off the shelves. They should be replaced with educational things. Lets go back to where it all began back @CAPS1 everytbing started to come out. Did you have most of this stuff growing up? You probably didn't. But now you can find anything almost anywhere. Which is kind of sad if you ask me. Magazines however are starting to bcome more like movies and music. Mainly with all the nudity and foul words that they show.      If you look at atheltes it doesn't matter who it is they get in trouble for things they shouldn't of said. @CAPS1 they should be out teaching kids not to say this stuff. That right there will help out educatiion and what not. You can become a more responible adult by showing them whats right and whats wrong. Starting with what they listen to or what they watch. I'm not allowed to watch current things and yet I do anyway. Thats because my parents aren't giving me enough discipline and they didn't @CAPS1 I was little.      If you let a child grow up to listen and watch what they want the odds they might not do good in school. One way you can help out is by hanging out with the chiold or childern. Even teens. Even though the don't want you too. Talk to them make conversatuions teach them right from wrong, @CAPS1 you teach a child right from wrong the outlook on school will be better"	3	4		3	3	4	3

I mean, why change something if only a few people doesn't like something? Thats only goning to lead to a big conflict. Think about if we were to tr and give everyone what they want, @CAPS1 would that work out not good at all. So you should just limiy thing dow and put them in setions."	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
3851	2	"A lot of people believe that books are useless and should not even be on a shelf. Well I believe that no book is useless nor should it be removed from shelves from any library. All books are worth something toward anything like careers, and being able to learn new things.          Magazines @MONTH1 not be any help towards alot of things like books are, but they are something to entertain you. Music is not just something you listen to, but its something to help keep you nice and relaxed while you are reading a book. Movies can have a certain impact on someone; alot of people think movies are just entertainment for them to watch, but it could have some encouragement, or it can really show how a person acts if you really pay attention and look into what the movie is saying.      No book, magazine, music, or movies should be taken off shelves because they are not there for you to read or listen to or watch, but those things are all there to tell people something about things people do not even know. People should take a second look at how all of these things can really affect a persons life. More books, magazines, music, and movies should be put in the libraries of school, or even the public libraries.The more people read, watch, or listen to these things the better they @MONTH1  understand life. I have noticed from experience that people just go to the library and read a book just to relax, but yet at the same time those people really do not understand what they are reading. Its really a shame that people do not look into what they are reading, thats why it would be important for more books to be put on the shelves. Just like Katherine Paterson said: 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf , the work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If people really understood what that quote really means then they would have a better understanding of what books actually mean in life. We should be thankful to have authors like Katherine Paterson in our life because these authors are there to help us understand the meaning of these amazing books in this world."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3853	2	"Censorship          @CAPS1 was the last time someone told you what you could, and couldn't do? Especially if it was somthing you didn't want to do. How'd that make you feel? You probably didn't want to do it did you. Censorship is somewhat the same way.     The other day, my friends and i wanted to go see a new movie that just came out. We weren't aloud to see it though. You know why? Due to censorship, we weren't old enough to be able to see this movie. So, now the only way we'll be able to see this movie is if our parents go with us. Have you ever had your parents go with you and your friends? Doesn't go so well does it. Censorship violates freedom of being different. You can't listen to music, watch movies, or even read certain books, unless your of a certain age. That's not fair. Censorship is like a modern day @CAPS2. Tells you what you can and can't do, how you can dress, and what to say. Everybody would be the same then. How did @CAPS2 do with his idea, he failed miserably. How do you think the @CAPS4 victims felt, they were punished for believing, or doing something different. They weren't hurting anybody, they just wanted to live they're lives a diffent way.      Thats what censorships doing, classifying people in to certain groups. telling them what they can and can't see, do, or listen to. Thats what makes the world different, people that are different. Dont't make everyone be the same."	4	3		4	4	4	4																		
3864	2	"KEEP @CAPS1 ON THE SHELF!     I think we should not get rid of any books that are in the library. If we did that then there wouldn't be any books left. The only thing we should be worried about is the rated @CAPS2 movies. Yeah those can be taken out of the library. If one book is offensive to someone, then dont get it, but someone else might like that book.      For example, an older woman is looking through this magazine, and she sees this teenage woman taking drugs, or being half naked. Although the teen sitting right next to her likes that gossip. We shouldn't get rid of any books because then we would only be down to one genre. There wouldn't be any categories left in the library.      A good idea is to separate the books, put the ones that seem offensive in the back. keep the childrens books away from the big mystery horror books. Another example is this. A student goes to the library to work on a history report over slavory, but there isn't any books on slavory because somebody thought it was offensive against african americans.      I understand that there is reasons why some books are taken out of the library because of some sexual content. Children do not need to be around those kinds of books. Or some books being taken out because of religious belifs. like one book being taken out because it was about worshiping the devil, or something.     The movie situation i understand. I wouldn't want my little daughter walking up and grabbing something that has a sex scene, or drug content in it. You can take those off the shelf, but wait, right there is another example of why it shouldn't get taken off the shelf. Just because i want it off the shelf doesn't mean everybody wants it off the shelf. Then the libraries movie business would be over.      To sum everything up, nobody should choose what should be in the library and what shouldn't. Personally i think that there should be a variety in the library. If not everybody would get bored of the same books. Over and over. KEEP @CAPS1 ON THE SHELF"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3875	2	"Censorship is one of many important issues facing the world today.  Many argue that materials considered offensive are damaging to society, and should not be tolerated.  Others believe that freedom of speech is a universal right that should extend to any and all forms of human expression.  The issue is further complicated by the concept of what is and is not appropriate for children.  Are there materials that are acceptable for adults, but not kids?  Questions such as this have plagued humanity for hundreds of years, and there is no simple solution.       Today, so many people think of censorship as a bad word.  In fact, there is nothin inherently wrong with the concept of censorship.  It is only when people begin to abuse their power and censor materials that should not be censored that problems arise.  For example, many countries have restrictions on selling and owning copies of '@PERSON2,' the book that @PERSON1 wrote as a sort of mission statement for @LOCATION1.  While many of the ideas contained within the book are horribly offensive, it still should not be censored.  People have the right to read the book and form their own opinions on @PERSON1's teachings, it is not the government's place to decide for them.  While oppressive dictatorship and mass-murder are crimes, reading about them is not.     There are few materials available that should rightfully be censored and taken out of adult hands.  If someone understands what they are reading, and are able to form an educated opinion on the material, then nobody has the right to stop them from expanding their knowledge, or expressing themself by creating similar material.  However, the issue changes completely when one considers children.  If adults want to view pornography, or read accounts of extreme violence, that is their business.  However, those concepts are obviously inappropriate for children, and any decent parent wouldn't want their young kids filling their heads with such things.  Children need to be slowly and gently introduced to these concepts so they can fully understand them.  In the case of children, careful censorship is necessary for healthy development.       When it comes to libraries, there are very few materials that should be banned.  If libraries are meant to be places of learning, then one has no right to limit the information they contain.  However, that does not mean there should not be any limitations.  Libraries should offer a children's section, as many do, that would contain materials only appropriate for youngsters.  Then, it becomes the parents' responsibilty to ensure that their child stays in that section.  When a parent believes the child is ready to explore the adult section, they are free to take their kid there.  This system gives parents the ability to keep their children away from harmful material, without taking it out of the hands of adults.  Many would argue that unsupervised children could gain access to inappropriate material, but that is really an issue that needs to be handled by parents, not the library.  After all, it's better that a few kids see something they shouldn't have than all adults have to read censored material.       In conclusion, censorship is a concept that has its place in society, but must be used very carefully.  When the goal is to protect people, especially children, from harmful material, it can be used sparingly.  However, when those in power use censorship to attack ideas they disagree with, it becomes a form of oppression.  Above all else, people must be free to educate themselves, form their own opinions, and express themselves.  If someone doesn't like a piece of material, they can leave it alone, but they should never try to take it out of someone else's hands"	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
3881	2	"Now take a moment and go back to highschool. Do you remember roaming under the opera house with the phantom? What about fighting for @PERSON2's freedom with @PERSON1? Perhaps getting people into trouble in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS1? No matter what your favorite classic piece of literature was, you recall the wonderful feeling you felt when reading it. It enveloped you into its world, and you felt every sensation it offered. What is this though? The author is a @CAPS2. The author uses occassional bad words. The author is a woman. This is not an acceptable excuse to miss out on everything literature offers. Censorship in pulic libraries is wrong.     The @CAPS3 was a dark time. Thousands upon thousands of @CAPS4 people were killed for their religious belief, as well as homosexual people, and other minorities. Amidst all of this chaos, the @ORGANIZATION1 decided it would be a good idea to burn all books written by @CAPS4 authors. So they did. Millions of books were eradicated along with their owners all because of a religious difference. Does it even need to be asked? This was wrong. Many say that ignorance is bliss, but is it really when people impose their ideas on others?      Let us now look now at what a book, movie, magazine, or song offends with to be censored. A curse word, a bit of skin, a controversial idea. Sometimes these are needed for emphasis of the compilation. Imagine how much less forceful an angry character would be without a few curses every now and then. Pathetic.     So is it worth it to you? Will you give up a beautiful composition because it is controversial? Will you hide your children from materials that will make them form their own opinions? One thing is certain, I will not. I will stand against censorship until it has felt the mighty blow that it has inflicted on so many beautiful works. One day my plea will be heard. Censorship in public libraries is wrong no matter how you put it"	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
3886	2	"When ever has a few bad things being said ever effected how or what people read @CAPS2 a days. That's what is hot in this present lifetime. No one wants to read a boring article, not unless it's meant to be. I'm going to share with you my opinions on certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, ect.,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I have observations, experience, and reading some of my the articles that were called offensive to prove my opinions.     In my opinion, no ones work should be taken off of a shelf due to any thing, because I'm sure they worked on it an awful lot for it to be placed on a shelf. So there is no reason for it to be taken off. If that was my stuff that had got took off the shelves I would be shocked and upset. So that is one reason why you shouldn't do that. It could hurt people emotionly.     Following that statement, but there can be times where you just don't want them to be seen because they are to embarrassing. Such as an athlete interviewed in an @CAPS1 article, that got suspended from their sport due to violations, and this athlete is just cursing and being out of control. I would put that article away also, just so the public won't see it and no one is put on blast.     Finally, @CAPS2 everyone knows that some types of movies, and music can't be put on display in public. So you would have to ask for the movie or @CAPS3 and someone will go get it from the back for you, due to explicit content or explicit lyrics. G-@CAPS4 @NUM1, should be the only movies allowed on shelves, rated @CAPS5 and up should be behind counter, and the same with music. I am pretty sure that is clear with this audience.     @CAPS2 that I have shared with you my opinions on different views on censorship in libbraries what is you thoughts on this topic as you read this persuasive essay. You have read my thoughts on experience, observations, and just common sense on this topice. If you had to write an essay on censorship in libraries, how would you come about this."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3893	2	"Censorship for books? Never thought I'd see the day. But, that doesn't necessarily mean I approve or agree. Just because I don't approve or agree doesn't mean I do not oppose it. I find that need taking a step back and arguing both sides is sufficient and fair. Shall we?      Among others, I find that if you censor one thing, you censor them all. Public items such as televisions, radios, magazines, and even books have wriggled their way into our not so perfect world. Yes, there are crimes and indecencies happening as you read this. But, is it entirely fair to say that these public items have completely influenced and brainwashed children into early adulthood? Maybe. Then again, maybe not.      It is true that children, at their youngest, are easily molded and cut out into who they will permenantly be, or at least until they're old enough to form their own opinions on certain topics.For instance, when I was younger, my cousin, who happens to be just a few years older than me, started to like a certain thing. After spending time with her for an elongated amount of time, I started to 'like' it too. I found myself obsessed with it. Now, before you start getting it into your mind that it was something bad, I can assure you, it was nothing other than stacks of @CAPS1 cards. Anyway, it wasn't until later that my mother informed me that it wasn't really my interest. It was hers. I modeled after her likes and dislikes. Every other child in the world has done something similar. What makes anybody think they wouldn't do the exact same after listening to uncensored music, watching uncensored television, or reading an uncensored book or magazine?      On the other hand, it would be unfair to take away some books that people find to be improper or indecent. If that were the case, nearly every book would be out of sight, but not out of mind. Today, you can't turn on the radio without hearing something about sex, drugs, alcohol, or smoking. Now, those things are a lot more accessable to anybody. You can't turn on the computer without advertisements for porn or other sexually crude websites popping up on your screen. Books have gotten out of hand, as well.      The world nowadays has gotten ridiculous and out of place. But in the end, I'm sticking to my original opinion: If you censor one thing, censor them all. It's only fair. Radios, television, movies, and even @CAPS2's have been censored. Books are not as innocent as they seem, anymore. So yes, my final opinion is that libraries should, in fact, censor their books, or at least make an effort to. Libraries are places to learn and have fun doing so, not have a mental scar leading back to what they read in a 'harmless' little book."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3895	2	"The things we find in libararies shouldn't be offensive to anybody. It's the choice you make rather you won't to read it or not. Nobody is making look at those things if you don't want to. Don't look at it, if you think it's offensive.     The best thing to do is to keep it on the shelves. Some people like looking or reading things like that. People don't go to the library and pick up a book or a movie that they know they wouldn't like. If that was to happen, then there wouldn't be any library around because anything you get from the library, I bet you can find something offensive about it. People find stuff like that entertaning when watch or read stuff like that.     That hurt the people that make the books and movies that are offensive because they feel like thats what people wan't to see. True enough thats what people won't see as long as it's not effecting them in no kind of way. That what we see on a daily basic on tv is offensive things, so if we can sit there and watch it on tv then we shouldn't have on problem reading or watching a book about it. I see stuff offensive on tv about everyday, but it doesn't bother me so reading a book or anything else like that, I woudn't care because i'm use to seeing it on tv.     Nobody can make read or stop reading things like that, only you can. You don't have to look at it if you think its offensive. It shouldn't be a problem with anyone because thats what we hear and see everyday. No matter what some people find that entertaning."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3901	2	"Human beings, like snowflakes, are very much alike in a unique way. Just as there are no two identical snowflakes, no two humans are exactly the same. As everyone has their differences, there are always those who have a greater sense of curiousity, and prefer to think outside the box. However, it is difficult for these curious people to extend their strive for knowledge, if they have restrictions as to what they can read or study. Therefore, if a person is mature enough, and desires to study or read upon a certain topic at a library, they should be allowed to extend their knowledge on any topic of their choosing, with permission of a gaurdian of course.     Unfortunately, it is often times a group of minorities that ruin something for the greater minority. Libraries often times take in account a child's age as a factor towards what a they can, and can not read, but age seems completely unfair to a child who is mature enough to read, and handle the more adult rated intell in a fashionable manner. If one is legally eligable, and they have permission from their gaurdian, then he or she should have no restrictions to the materials provided at any library what-so-ever. Who is one to say a ten-year-old is too young to learn about @PERSON1 and his horrible plans for the @CAPS1? A person is never too young, or too old to learn something new, if the curiousity and the proper level of maturity is present!     It is curiousity that has led mankind to discover something new each and every day. As well, it is curiousity that has brought mankind to the extraordinary level of technology, and inventions that it is at today. The youth of the present will one day be the engineers, doctors, scientists, and moving leaders of the future. If these young people are curious, and desire to achieve greater knowledge on a certain topic for positive reasons, then let them be!"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3908	2	"'@CAPS1 - @CAPS2 or No?'     Katherine Paterson's quote about offensive books is completely true, and I @PERCENT1 agree with her. She's saying that if everyone had the right to remove a book they found offensive off of every shelf, there would be no more books for people in the world. There are most likely books that one person could find offensive, but others do not. What would the world have left if almost all books are taken off the shelf? I do not think that offensive materials such as books should be removed from shelves because not everybody could find them offensive and could be depriving people of their favorite subjects, I've had my own experience with a supposedly offensive book, and because there would not be books left in the world.     There are books about every single subject in the world. Some are about subjects we love and could read about for days. Others are about subjects that we hate or that just plain bore us. Though whatever the subject is, whether it be about the media, science fiction, romance, or anything else, there are different people in the world who love reading about different subjects. If a person had the right to remove a certain type of book from libraries and stores, say a romance book, because she found it offensive in some way and it was taken off the shelves, then a person who loved reading that book would be deprived from it because one person found it offensive. Just because on person finds a book offensive, doesn't mean everyone else in the world would too.      I've had my own experience with a supposedly offensive book. In my @CAPS3 class, we were assigned to read 'The @CAPS4 in the @CAPS5'. As we were reading the book I honestly thought it was a very interesting story. Though later with some research I found out that the book was banned in alot of schools all over the @LOCATION1. Teachers from those schools reported that there were some very subjective words and events in the book. I do agree that there was some bad language, but I don't think that's a reason to ban the book from schools. It's an awesome story that won a couple awards, and my class also enjoyed it. My experience with this proved another point that certain books should not be banned.     Just as @PERSON1 stated, if every person was given a right to ban certain books from libraries, there wouldn't be books left in the world for people to read. There are millions of people in the world. If every single person was able to ban one book in the @LOCATION1, what would we have left? There would probably be nothing left. If every book was gone from the @LOCATION1, what would kids in school be able to read? Kids would start reading at a slower rate, causing grades to drop. One little law change in @CAPS1 could cause great negative changes in the future.     There's always going to be people in the world who find certain books offensive. That's never going to change, but people also have the freedom and choice to stay away from the book they abhor. Unless you're a student in school, you don't have to read or look at a book you find offensive, and you can also try to keep your kids from reading whatever it is because if you want one book banned off of shelves, your depriving other people of books. So I say every library stays the way they are now, and keep every book they have for all kids and adults."	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
3910	2	"Do you think that books, music, magazines, movies should be removed form a libraries shelf?     A libarys should carry every kind of book, movie, Magazines, Music etc.  The reason that a libary should carry every thing is because say a farmer wants to come in and get a book over cattle and some city person says that its no use and throws it away the farmer is outta luck or say the oppiset would happen.  Another reason would be a persons tasted some people like romance and some like action etc so if they dont carry one type someone will get mad about it and stop going. Say if @PERSON2 dose not like viloence so they take it off the shelf and @PERSON1 dont like chick flicks etc what would that leve in a libary no one would have anything to read and they would close the libary down because there would only be a few books.  The movies and magazines i would say carry anything that was approperat and if it was rated @CAPS1 you had to be @NUM1 to rent it then the person would be a adult. There is different cultures out there that only like certon thing so what are they going to do make seperate libarys so that each culture will be happy or just build one big libary and the ones that dont like just leve the book or whatever there.  Altmentley its up to the parent to tech there chiled noy yo pick up the bad items if there not liked by a certin family or cultuer.  If they would get rid of the stuff one person didnt like it would loss custmers and make others mad so in my eyes its better to have one person mad becaues a libary carryes a certian type of item then to loss custmers and make @NUM2 people or even two to make one person happy when it is as simple as dont pick it up.     So altimently we can not make everyone happy so just look over the items you do not like teach your childern not to bring them home and move on in life and dont start a problem"	3	3		3	2	2	2																		
3912	2	"No criteria such as books, @CAPS1's, magazines, etc. should be removed from shelves just because they are found offensive. The @LOCATION1 is a free country, which means that if you find something offensive such as a book or magazine, you don't have to read it.     When people get all upset over a book or movie they saw it really drives me crazy, simply because you don't have to go see that movie, or go read that book. Different people find different things offensive, this can be because of race, gender, ethnicity, etc. So we shouldn't start removing materials from shelves just because a few people find it offensive. Some people think it is offensive that proffessional athletes get paid @MONEY1 for playing a game, when there are homeless people living on the street. Never the less the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 is the most watched event in the world when it comes on. Just because a few people think sports are offensive doesn't mean they should be shut down for good. Another example is racial jokes, some people think they are funny when others find them very offensive. This still isn't going to stop people from telling racial jokes.      Just as Katherine Paterson said, no criteria should be removed from the shelves in the library just because some people find it offensive. People do not find the same things offensive, so taking material off the shelves would not be the right way to deal with this issue. If you find something offensive then just dont pursue it. Almost every single book in the worls has something in it that someone, somewhere finds offensive. If we took all of these books off the shelves, there would be nothing left to read. This is a free country, which means you have the right to choose whether to read or pursue something or not. So instead choosing to eliminate books from the library, just dont read them, because maybe somebody doesn't find the same things offensive as you do, and they might like to read that book."	3	4		3	3	4	3																		
3916	2	"Censorship is not an easy question to anwser; it involves a great deal of thought. When thinking about a topic like this you must look at a greater picture. You should think about after math like thoughts and opinions from everyone else. When it comes to censorship in libraries I feel that all the books should be left on the selves.      So, why would we take books away from people who want to read them just so that others don't? If you don't want a child to look at adult books, then you can censor them by watching them, and not taking them to places that have such books. This way other people can read these books.  If you truely think about it, then you will relize that if you are trying to keep something from a teen they can, and will, find a way of getting it. If you are trying to keep things from them that will only make them want it more.     Books are good for people. It tells them stories that cannot happen, past events they did not live through, and even the thoughts of others. Keeping books away from people is not good for them; they would not be able to learn from the things they read. So, maybe some books are more racie than others, that does not mean you should hide it from your children.      If you were to start censoring books in libraries it could cause some problems. Now you will have no books for some people. You will have taken most books out of libraries because one person thinks it is not good for the children. This will cause arguments over what should and shouldn't be in the library, and people will stop going to the library all together.     So, when you think about banning books just remember that there are other places to get books. Books are good for people especially teens, whos minds are developing. In some places books that are banned to other places are celebrated. When trying to get rid of books just think about the people you are taking them away from"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3917	2	"You go to a library to read books, music, and magazines, but soon you find out that there are very offensive books. I strongly say yes, I agree that we should remove the books, magazines, and music from shelfs if they are offensive to people. We are suppost to feel safe reading books, listening to music, and reading magazines. When I was younger I went to the library all the time. I would get books to read and look at, and for a while I was excited to go to the library, but all the excitment went away after a few bad exsperiecnes. Remembering the names of the books are not going to come to me, but I know I was so upset by how the book was. It had words that I never heard before, and I got confused. This could happen to many little kids that come across a bad book, but really librarys should only have good books not bad.After that bad experience happened to me I ignored it like it will go away or something. Bad books, offensive books, should be taken off shelfs for good and never to return. I feel very strongly about this subject, because I am a book warm, I love to read books and being able to go to a library and find a good book thats not offinsive is all that I ask for in a library. Offensive books, music, and magazines should not be aloud to be in librarys at all. When kids read books or listen to music they want to be able to disappear in them, but if there are offensive stuff out there, how will they be able to do that. There are things that should be left out of libraries and that is offensive books, music, and magazines.In closing to my essay I still have full curage in my answer, I still say yes, they should remove the offensive books, music, and magazines. If it was your sister, your daughter, or your neciece that went into a library and found an offensive book, what would you say? I ask you this, how would you feel?"	3	3		3	3	4	3																		
3922	2	"Books, music, movies and magazines are all offensive in different ways. They all are some how offensive to people if they have inappropreiate launguage or actions or stories in them. Should thease materials be taken off the shelf just because some people think they are to offensive to be on there and they don't want their children getting ahold of them?      When I go to the library I see different sections, fiction, nonfiction, ect. What I don't see is a section marked 'offensive'. Librarys don't do that. If parents or anyone don't want their children or any other children reading offensive books they should go with them and make sure they don't pick up offensive books, or have them wait in the childrens area.      Librarys usually don't carry offensive music. They have @CAPS1's for books to listen to. That might have offensive lauguage in it.  Before renting or buying the @CAPS1 you should ask someone who works at the library to tell you if they conscider it offensive or not. If they don't know then don't get the @CAPS1. Most of the time you know what your looking for before you go to the library anyways.      If movies are offensice they are marked rated @CAPS4. @NUM1 movies are the better ones. If parents or anyone do not want their children watching rated @CAPS4 movies before renting or buying one they should check the back where it always tells you. When I was young my mom would always check the back of movies because she didn't want me watching rated @CAPS4 movies. She herself thought most of them were too offensive for me to see.     Most of the time magazines don't have offensive lauguage in it but they sometimes have inappropreiate pictures of men and women. They also have a bunch of gossip stories you might not want your children to read. But if your letting your children read this then you should read it before they do to make sure for yourself there is nothing you wouldn't want them reading.      I don't think there is any reason to remove books, music, movies, magazines, ect., from the shelves if they are offensive to some. If a parent or anyone else doesn't want their children or anyone else's children to read something they think is offensive they should make sure they read something before they let them read it. Also walk around with the child in the library to make sure they don't pick up anything they wouldn't like, or have their child pick things from the childrens section. Some people like reading books, magazines some might think are offensive. Everyone shouldn't be punished for those who just don't want their children finding offensive things in the library"	3	4		3	3	4	3																		
3923	2	"Books, movies, magazines, or music that is offensive in any way should not be aloud to be showed to the public. If these offensive things were not aloud to be showed I personally think it would help out are country is full of racist people and documents.      Everytime you pick up a magazine or you watch a television show about a famous actress or musician you see embarrassing aspects of their lives all over the world. This is not right at all! People should be shown respect and allowed to have some privacy in there life. If it wasn't for actress and musicians we wouldn't have any television shows to watch. There would be no use to have radio's. There would be no reason to, their would be nobody to sing songs for us. Why would we want to embarrass these guys anyways? They work their tails off to produce new things for us.     Books in the libraries should not have sexual assualts in them at all. Books like this in school libraries have no reason to be there. Why would you want your child to read something like that out of a book in the school? Expecially foul language in materials at school. Books at the library should have good examples in them not vaulgar sayings. This is a disgrace to the school.      Movies are a big concern. Any child or young adult could go into the movie section and get any type of movie even if it is rated restricted. Would you want your child brining home a movie that had nudity in the film? I remember one time my little sister brought home a movie from are local library. This movie was a total disgrace to this library it had nudity, foul language, and lots of violence. I couldn't believe what I had just saw. My library would have something like this in the library? Children go there and pick movies out. My mother had went in and made a complaint about the restricted movies being in with the children films. She said that the movies should be seprate from the rest. You should have to be a certain age to rent this movie. Or atleast have a parents permission.     Every local library or school library should be taking action in doing this for their community. Lets keep are children and young adults away from violence. By allowing this in are school libraries and local libraries it is just saying it's ok to letting this violence in. We should put a stop to it and prevote good attitudes. So please take the violence off the shelf"	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
3924	2	"Are some materials, such as books, movies, magazines should be removed from the shelves if those things are found offenisve? There are some things in books are movies that are offensive, and that other younger adults shouldnt watch or read. Reading a book also says alot about certain topics that are offensive. But at the same time can you learn from these things such as finding it in a book or seeing it on tv.     So I dont think that certain things that are found offenisive should be taken off the shelves, because people should learn off of these things. Some people have a hard time understanding what's right and wrong in life, because their not getting the full effect in life and what it is meant. The problem I think is people @MONTH1 not think certain things are offensive because they might not know what it mean. Movies on the other hand has a different side of the fence. Movies can affect someone, especially someone who is very young. Those children can look what's on tv and copy exactly what they are doing. They also @MONTH1 be a role model which is not always good for some people.     Another thing is that music plays a big role in someone's life because there is sad music, loving music and also violent music. Music can define a person. For example if you are listening to a sad song, you @MONTH1 feel sad or depressed. Or a person listening to hard and violent music @MONTH1 feel upset or angry. Certain music that peole listen to can define who they are. Especially when i had said it determines what kind of a mood you are in. I think when people listen to the music he or she likes, it defines who they are, it shows what kind of mood there are in.     Secondly, magazines are an advertisement. It shows everything, it tells you stories. Just like in the movies if you see it, youre going to do it. But magazines are different, they show like the styles, and life stories of others. When you see things you @MONTH1 want to do things just as the what the magazine. Usually when you look in a magazine you usually see pictures so its not as big of effect as the others such as the music and movies. They more likely describe things.       Books on the other hand are similar. You can learn what's in a book just by reading it. So if a person @MONTH1 read something about voilence he or she @MONTH1 think it is right to do so. Even if that particular book is telling you what's right about the topic. So no I dont think that some books that are found offensive beacause only that person or indvidual can learn what being offensive is. So keeping these types of books @MONTH1 help other people who are readers."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
3925	2	"What is @LOCATION1's main idea in the area of art, language, and music? The idea of @LOCATION1 in those catagories is freedom.

It is one of the amendments in the '@CAPS1 of @CAPS2', known as freedom of speech.     Saying that, I believe that we should not be able to ban, censor, or remove any books, music, or movies from the @CAPS3 public. It is their right as an @CAPS3 to buy what they want. It takes away @CAPS2 from people, and when they do that, it makes citizens feel like toddlers. They can't choose for themselves what to see and what not to see.     Everything in this world can be offensive to somebody. Just because that one person finds something bad or distasteful, doesn't mean that they have to make everyone else stop seeing it. That's what gives the world its varieties. What someone might think is weird, somebody else might think is normal. When that happens, why is it okay to take away what makes that person feel normal? Just to make the other person feel better?     I walked into the store once before wanting to buy a videogame. I found one I thought looked cool, took it off the shelf, and brought it up to the cashier. He took one look at the game, saw the rating for it, and said that I had to have an adult with me to purchase the game. I went on about how my dad would not care if I bought this game. The cashier said it didn't matter and that I still had to have him here. Then I had to search throughout the store looking for my dad so that he could walk back to the cashier to buy the game for me. What difference did it make? In the end I got the game anyway.      That experience I had at the store that day let me know how it felt to have my wanting of something be shot down. It made me feel like a baby that needed permission to do something. It also helps me know how the writers, artists, and movie directors feel when they get their work censored, rejected, or banned because somebody somewhere found it offensive.      We need to let people express how they feel. If we didn't then a lot of the stuff today would be different. @PERSON1 had the idea of the world not being flat and that he could sail all the way around the world without falling off of it. Everybody thought he was crazy and got angry at his thinking. But he did it, and proved himself right.      Galilaue @CAPS5 thought came up with the theory that the sun did not revolve around the @LOCATION2. He started doing experiments and tried to prove his theory. The people of where he did his work got engraged and through him into exile and imprisoned him. After that somebody thought that it was a good idea, he experimented on it, and the people supported him. Now we have that theory as a fact, that the sun doesn't revolve around the @LOCATION2.      That is what makes freedom of speech so important to the world. It makes people think in different ways. It helps people think of new ideas. Freedom is the key to any way of living."	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
3934	2	"'@CAPS1 Books, Movies, Music, and Magazines?'          @CAPS2 do people take @CAPS1 books? Some people believe books, movies, music, and magazines should be sensored or 'band'. Why do people believe this should happen? Well there will be three topics that will be talked about in this eassy. The three topics are children, @CAPS4, and religion.          First, '@CAPS3'. Many parents themselves don't want there child to be exposed to viloence, volgure language, or even possible drugs. Viloence is one of the main problems to do with all four of these types of entertainment. Influencing there child could cause a loss by doing things as far known as stupidty. Another is volgure language, to adults for a generation above us, they take it as being disrespectful. News wide to this very day deals with drugs and teens getting more into them, causing an overdose that could lead to death.          Second, '@CAPS4'. Many people going from black to whites to eveyone around the world with different colored skin or more different type of features as one another. Here starts racsism, meaning against ones color or there ethics. Now to this day it has been calmed down but there was a time that certain words labeled certian people showing that they were less than others. Leading this to riots and gang viloents to earning respect. They want to be treated as an equal not less than others that which our ancentors did them in the past.          Third, '@CAPS5'. Religion is pretty big in the world and shows alot about the past and what certain people believe in. Religion is shown in these four types of form in these objects. Everyone believes theres is the right way and someone elses is the wrong. They cause conflicts in between one an another. So trying to keep them from bein banned isn't going to help for religion matters, because people do talk and some people out there want to change certain people to believe what they think is right.          So back to @CAPS2 would everyone or some take to @CAPS1 books, movies, music, magazines? Well it's going to be exposed sooner or later. Options are let it happen now or let it happen later. The sooner could be better or for the worst. Either matters just let happen what happens, someone will learn from there experience so why banned now?"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
3936	2	"I think that they shounldn't remove the censorship books in the libraries because so bigger kids can read the books not the little kids because they don't need to here the kind of words in the books.  Also the little  kids has to small of ear to hear and also to small of eyes to even see the words in the book like that.  The bigger kids like in grades @NUM1  should be able to look at the books because it will be word that have heard before.          The books shouldn't be in the lower grade libraries becaues the little kids will ckeack the books out of the libraries, like the books thatis called @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because it says the n word a lot of times, a other one is @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 becaues says a lot of dirt words like the f, s, and ect.words that they don't need to hear that young of age.       Another reason why it wounld not be fair to the bigger kids if they take away from the libraries becaues they tring to get the out of the libraries so the littler kids don't get the books to take home read at home.  If you are going to take away the books tale them away from the grades @NUM2 becaues the that the book called @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 And @CAPS5 will be bad for those kids to read.     Some more reasons why bigger kids should read the books and why not the little kids shouldn't read the books.  Why should the bigger kids in grade @NUM1 should read them becaues they are bigger then the littler kids are. The littler kids shouldn't becaues we don't want the littler kids to go home and say the words to there mom, dad, grandme, grandpa, and ect.       Now I have come to the end of my persuasive essay for the newpaper about my reflecting on why or why not we should get reid of the consorship in the libraraies.  Also until the next time I right again about this topic and I hopest you like this persuasive essay for the newpaper."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
3941	2	"Most people do not think that kids should see certain things if they are found offensive. Like some books, music, movies, and magazines. I do not believe books or any other thing should be removed from libraries shelf.           It should be the parent choice to what their child can look at or listen to. But now days when a child parent or any other authority don't let them do, watch, or listen to something it make  kids want it more. Since they want it more they will find away to do, watch, or listen to what ever it @MONTH1 be. They will even go behind there parents back and probably won't care if they get in trouble.           With this new generation authority can only limit so much of what children see today. Children see a lot of things that they are interested in and can find it all different types of ways. Computers, televsion, and the radio are three differnt major ways of finding things that maybe offensive but kids are interested in all the time. Young parents i do believe is one of the reasons kids know about these movies, books, music, and magazines. They say things and do things that young people should not know at a young age. That what make kids think its alright when their parents do what ever it maybe. So let it be the parent choice of what there child can see. Cause either way they going to be able to find away to get it."	2	3		2	2	3	2																		
3949	2	"The views on censorship in libraries definitely varies from person to person. There are those who are offended by the material that is out there for anyone to access, and then there are those who want the right to read, listen, and watch whatever they choose. I believe there are pros and cons to each choice, either way you look at it, but there does need to be some sort of censorship in libraries; the line must be drawn somewhere.     The lyrics in music can come off extremely offensive to some people. The inappropriate scenes in movies, whether it be involving two people of opposite sex or intense action moments, are not something people of a young age should be exposed to.     The easy access to the library is part of the problem. Someone of any age can get their hands on just about anything they want. In my own experience, I have had the opportunity to get whatever I wanted at the library. The advertising pictures on the cover of books, movies, magazines, etc., gave me a false sense of what the material really contained when I was younger. I came home from a day at the library with materials that my parents did not approve of.     If you look at it from the other point of view, you would probably be thinking, if we got rid of all material that someone would find offensive, our libraries would be left with close to nothing. In reality, I believe that once people realized that exposure to this kind of material is offensive, authors would change the way they would write; directors would change the way they produced movies; artists would change the lyrics to their songs. So yes, library's shelves would have been rid of many materials, but they would be replaced with what the people want.     Others might argue that they have the right to read, listen, and watch what they would like. This @MONTH1 be true, but shouldn't others have the right to let their children go to libraries without worrying about the gruesome material they might be exposed to?     Although to some people this argument @MONTH1 go either way, if the line is never drawn on what is available, who knows what the world @MONTH1 come to. From here, the material can only get more offensive, more disturbing, and leave a bigger effect on the minds of people. Children will be exposed to the 'evils' of this world at even a younger age, and if that is all they ever know, they won't realize what else this world has to offer them. Authors, directors, producers, and artists will all change their material if we show them that it is not what we want."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3956	2	"Censorship can be a very good thing. It keeps inapropriate material from falling into the wrong hands. It also keeps the horrors that are in the sensored material out of the community and that makes the community a better environment to live in. But too much censorship can become a bad thing. For instance @ORGANIZATION1 had an extreme censorship policy when he was burning all of those books. There also several books that talk about the censorship idea getting out of hand like the book @CAPS1 @NUM1. Libraries should censor some of there material.      Books and magazines need to be censored according to there content. Books and magazines both use words and sometimes pictures to get there point across. If a book is using vulgar and inapropiate language in should be in some way censored. With this in mind I should not be able to pick a book and open it to find sexual dialog. I also shouldn't be able to find the constant use of swear words in a book or magazine. Also lots of people get offended with violence and lots of gore. Magazines and books also use pictures to help get there point across. If there are inapropriate pictures in either of the two sources that material should be censored. If I am walking through my local library and just see a magazine sitting ou with a nude picture on the front I'm going to wonder about my library's censorship policy. Another example would be that I pick up a book and start looking through it and it has an inapropiate picture in it, I am going to wonder about my library's censorship policy. Also if a magazine has an extremly violent picture or extremely gorey picture it should be cnesored. Overall if a book or magazine is extremely inapropriate, then it should be, in some way, censored.     Music is another form of media that can be found at a library that should be censored. Musicians use artwork on the album sleeves to grab the attention of people. If that artwork includes swear words or inapropriate pictures it should be in some way or shape be censored. Musicians also play music of course. But if the lyrics to there songs are explicit or has many sexual themes it has to be conesored. Someone should have to deal with wading through music like that. No matter what, if an album of music is out of this world inaproiate, it should be censored.     Movies are most likely the hardest things to sensor. This is because they use language, pictures, music, and video. Movies are multi-media monsters that can sometimes be very clean, and sometimes be very inapropriate. If a movie is rated @CAPS2 it should not be in a public library. Movies that are rated @CAPS3 for seual content, nudity, drug use, alcohol abuse, or swearing should be censored. A kid should not be able to get his hands on that kind of stuff in a public library. Also depending on how violent and a gorey a movie is it should be cenesored. Movies that are inapropiate, especially ones rated @CAPS3, should be censored.     The fact that this debate even needs to happen is sad. But it does so we must censor certain things that people @MONTH1 get a offended by if they saw it in there public library. Things containing nudity, sexual content, swear words, gore, and violence to possibaly be censored. There also needs to be a line where we stop sensoring or pretty soon, just like Katherine Paterson said we won't have any books left. But overall there needs to be some type of censorship in public libraries."	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
3958	2	"Do I believe that our libraries have some books on their shelves that they shouldnt have. Well of course I think that there are some books, music, movies, magazies, that young children should not read about, hear, or watch. These kind of things affect our every day living.      Lets start off with a book that has killing in it. I'm not a parent at the time, but I know for a fact that I would not wan't my children reading about that kind of violence. Thats not something that a twelve year old child should be reading about. Those kind of books could get kids thinking oh he killed someone why couldn't I, and thats how some kids grow up to be bad and have to go to jail at the age of @NUM1, because they have killed someone or tried at least. There also other books that some children shouldn't read about and that @MONTH1 be about slavery. If a mother doesn't want their child to know about slavery at the age their at there shouldn't be that type of book on the shelves for a ten year old to read about. I mean if I had family members that lived in the slavery days i for sure wouldn't wan't my kids to read about it, because that shows how white people disrespected the blacks and that could have an affect on that child. That could cause them not to like white people.     Second is the music. I know that most libraries don't have all that bad music that is on the radios, but I'm sure there is some music that has something about steeling on it. Thats aother thing that could give kids the wrong idea and send them on the wrong track again. There's just some things children shouldn't hear unless their with one of their parents, and then that parent could explain to them that you shouldn't do what the song says. But they shouldn't be in our school or public libraries.     The third thing is movies. There should not be any movies of killing, breaking in peoples houses or fighting at any sircumstance in a school library. School is not a place for a child to be watching those kind of things. That just gives a young child the wrong kind of idea, and isn't approperiate for schools to have.     The last one is magazines. There should notbe magazines at school of women in their bathing suits or men with out shirts on. That could make the kid think he could do that and he could get him self in to big trouble.     Thats what I think about the books, music, magazines, and movies in a library."	3	3		3	3	3	3

I have alot experience with this because I read alot of car magazines and they sometimes have alot models in them, but I'm your avage seventeen year old and I'm ok with this also, but there is a lamt.     My school is very good about this they see one flag it and put it in the back , but they still let you read it. I like this because it keeps the bad apples off the self. I have a very good kinship with my mom and dad they do tell me I can get, but if it's nineiy-five perent cars and only five perent models they are ok with that.     I said a thing about limt.

3967	2	"What is offensive? How do we know what offends people, I mean everyone is different, everyone has their own thoughts a beliefs. So how are we suppose to know what offends who?     The things that I would find offensive would be racial discrimination, gender discrimination, or religious discrimination. Those types of things would offend most people I think, but you can never be to sure.     Books will always be books though and you can not tell people what they can and can not write or publish, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech. People will always say what they want but not everyone can get what they want. People need to come to sence and understand that consept.     If a book, magazine, song, movie, or any other type of writen or vocal recording offends some one then do not read, listen to, or watch that item. No one can make some one watch or listen to something that offends them. People will always have a choice to do what they want in most cases.     Books, songs, movies, magazines, and many other things will always offend atleast one person in the world we live in, but to be honest do we really care if it offends people if that is how we feel or believe? So I believe that if it offends a person then they will not take it off the shelf and if they do then that is their own personal problem people can not tell others what they can or can not write or record, it is their life let them live it."	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
3976	2	"Censorship?     Have you ever been looking for a book and not being able to find it? Have you ever gone to a library and the magazine you were looking for was behind everything else on the top shelf? Well if you have, you have experienced censorship. Censorship is where things are sheltered from the the light of day. A specific place of censorship is with books and magazines at libraries.     Most people today are worried about offensive things on and in books or magazines. A big question I ask is why? Well I can tell you why. Most people of today are too afraid of what other people think. Everything and everyone has to be perfect. I strongly disagree with this because if someone writes a book, they should not be afraid to put something in it because of what other people have to think about it. If they do not like it, then do not read it.     I do not think that things should be sheltered from libraries because sometimes it can get a point across to some people. If there is a article up on a shelf and it has an appealing image on it, you are going to stop and read it . If it has a good message to send to you will think about it. Then once you have thought about it, you will make your own opinion on what that article said. If you have a positive opinion you might go pick that magazine up and read it. If you have a negative opinion on what it said then you will not even look at the next time you go by there.     If you think that something is too bad for eyes of other people then so be it. That is your opinion and you have all of the right to it. I will not dislike you for your opinion and I will not look at you any differently. The only thing I hope is that I got my point across to you."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3994	2	"There are many opinions on censorship in libraries. Some people believe that if books are offensive in any way that they should be removed, while other believe that these books should stay since there are different opinions on what is classified as 'offensive'. I believe that books should remain on shelves due to the fact that all people view things differently and its free will that allows people to pick up these books. No one if forcing them to read them.      I believe when books, music, movies, and magazines publish offensive material that it is just a matter of opinion. I feel that people have different perspectives on what they find appropriate. For example, a magazine article containing information about the wrong doings of the political offices or a cartoon of a certain candidate. Some poliliticians might find this article offensive and take it as a jab towards them while others see it just as an opinion on the matter. Another example would be a book on religious purposes. For instance, a book on an @CAPS1 religion. Some @CAPS2 might take it as offensive if the informations paints them as being a certatin stereotype, but others @MONTH1 see it as educational learning.      I also feel like this somewhat goes along with the idea of free will. No one can force a person to not read a certain book or listen to a certain song. It's free will that allows us to read, listen, and watch whatever pleases us. I feel that if someone was to go and demand that we take a book off a shelf that takes away from a person's free will who @MONTH1 be coming to rent the book that day. Its up to an individual to decide on what they will read and what their take is on the matter.      I also feel that these types of media should remain on the shelves because of learning and educational purposes. I believe that even though some of these books or movies might have a couple of offensive lines or phrases that does not mean the whole thing is offensive. I think that the library is a place where people can go and research information. Some of the material found @MONTH1 be offensive to a certain person but that does not cancel out the rest of the book and mark it as being 'wrong'. I think that we must decide on what we believe is right in books and tune out what we feel is offensive or else many informational books would not be available today.      The library is a place where our free will comes into play. I feel that the offensiveness in books, music, movies, and magazines are all based on personal opinions and that they should never be removed from libraries. These books all contain information that could be veiwed in different ways and that it is up to the public to decifer for themselves what is offensive and what is acceptable. I believe that no one should decide for us"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
3996	2	"Empty @CAPS1     @CAPS2 is it wrong to censor? In the world there are today there is about @NUM1 billion people. All these people make up diffrent groups with diffrent moral codes, ethics, beliefs, and out looks on the world. With this in mind, there comes a problem with what is wrong and right. The three subject that will be discused in this article will be censorship, expression, and society.     To be censored puts a lable on things that says this article is not fit to be seen, or heard by anyone. Censorship was made to protect people from raw material that is seen as unfit or cruel. Music is censored for the subject or matter it speaks about, wether it would be of sex, drugs, or poltics. This goes for movies, magazines, newspapers, televison, or other forms of media. the reasons that somethig is censored changes from place to place.     Expression of ones inner thoughts of the world or a genral area could be desaterous in the eyes of some. To others, expression gives the chance to see who could be the next @CAPS3 vinci, @PERSON1, or anyother great thinker of the world. Censoring these people can and would be horrible. The idea that just beacuase someone has a diffrent out look does not mean they are the evil that is in the world. True their work could cause a problem, but their idea should not be shuned by the world. The material they produce should be aloud to be seen by anyone of any age.     Society possess a big problem. Society or how one should act in public is diffrent all over the world. So therfore what is censored here would not be censored somewhere else. This also mean what is wrong or right is diffrent to everyone on earth. The society will have great effect on with is aloud to be seen or heard by those that live in the society. if the society disagrees with the ideas of something the society will have it banned. If this is let to continue nothing will be aloud to speak its mind on anything.     So @CAPS2 is censorship wrong? Censorship is unjust to those with ideas unlike others. If someone can censor someone else then that person that is being censored could in turn censor the person that is censoring them because of that persons veiws. So yes it is wrong to censor anything or anyone for thier ideas, morals, ethics, rules, laws, beliefs, or conduct. Everything should be aloud to exsist and be seen or heard by anyone who wants to look into that subject of matter. In conclusion censorship, expression, and society will always have veiws but none of these view should ever be hiddin from anything or anyone."	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
3999	2	"As far as opinions go, everyone has one. Only in certain situations are people's opinions actually taken seriously. When it comes to a debate on serious situations such as 'censorship', there will be an arguement for those who agree and for those who disagree. Agreeing to a cause such as 'inappropriate book removal' in ones opinion shouuld not be omitted..     At the ages of children, teens, and young adults, their minds are very curious. If interested in something they will go out and seek information for it if the adult does not provide proper information to what is asked. Books, magazines, newspapers, novels, etc are public reading materials that are meant for everyone to see. Hiding it would be like robbing them of their right to be informed.      Not all reading materials are dangerous to the mind and eyes of the youth. The issue is how the parents raised them to embrace knowledge that they see. A maturity level must be high enough for that child to be able to understand what it is they're looking at. It would  be useless for the adult to hide things from them until the age of @NUM1, when they are legally obligated to consume any sort of knowledge. The easiest way would be for the adult and child to have a sit-and-chat session for better understanding.     Removing novels and books from libraries publicly or even at school would do nothing more than just raise the childs curiousity level to the highest extent. This, some would believe, would persuade the child to go out and experience it first hand so that they know what it is, and later in life know what to expect. Doing so would, could, and @MONTH1 be harmful and dangerous depending on the act made by the child. When the simplist solution would just be approving that child to read and be educated.     Therefore if one person out of millions dislike a book becuase they feel it can greatly influence one child to do the wrong thing, then another child who try and keep their self away from it can't be taught because someone had a deep abhor for it and decided that it was outlandishly inappropriate for someone, much as a child, to read.          To agree to removing information form the library is absoulutely purposeless, and @MONTH1 be an inconvenience for someone whom @MONTH1 have been determined to research something. With all honesty, books and novels were made for a reason. That reaason is to entertain, inform, and educate. By  removing every source all those who agree to the cause should also agree to the fact that they have no remorse for the outcome of how their child grows up and become someone they never wanted them to be."	4	3		4	3	3	3

If people want to read something that is to bad I say let thim what is so rong with reading everyone needs to read maybe thats the only books some people like to read. So by taking thim books off isn't helpping anything. I think some of the bad books taken off the shelves are good just have bad things in thim, any book is a good book. If something is so bad it needs off the shelves there has to be a reason for it, the way I see it is that there as to be a really good part in that book that just loves to make people mad and you know what that is funny. People get mad at books that they dont want there kids to read, or there mad because that didnt come up with that idea. If you dont want ur kids to read it tell thim not to let the older people that dont care have a good time reading. Most people like to read about mested up things.           Music and Movies are a different story. Bad movies shouldent be put out for everyone to see movies arnt the same as books because a kid could get a bad book and not now have of the bad stuff means. But movies show you how bad things are shown. Music can also teach you how to do bad things by doing the same thing they did to make thim look cool. But I still think you should be able to have what you want to pick and if you have kids you are a boss to thim you can tell thim not to get anything bad"	2	3		2	3	3	3																		
4002	2	"Libraries should or should not have books, music, magazines that are found offensive? Some people like things that are different than what you or anyone else like you @MONTH1 think some of the things are offensive, but yet again something you don't like someone else @MONTH1 like, and want to read. Would if be fare to you that you like something, and want to read it, but someone else dose not like, and thinks that it offens them, and they should take it off a shelf at a public library because of what that person said.      I don't think that thinks like that should be taken off a shelf for something like, becasue there could be a person in school that needs soemthing like that is not right for a child to be looking at,but what if there is a kid in high school or collage that needs a book to do a project over that type of things, but also yes I do think that things that little kids should not be looking at or listening or reading something like should not be able to get a hold of because parents should not have to worry about them going to a librariy, and there children see something that they do not want them to see. There are vary many ways that people that work in the libraries can keep things up from children that is to little to see or hear what there parents do not want them too. Some ways that you can do that is by putting all the books and music that is like that in a section of the library that you have to be a sertent age to be able to go look or listen to them.      Lubraries are for everyone no matter what you look like or dress. You as a person has the right to go in to a public library and look for something to read no matter if it has some curse words or some violence in the reading. If you are reading those kinds or books you should be machure for your age and not have to worry about it. You hear and see everything that you read about today so I don't see the difference in if a child hears or sees it beacuse you see it just about every where you go now days. You really can not get away with out dealing with it"	3	4		3	2	2	2																		
4011	2	"Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 the world there are people who censor what their people read and write, these works are oftenly produced by communist and socialist governments. Here in @LOCATION1 we have the right to say,read, and write what we want,about anybody or anything. Censoship does exist in the @LOCATION1, and it is in the form of opoion that it exists.     I have read artricles in the paper about how text books have covered up the truth,due to what is politicaly correct. I have heard of libaries taking down books that have a very strong political opoion, often these are books written by conservitives.I have read about books coming out with the only intention of slamming,proabable presidential nomanees. Being a conservitive myself,I do not believe that these books should not be in book stores,libaries, or other public venues.     I believe this because in @LOCATION1 we have freedom of press and,for these books not to reach the public is against that right and,the free-flow of ideas.You @MONTH1 ask way I believe this? I believe this because I too want others to hear and read about my ideas, on how to obtain life,liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.      Now that @PERSON1, is why all books should be in our libaries.I agree with a restricted section where certain books should be stored,so little children will not get a hold of @NUM1 I would like this paper to put an article out about these thoughts. We the @ORGANIZATION1 are a republic,and we for over @NUM2 years have encouraged the free-flow of ideas.Why stop now?thank you @PERSON2"	3	3		3	2	3	2																		
4018	2	"Conflicting works of art such as books, music, and movies, have always been seen in libraries. Whether it's @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1, someone is going to be offended. But whether or not these offending works should be banned is a common topic among authors, musicians, and movie-goers alike. I personally believe that all of these works have a right to be seen, heard, or read, because the creator has put much effort into stating their opinion and have a right to freedom of the press.         You could take any famous work and someone could be offended @CAPS5 it because it displays something contrary to their beliefs. But this does not mean that that work should be banned! Banning a book would mean total rejection to the author's thoughts and opinions, and everyone has a right to those. The censorship of any work is unconstitutional because as citizens of the @LOCATION1 we have total freedom of the press. You simply can't apply censorship because whether you keep it on the shelves or not, people are going to be offended. Also, as shown in @PERSON1's @CAPS4 @NUM2, the censorship of books could lead to a society unable to have a real knowledge of the past and the feelings and thoughts of the people of that age.      To me, 'offensive' books, movies, and music are not bad, they are merely a stimulant for debate. They can allow you, rather than just the author, to express your feelings on what was presented in the works. But to completely remove the cometition of the debate would be sabotage. @PERSON2 @LOCATION1 that 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else.' @CAPS5 saying this she is expressing that if we all could go into a library and remove the books, magazines, movies, or music that we do not like, then there would be absolutely nothing left. Every work would be remove because at least one person is offended @CAPS5 every work of the sort. Therefore, to allow books to be read, music listened to, and movies watched is to allow everyone the freedom of writing down their thoughts or stances.      The censorship of any work, anywhere, is allowing for the 'shutting up' of ideas. These ideas are the ones that keep society going @CAPS5 making us think and helping to formulate our opinions. @CAPS5 allowing this we are creating future generations of great thinkers. In this case, @CAPS5 keeping books, magazines, and music on the shelves, we can continue to 'learn from the past' and utilize the information and ideas that have been used throughout history"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4020	2	"I can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the book shelf. I hope our children or any other children take this book off the shelf because it would be offensive or demeaning to the race of me or the children. This book would probably make the children asks question that we don't really want to talk about.           This book would probably be a book I wouldn't recommend for my children to read or even look at the pages or cover of the book. I mean if it wasn' t demeaning to anybody's race or skin color I would let my children read it, but if it had like profanity and racial slurs in it I would tell my kids that this book is off limits until you are older.          Certain magazines such as like swimsuit models and other inappropriate stuff my children shouldn't be aloud to look at. Music is like the magazines if it has like profanity and talks about drugs then I'm not going to let my kids listen to it. Movies are just like magazines and music, if it has inappropriate stuff in it then my kids don't need to watch or listen to it. My exception for a movie is if it is rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, then they are aloud to watch it but if it is rated @NUM1 or @CAPS3 then my kids can forget about watching it.      So in the end, yes I can think of a book, movie, or magazine that I don't want my children or any children to get their hands on cause you never know what that could lead to. And if your a strict parent like I plan on being don't let your kids watch, look at, or listen to inappropriate stuff because that is just putting bad stuff in their brain.      I have to admit I have watched, listened to, and looked at some bad stuff but I regret it all so very much so. There are so many inappropriate books, movies, magazines out there in today's libraries, it's bad because little kids can get a hold of this stuff and take it home without their parents noticing that they took this bad stuff home"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4032	2	"I think people read more books that are banned from schools and libraries, they listen to 'rebel' music, or they just watch controvesial movies, so is censoring really effective? I do not think censoring  is really necessary. If you think a subject might be offensive for you, you should not read it. instead of censoring the products in a library we should censor the readers, I believe people are mature enough to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen. Media is just another way to gain knowledge that's why they are used at school.       I would like to go to my school library and find books like, 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2', I know this book is considered as one of @LOCATION1's most famous literature work, but it was once banned from some schools around the nation. The reason of the banning was that they believed that the book contained pornography, and it wasn't school appropiate. My english teacher used this method, by telling us this, to encourage us to read it. My classmates who hadn't read the book wanted to find the pornography in it, if you were to ask me... I did not find it. Another literary work which was banned once is 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', this book was banned because @PERSON1, a black character in the book, was called a @CAPS4,and thought to be stupid sometimes during the book. Even though @PERSON1 is the most noble and innocent character in the book, some people found this offensive and not appropiate. Movies with strong language are rated for it's public so I don't think this should be a problem. Music in the other hand, depends on the singer's music style and that should be monitored by parents.     I trully believe that we should not censor any material in libraries, but if it's necessary, they could stablish an age limit to check-out any controversial material. As I said before, media is just another way to gain knowledge"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4033	2	"As @CAPS1, we are entitled to both freedom of speech and freedom of the press.  However, these rights are somewhat suppressed in the censorship of media at libraries.     I can understand why libraries feel that they need to ban certain works; there are many children that frequent libraries, and having explicit content could deter parents from allowing them to visit.  Surely, though, the media in question could be placed in a seperate area, off-limits to anyone under a certain age.  Even if someone gets their hands on one of these works, safeguards could be used at the front desk to keep them from borrowing the material.  Their library card would show their age, and the worker would not allow them to check out the work if they were too young.     Furthermore, I trust in people's common sense.  If they believe that a book or movie will be too adult for them, they will avoid checking it out of the library.  Parents, as well, will surely not allow their children to borrow risque material.  Information is open to those that search for it, and the knowledge it brings prevents unwanted results.     There are those that want this content banned because it does not conform to their morals, but this is really just setting restrictions on other's freedoms.  They @MONTH1 think it is too explicit, but another @MONTH1 not.  That other person might want to use the material, but because of restrictions set by the first person, the borrowing of the work becomes prohibited.  It seems that if the first doesn't agree with the material, they could just let it be, and not bring others into the dispute.  People know their limits and generally make sure they don't cross them.     I think this conflict represents the @CAPS2 way of life in itself.  When a disagreement arises, no matter what the topic, one group of people wants to basically control what everyone else can or cannot do.  They organize protests, sign petitions, etc. True, people do protest laws, and with good reason.  However, there really is no need to argue over petty issues that could easily be avoided if people were to just use common sense to reach a consensus.  I think this censorship issue is a prime example of that.     When it comes to these kinds of debates, we need to learn that we can't be too quick to place restrictions; that we should leave others to do what they think is best for themselves.  The best course of action is to leave others alone concerning simple things such as this, and to avoid placing any restrictions on anyone's works, rights, and freedom.  To paraphrase @ORGANIZATION1, I @MONTH1 not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death your right to say it."	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
4040	2	"Books have been around for hundreds and hundreds of years. They have significent value in culture, lives, and everything else. We all see kids laughing and enjoying books about pretty ponies and little puppies. What we don't see is how books and magazines are really effecting people of different race, religion, or age. We should take a stand and get rid of these bad books. Negitive books, movies, and magazines should be taken off the shelf to prevent hurt feelings and ideas.      We have learned to accept everybody no matter what color they are. I remember in @NUM1 grade when a girl named @PERSON1 got very upset because she thought a book was making fun of her skin color. Everyone in the book was white and excluded a african american girl from playing with them because she wasn't pretty enough. She went to tell the teacher and the teacher threw the book away and said that we should all learn to treat everyone with respect no matter what they look like. We need to have more books like what the teacher was trying to teach us. To boost everyones spirits and make them feel better about themselves. The world has changed and books should too.      Many things influence people of different ages, race, or religion. Books that talk bad about other religions or make you second guess your faith are considered negitive and should be taken off the shelf. How would you like it if someone was putting down your religion? That is how many people feel when reading that kind of material. These books, magazines, and movies are not good for anybody and should not be anywhere near libraries.      Have you been watching what your kids are reading about or what movies they are watching? Most of childrens books and movies have pretty princesses and little mermaids but not all of them. Behind some movies or books there is are violence and bad scenes. When fight scenes occur and zombies attack, children believe that everything is real and that it is ok to kill someone if they are a bad. Boys believe that it is ok to hurt people because that is what happens in the movies. Girls believe that everything about a princess is perfect and flawless and to be a princess they also have to be flawless. Do we really want childrent to think it is ok to fight and be upset because they are not perfect? Libraries need to get rid of these book and movies because it is badly influencing the children in the world.      Not all books are bad and not all of them are good, so we need to divide and conquer. We need to take a closer look and really examine what needs to be taken off the shelves. The books, magazines, and movies that influence people to think differently about themselves need to go away for good. To get rid of these books that cause conflict within a person is like getting rid of a big burden. It can make a really big improvment in adults and children. Please take negitive books and movies off the shelves to prevent any unnecessary problems!"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4041	2	"Books @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3      @CAPS4 your in a library its many book that children decide to read that @MONTH1 not be suited for their @CAPS3. Many parents allow their kids to read those type of books so they're use to it now. But some book aren't for children @CAPS3.     Now and days kids are more mature and knowledgeable and can read on higher levels. @CAPS4 kids go to the library they look for book that catch their attention. Some books that are out shouldn't be out and thats my opinion. Most authors write about things such as sex, drugs, and other bad thing. @CAPS4 a child looks at things like that they get ideas about what the book is talking about and try those things they read. Im not saying that all kids read books and decide to try all the things that they read, but most will.     Some kids minmic off certain things they hear, see and even read. Kids are always going to look up to other people so what they see you do they will try to do it. I beleive that things like books that kids should'nt read should be put away. Books should be taken off the shelves and put in places where only adults could get them. Just like video games only a certain age group could play the game because of the things they do in the game. The things kids see they soon try out. They should also make it where you rate a book like you rate movies, video games and other things. All books aren't bad for children @CAPS3 but some are.      I notice that many parents don't care about what their kids read as long as they're reading. People should'nt think that way  because its alot of crule people in this world. I even seen on the news where it was an author who wrote a book about how he killed a lady. So many teens read that book and found it interesting. And it even gave young boys ideas about killing people or girl friends. That book should be in the hands of someone with a mature mind that really knows right from wrong. Its parents out in this world that wouldn't allow their kids to read books that have bad things in them. Most parents find it offensive that book stores or other places sell these type of books to their children. The things authors talk about in their books and what they include no @CAPS5 should read.     Books that aren't good for certain age groups or that have inaproprate things in it should be removed from the shelves. But certain people interpret the words different and veiw it different. Its many books out in this world that most parents or grandparents hope their kids or grandkids never take off the shelf.

4042	2	"The material we read in books are sometimes offensive. Books that are offensive should be supervised as to who gets to view them. I believe that every parent has the right to oversee what there child reads. I also believe that Censorship is a good thing sometimes     The material we find in books is not as much of a proplem to our youth as any other thing. The reasoning for me saying this is that youth to day are not really woried about picking up a book and reading is as much as them picking up a magazine, cellular phone, iPod or using a computer. I believe magazines are worse than any book. Books are reed mostly for knowledge wereas magazines are mostly reed for people to catch up on the latest trends. Magazines can lead to people listing to the next hotest band, singer or rapper, whatever.          Music that you hear on the radio is filled with suggestive lyrics. Then people get pulled in. Music doesn't have rating were movies do. Movies are a little easier to control because of there ratings but children are alway going to get there hands on it no matter what.      This is were the internet comes into play. Most people have acsess to a computer. Children could be on the internet for hours looking up things that aren't ment for them to see. Internet is also use to educate.      The internet also opens up the doors to video games. Children can play with there friends all around the world now without leaving there bedroom. They also play with complete stranger. Some of the other player could be a bad influence to them because they were influenced by music, magazines, music, ect.., that send a bad message.           No one is ever going to be able to control what our youth see. The only way is to close our libraries and shut down the internet. Even if we do this there could always still be away."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4047	2	"As the Katherine Paterson's quote states everyone in fact has the right to take books, movies, magazines and other items off the shelves if deemed offensive or inappropriate. However this should be their decision and only their's; not other parents rallying together to get their desired results; the removal of certain books.      In todays times so much is viewed as offensive or inappropriate that wasn't when the previous generations read them. When parents read these things today they feel these items are inappropriate versus when they were teenagers they felt it was appropriate. Of course in todays technological age kids can lay their hands on just about anything if they know how to.      So, if parents begin censoring items there is one incentive or reason for them to read or listen to it; and disobey parents. They also get receive an unconventional or unintended education. So if parents censor the kids have been given a multitude of reasons to go against their parents wishes and read or listen to it anyway. So that is why parents shouldn't censor what their kids read, listen to, or see because eventually they will see it. Do you want that?"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4054	2	"The @CAPS1,     I read an intresting @CAPS2 the other day by Katherine Paterson an author. The @CAPS2 said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- the work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'      I believe that people should not have the right to take matieral such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. of the shelf of a library, or anywhere else those items are displayed. So I agree %@NUM1 with Paterson because people have their own opions. Some stuff @MONTH1 be more offensive than others to different people. I have observed people, and were all different so why should our thoughts be to? The answer is yes they should be different. But it is pretty simple if you find a book, song, movie, or magazine that you find offensive or distasteful then put it back another person might find it intresting.      I want to know the thoughts of my fellow citizens about what Paterson has said. I am asking for your help to do so. I would like you to put the @CAPS2 in The @CAPS1 and hear what people have to say about it.

4069	2	"Have you ever went to a library and found that some books arn't really the best choice for younger kids to be reading? Well I am about to write a persuasive essay explaining what I think is best for younger children to be reading.          I have went to multiple libraries and found that some books, magazines, and movies are way to extreme for kids to be reading/watching. I personaly think that children who arn't above @CAPS5 years old shouldn't be exposed of rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @NUM1 books, movies, or magazines. Children shouldn't have to know what adult movies, books, or magazines should look like at the age @NUM2. What I think kids should watch or read are @CAPS2 movies and books.           Some of you are probly like 'but it's not like there going to know what it means.' @CAPS4 if children don't know what something means then that deffinantly won't stop them from saying it. Children learn by hands on or watching other things. They will eventually ask what does this mean or mommy what does this word mean. No parent is ready to tell there child at the age of three what a four letter word means. If you are one of the few parents that don't know how to explain things to your child then thats when you can bring out the older books/movies. But don't let them read it on there own. Usually kids will start asking about more adult things when the hit the age @CAPS5 and up. Thats when you as a parents can start letting them read and watch older movies and books.          Tweleve years old is still a pretty young age for a kid to be reading and watching older movies on there own. Thats when you as a parent can sit down next to them and explain what is going on. As a kid we look up to our parents. We learn from seeing what you guys do. That is the exact same thing as reading and watching movies that are way to extreme for us at the age of ten. At the age of sixteen then usually kids are fine on there own they know what to expect. They know what is happening and they know how to handel it.           In conclusion I think that rated @CAPS1 books, magazines and movies should be kept above ages one-@CAPS5. I think that kids will be better off learning about things that they need to know by the time middle school starts. Then once they hit highschool they will already know about what becoming an adult is all about"	4	3		4	3	3	3																		
4079	2	"There are many books, music, movies, and magezines in the world. Some are humorous, historic, or romantic, however some are offensive in some way. People @MONTH1 get offended when they read or listen to certain things, but does that mean that those things should be removed from the shelf? Some people @MONTH1 find something offensive while another person does not, therefore the music, books, movies, or magazines should not be removed from the shelves.     If a person thinks that a song should be removed from the shelf and it does get removed, what about the person who did not find it offensive? People are intitled to their own thoughts and feelings, however that doesn't mean that one person's feelings are better than someone else's. If everyone tried to make everyone happy then there wouldn't be a lot of options to chose from in the library. If one person finds something offensive in a book, another person might find another book that is offensive, and it goes on until there aren't any books left.      With entertainment it is hard to please everyone. No matter what it is there will always be at least one person who doesn't like it. This, however, does not mean that it should be removed from shelves. If one person does find it offensive then there is most likely someone else who doesn't. The people who don't find something offensive want to be satisfied, too. It is impossible to please everyone, so what should be done?     If someone finds something offensive, they shouldn't read or listen to it. People can chose to quit listening to a song, quit watching a movie, or quit reading a book or magazine that they @MONTH1 find offensive. They have the right and freedom to not pay any attention to it. This way the person who isn't offened can still enjoy their choices of entertainment at the library.      If I find something offensive I try not to pay attention to it. There are many books or songs that I do find offensive, so I just avoid those. By avoiding these books or songs I don't offend anyone else by taking away something that they might enjoy. I still am satisfied and so are they.     The library workers know what they are doing. If the library takes away a book because some people find it offensive then they might be offending those people who didn't find it offensive by basically saying that their morals are better than yours. A library should take a book or magazine out if it feels necessary, but not to please certain customers becuase then they aren't pleasing the other customers and could offend them.      People have the right to voice there feelings but that doesn't mean that they are always right and that certain things should be changed because of them. It is impossible to make everyone completely satsified but there are compromises. The libraries shouldn't remove things off their shelves but should give more options that won't be offensive, and people should avoid the things that they find offensive"	4	4		4	4	4	4

I am writting your newspaper company to tell you that I think the censorship should be implied more in libraries. Their should be something like a warning label on the magazines, movies, music, etc. that the parent has to sign before that says, '@CAPS1 child can see or hear the materials being displayed.'      In this centry we have @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 shows showing violience, sexual content, alcohol, and drugs. Its almost impossible to keep all children away from these things, but we should at least try to. There are shows on @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 now showing teenage pregnencys, and they are pursading the viewers that its okay to have children without being married, or even in a relationship with the person. @ORGANIZATION1 shows are now showing things like stealing in stores and the actor or actress getting away with the prize with no conserquence. Also they have violence and uneeded langauge.      I know from @CAPS1 own experience watching @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS1 dad has came into @CAPS1 room, and told me to turn it off. That they shouldn't be allowed to do somethings they are showing the viewers. I know when I am married and have children I will keep @CAPS1 kids away from certain materials as long as I can until they are old enough to understand, and know the right thing to do in the situation. Some of the language they use such as 'retard' I find offensive.      In @CAPS1 opition the censorship in libraries and in households have really declined. Some parents have no idea what their child might be watching behind closed doors. A good parent would make sure that the materials their child is watching is appropraite for there age.      Even books have sexual contact, and language. When I have children I will make sure that they are reading materials that fit them. Magazines these days are even worse. The call the @CAPS7 '@CAPS6 @CAPS7' for a reason, and young teens are picking it up off the shelves at conveniate stores and are reading it. Most music you hear on the radio has some sort of offensive words, refuring to sexual activity, or they are singing about drinking or drugs. Parents need to get more involved in their childrens life, and what they are reading or seeing. I am not saying that all materials need to be removed from the shelves, because some movies or reading materials send off great messages to kids and teens. I am just concerned about some things people can get so easily without any censoring.   I hope you read this essay and really take it into concerderation. I hope to hear back from you soon.

Censored material can have bad influences on children. Scary movies can make children have nightmares. There should be restrictions against offensive materials.     Libraries contain plenty of books, music, movies, and magazines for everyone. Libraries also have some offensive items in them. Offensive material should be removed from libraries. Children don't need to see inappropriate material in libraries. Inappropriate material can have bad influences on kids.     Censored material such as offensive language, smoking, and alchol are extremely bad influences on children. Children don't need to say cuss words. Smoking can lead to cancer or death. Alchol is also addicting and can cause a person to become violent. Children shouldn't be able to see these inappropriate items in libraries.     Scary movies can give children nightmares. When I was a child, I saw a scary movie and I couldn't even sleep that night. Inappropriate movies need to have ratings so that kids don't watch them. Kids believe most of what they watch in movies. Movies should be restricted from children to watch them.     There is a lot of material in libraries that should be censored from children. Bad influences can have a bad effect on children.

If you ask my opinion I would have to side with not removing certain books,movies,music,etc.     One of the many reasons why I believe we should not remove them is because everyone is entitled their own opinion.Some @MONTH1 find a book offensive,well on the other hand some @MONTH1 find it riviting and not offensive at all. If the person thinks the book is offensive they should simpily not read it.They should not have to band books,music,movies,etc. just because some find it offensive .Well others @MONTH1 find things offensive that the other person does not .We all have are own beliefes and we should be free to express them,as long as it doesnt involve breaking any laws.     Another reason why I agree with not removing certain books,movies,and so on is because we might not have any left.Like i said before we all have our own opinions.Not every single person is going to say a book,etc. doesnt offend them.We should not have to take away certain items.But on the other hand i believe we should restrict certain books,moves,music,etc. If a book,movie,etc.,seems to complicated for a child to comprehend,then they should not be able to read,watch,etc.,the item.We should classify things based on knowledge,understanding,and maturity.     Also I believe we all have a right to believe what we want to believe. Just as we all have choices.I can agree with some of the arguments other people have for removing certain books,and movies,etc.,but the main idea is to do what is best for everyone.I just dont see that removing every book,movie,music,etc.,will solve any problems .In fact I truly believe it would make matters worse.Their would be arguments of what to remove and what not to.

4099	2	"Libraries are community centers. Children and adults go to libraries to check out new books that could give them new experiences and information. If libraries took out books because they were inappropriate or offensive, then young adults and adults would never recieve those new experiences. Libraries require all sorts of books to make it a qualified library. If libraries censor their books, then other materials might start vanishing as well.       Most young adults read about books that are about adventure, mystery, or love. A person could find a mystery book with a serial killer for a main character offensive, but you can't rewrite the book for one person; futhermore, take that book completely off the shelf. That book is public property. If the library took that mystery book off the shelf, then the library is taking away the experience of another young adult reading it. One teenager's thoughts do not account for other teenagers' thoughts.      Libraries that take away offensive or inappropriate books might influence other multi-billion dollar industries to second guess their work. The movie industry, for example. The movie industry might second guess the directors or actors/actresses they are hiring. Actors and actresses have a large influence on many teenagers and children. Imagine if a child's favorite actor disappeared from future movies; that child would be left without a role model. The affects of censoring books and magazines go way beyond the libraries.      Music artist might also be affected. Rappers curse and swear in their music because it is how they voice their opinions and personal experiences. For example, @ORGANIZATION1, a famous rapper. He curses in his music because it's how he shows his emotion in an event. If music publishers wouldn't publish him because his work is offensive, then he would lose his job and career. This is how people in today's society make their living; by providing entertainment to other people.      Libraries have no right to take away any books from other children and adults. Authors know what they are writing. They write it because it shows emotions and feelings. It is the same thing with music artists and screen-play writers. If movies were all about unicorns the movie industry would fall apart quickly. Libraries, as a whole, need to think about the bigger picture before they extinguish books, experiences, thoughts, and hard work"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4100	2	"Raded @CAPS1 for @CAPS2, violance and some nudety. This kind of movie shouldnt be on any kind of shelf. Its to inapprope for kids, see or even read what the movie case says.     There shouldnt be any kind of movie or magazine with nude pictures. Its bad for the kids to see or here because one day a little boy/girl is going to do something that they see in a movie or a magazine and get in trouble. Its just wrong to see other people naked if u ask me. The only person i want to see that way is my wife in ten or so years. But i dont want to watch a movie and see a lady nude.       The nest thing is violance. Man i just wish guns wernt invented or bombs. Because I have lost alot of friends to guns. I lost about six cousins in the war from where a bomb hit there area. More and more people and going out and buying guns and bombs because, of movies and what people say in books and in magazines. People are getting name of guns and what they look like from movies and magazines and getting them and getting bombs off the black market. People get these ideas because of movies.      Last but not least @CAPS2 it the main thing kids get in trouble for in schools. They leard it from movies mainly because the actor say the words. Now the kids know how to say them. Sitcs say that kids say and do what there favorite actor says and dose on and off the air.       My conclusion says that all every thing with violance should be taken off the shelfs"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4104	2	"There are thousands of books in libraries now a days, some are from @NUM1 years ago. Books are books, and anyone at any age should be able to remove any type of book off of a shelf. Books, music, movies and magazines are all mad to interest people and what they enjoy reading. Authors and publishers should not be pentalized for their hard work they achieved.      There are many people in the world, who like all different types of books. But just because a book has censorship inside the story doesn't mean any human being will enjoy the story. I enjoy reading stories about romance, and I'm sure there is censorship inside a romance story.     I only prefer romance stories, and if every single romance story had censorship and libraries removed the books from the shelves, I wouldn't read any type of book. Because I only enjoy reading about the romance. I only find adults and young adults reading romance stories, and these people have the matureness not to act out about censorship.     It's not best to ruin the stories for adults and young adults who like to read about the censorship inside of stories. There many be people who find it so interesting, that if it's based on a true story then they would want to be willing to help the person out based on the situation.      Don't take away the chance for these authors to succeed more in life. Let these young adults read about everything they are interested in. I'm sure there are many different people who would be upset if the censored stories were eliminted from the shelves in libraries"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4111	2	"Have you ever been in that situation where you couldn't read a book because of someone else having bitter feelings towards it? Are you furious when you finally get a chance to read that book you've been waiting on for two months and all of a sudden it's not to your avalible because of its content? I know I always amd because at @ORGANIZATION1 this happens quite often. I believe that a book shouldn't be removed because only one person found it to be offense. Sure some novels @MONTH1 expose a few word of profanity or discrimination but everyone has to deal with it. So why take one book off the shelf for saying something vaulger because not everyone might dislike the book. If we took a book off the shelf everytime someone reported a bad word or a discrimitive remark then we would be left with no books including the ones that tell us a great deal about past history.     Some authors, movie directors and artist rely on history to help them create a great piece of reading, comentary, or lyrics. If the libraries in the public and in schools censored everything there could be a @ORGANIZATION1 risk of loosing alot of historic and epic material or information from the past. As im sure you know alot of history books about the holucaust, slavery, and the civil rights movement include words that people of certain genders or races @MONTH1 find offensive. These words are a vital source in the attempt to explain what the people in those situations are going through; therefore those words shouldn't be reported for histories sake.     I know im not alone in my fight to keep books on the shelf because an author named Katherine Paterson says, ' ... If i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same righ and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (Paterson). In this quote she is trying to say if people abuse this policy there will be no books left on the shelf for anyone to read becasue someone found something offensive to them. This is what will eventually happening if we don't censor the @CAPS1 in the libraries.     Now don't mistake me for someone who believes that @CAPS1 should be dropped all together becasue I believe it is needed in some cases. If there is a song that use profanity multiple times without any logical reasoning then it shouldn't be availible to the public through a library. Also if there are inappropriate movies I don't think that they should be distributed by the library to the public becasue thats what movies rental stores are for. On the other hand I haven't found a single book that isn't suitable for the library; so why are there so many books being takin away every year due to what some people call '@CAPS1' also known as  self opinions?     In this writing my goal was accomplished; I wanted to let everyone know that the whole @CAPS1 thing is getting a little out of hand. We all know that there is some offensive things that @MONTH1 be happening but they are things that everyone who views that book, movie, or soundtrack has to deal with. With some offensive things comes a reasoning like in history books and movies that @MONTH1 contain a few bad words but are used to get a point or setting across. I know that @CAPS1 is just another way of looking out for the better of humans but alot of it has a reason. The only case where @CAPS1 should be used is in innapropriate movies and songs with no hisrtoric purpose. With all that has been said, do you still believe in all of the @CAPS1 going on in your nearby library? How can you help prevent the destruction of all of the historic words in libraries?"	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
4114	2	"Everyone in the world has different opinions. Some people care about things that other people don't care about at all. One topic that seems to get everyone going is censorship. Everyone has an opinion on it; and not everyone agrees with eachother.     All libraries have different sections based upon age. There are childrens sections, teens sections, and adult sections. I think censorship has a lot to do with maturity levels. Things in books and movies that aren't appropriate for children, shouldn't be put in the children section. I understand parents' don't want their children reading or watching abscene material; but as kids are growing up, they're going to learn about the innapropriate things sooner or later in school.      I don't think anything should be taken off of a shelf just because a handful of parents find the material offensive. I don't take censorship very seriously. Some parents want their children reading books with innapropriate material so they can learn about what goes on in the world and what life is like. Most children and some teens don't know what the world is like because they don't get out much. They don't learn things that they should know already. Reading is a way of learning. When someone wants to know more information about any place or anything, they go to the library and check out a book. For a school project or just for fun.      Most parents agree that nothing innappropriate should be in a childrens' section at a library. Just because they're young and parents don't want their kids going around at the age of @NUM1 cussing like a sailor. But I think that teens are mature enough to read or watch innappropriate material like a book with cussing or a movie with kissing scenes. Parents shouldn't have a say on what goes on or off the shelves in a library. They should just mind their own business. If their kid picks out a book that they think is too offensive for them to read, then they can just simply tell them that they cannot get the book. It's as simple as that. Parents who ask for books to get taken off the shelf are just asking for too much.      Censorship in libraries is not a big deal to me. I think kids should be able to read a book that they want to read. At least they're wanting to read. Let them read for @PERSON1's sake. But like I said, everyone has their own opinions."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4117	2	"In the library I have noticed that there are a few literature materials that are not suitable for a younger age group. Such as rated @CAPS1 movies that contain things like drug use, sexual content, and extreme violence. Not all libraries have movies, and the ones that do don't let anyone under the age of @NUM1 rent out a rated @CAPS1 movie. Another example would be magazines that have articles/advertisments and pictures that are more towards the sexual side. This is a problem with children because then they think that that's how they should look and act, when they are older.     Most libraries are divided up into different sections, there is a section for adults, teens, and children. The sections were created for a reason to show/tell people that some materials in this section @MONTH1 not be suitable for teens and children. Then if your in a childrens section you know that not many over the age of @NUM2 will be wanting to look around for books. In the childrens section a library normally makes it look bright and colorful which most children love. This helps the children stay there and not wonder off into one of the adult or teen sections.      When I was younger I didn't really care to go into the adult or teen sections cause I enjoyed reading 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4', '@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8', and many other children books there. Children have a lot of things to satisfy them at the library there's children movies/shows like '@CAPS9 @PERSON1'. They also have an unlimited amout of books that can keep them entertained. If movies and books don't work for them then there are also a few toys they can play with (at least the libraries I've been to have toys).         The only real big problem with having things unapropriate in the library is that the younger teens might wander into the adult section, and sometimes there are adult things in the young adult section. Again with the movies, there are tv shows that I've seen at the library that are about teens doing drugs going to parties and getting drunk. Things like that I think put a bad influence on younger teens. Making them think it's okay to do drugs and drink, that it will make them more popular and cool.      Over all I think that libraries just need to reorganize there books, movies, and magazines. Then all the right items will be put in the right sections and there will be no accidents where someone accidently picks up something that is inapropitate for their age group. The music in the library I don't think is much of a problem. To me music is something more to express your feelings. This is my view on censorship in libraries"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4118	2	"@CAPS6 are many books out @CAPS6 that, if looked into, have something obsene or vulgar in it. Despite the fact that children of certain ages probably shouldn't be reading these types of things, the book itself should not be banned from the shelves of libraries.      Authors write or type every word for a reason, whether happy or sad or vulgar. @CAPS6 is a reason the author wants the reader to read these 'offensive' things. Everything you read in a book is @CAPS6 because the author wanted you to read it, not to just put it @CAPS6 to fill in or to be nasty. I agree that children shouldn't read these books with that kind of material in them but that doesn't mean take the books down. The library where I live has sections for children, teens, and adults so that @CAPS6 is no confusion or concern of the content of the book. You have to be of age in order to take some of the readings home. I personally think that this is a great idea and will comprimise both sides that don't want their kids reading these books and those who want to read the book without getting rid of anything. If the latter was taken in to effect though, some of the classic and prize winning books would be taken off the shelves, such as To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, The @PERSON1, @CAPS3 @CAPS4's @CAPS5, and much more. Such harsh actions aren't neccasary when a much simpler and more effective way to be accomplished.     Although offesive material is a concern for children @CAPS6 are much better ways to have it so they can't read them until ready. No book should be taken off a shelf for its content."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4120	2	"I believe that there are many books in a library that should not be avalible to everybody that goes into a public library. Yes there are some very offincive items in a library, such as a book about racism to african americans. No, that person who takes offince in those itmes does not have to be around them or even go into the library at all. The library is open to any and or everybody.      Lets suppose you have a young child, and you take him/her to the public library with you. As your looking for a book the child reaches to the highest book that he/she can reach, pulls it off the shelf and it lands on the floor open. You look down to see what had happened and you see the book lying there with an inappropriate picture right infront of your child. Thats your own fault, not the librarys.     Although many times its not the librarys fault where certain books are at, you should be more responsible and check out the area in which you are looking.      I think there should be a select area for which the 'inappropriate material' should be kept. And for a person to get into the select area they must show a membership type of identification, and sign a waver saying the material they have checked out will cause no trouble nor take offince to anybody in which the customer is around.     And that is my view on this subject."	2	3		2	3	3	3																		
4132	2	"Shut down libraries?     Yes, I do, because music, movies, etc. could not only contain unnessisarry attire, they could also contain potty mouth language.  The words could, and can, corupt the minds of youngsters.  All librairies put them there because of the needs of customers.  The things they do to make some cash around here, do you agree with me?     They should create seperate libraries for each type of reader.  Still, they put all of these things in the same building.  They should put up sales for kids' movies not adults, but the librarians say 'books are books'.  I think I'll write my own @CAPS1 sieries, thank you very much.     However, because some have dull enviornments, or lack of customers, some libraries close down.  Make use of that thought I just told you.  I wonder if some books on endangered species of fish.  But some kid's sieries are dieing of because of more popular ones, or being replaced by some family stories.     If a little kid were to listen to some cursing, his/her mind will be warped for life.  What chic-cursing out loud in front of the baby.  How about saying '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 that?..' or '@CAPS4 that ball, you meanie!'?  Maybe THAT will give some education.     However, some older boys and girls are teaching this bad language to the young mind-maybe even before they learn good language.  Those dilenguents don't care about their minds at all.  Your honor, I have my proof right here.  I suggest reeducating those teenage dilenguents to acting more @CAPS1."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4146	2	"These days there are many kinds of merdia in the liberaries beside books. There are musics, movies, magazines and many more. There are all kind of things and resources that you can find from liberaries. Do you think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves it they are found offensive? What do you think? I think it shouldn't remove. Even it is stuff that you don't want children to know, they will know someday. Once we remove it from the shelves then more things, the informations are going to removed. After all, nothings is going to be leaft.     There are a lot of imfornation in this world. Growing children learn all kind of stuff from parents, book and from other medias. Parent want to let their children to learn much as possible. However there are sutten things that parent doesn't want the children to learn. You need to think this way. That children will grow up and become adult, then they will know any way. Why would you move from the shelves, if they are going to know about it some how? What is a point about it? Doesn't removing from the shelves helps children to not know about it? I don't think there is a point to do that.     Katherine Paterson, the Author, said 'All of us can think of a books that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us'. I agree with Katherine. Once, the books or other mediea get removed because of some reason, other things are going to removed because of other reasons. I don't think it should be remove, like Katherine said there are nothing gonna leaft for the children. If nothing gonna leaft for the children what is main point of having libaries?     I believe the certain materials, such as books, music, magazines and many more, should be removed from the shelves it they are found offensive, because children will know and need to know to be adualt. Also there is nothing gonna leaft for the children in the libareries"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4147	2	"Should certaine materials on shelves that are offensive be removed from shelves? I believe that certaine materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that are offensive to people should not be removed from shelves. These materials are taken in perspective by all different kinds of people.     Offensive materials should not be taken off of shelves because something that is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to another person. People take things differently than other people might. For example, a lady might find a book to be disturbimg or offensive, while the man next to her can find that same book interesting and useful to him. Not one person is the same so not everybody will take offense to the same thing.     I also believe that if someone does not like the object that they are offended by then they do not have to look, purchase, or give attention to that object that is there on the shelve. He or she is not forced to buy, read, or watch what is offending them. The material that is offending that person is not purposley put there to offend them, it is there for people who are interested in it so that they can enjoy theresleves in whatever it is that they might be doing.     Therefore I do not think that materials that are offensive should be taken off of shelves. People have the right to things that they enjoy. A material should not be taken off of a shelve just because one person is offended by it. Different people have their own perspective of things and opinion of how things."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4148	2	"The thought that Katherine Paterson had in her quote is quite understandable. If we were to censor books then there would be nothing to read in libraries. If you really tried, in every book you could find something offensive. I somewhat agree with her; however, I do believe there should be rules on where books are located.     Books are ment to be read and taking them away would be horrible for every book loving person in this world. There are some things about where the books are to be found in the library that is up to dabate. Personally, I believe the childrens books should be on the opposite side of the building from the adult books and other reading material. In doing this you, for the most part, prevent the children from entering an area that is not age appropriate.     Teenage reading material should be seperate from both childrens books and adult reading material. In this way they are not around the material that is 'above their heads', so to speak. If this were done parents' minds could be put at rest for the time being. They would not have to worry about their child or teenager finding reading material that is inappropriate or offensive.     Books that some people find offensive should be catigorized, such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2'. They should also be catigorized as '@CAPS3', '@CAPS4', or 'Other'. In doing this most times where someone would have been offended are prevented from happening. Although there will be times where people will still find those books, and @MONTH1 be offended, @CAPS5 is manditory that we do our best to limit those times. All necissary precautions should be taken.      At the same time we should not remove any books from the shelves that are offensive to some. In removing a book from a shelf we would be eliminating a piece @CAPS2 or even life long lessons that are difficult to teach without experiencing them yourself. Books offer us as humans so much, from @CAPS2 to entertainment to even a form of comfort. Books are important to everyone whether they realize @CAPS5 or not. We have much to learn from books and we have much to offer our future members of the human race though books.     I do support Katherine Paterson's belief in that removing books from libraries would destroy the purpose of having them around. At the same time I believe there are ways to limit the times where people would be offended by something. Removing books would destroy countless years of @CAPS2, past thoughts, and past expeiences. Books should never be removed from libraries just because they @MONTH1 be found inappropriate."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4149	2	"I don't believe that certain material should be taken out of our libraries. If they take the books that people get a learning expresion off of then what does that leave us with. Everybody in life should have there own chocies, we shouldn't limit them.It's all about making chocies in life, people should get the right to read the books,magaizes, ect they want, With out people looking down on them or thinking the material they receve is unatural. What one person @MONTH1 think is not good read the next person might think the total oppoiste.     Music is a creative aspest in our world, @CAPS1 person you meet are not the same so @CAPS3 should music be. You can't have the same ideas when it's comes to making your creative looks on the music in your community it's not going to turn out the same as everyones elses will. If that was the case then the world would be one boreding place to live in. I think that @CAPS1 one has there on taste in music. If your the right age and your not hurting anybody, Then whats the big problem listing to the music that incourge you to become creative.      There are alot of movies that some parents might think that they are not good for there kids to watch. I think that we shouldn't be so worried about what our kids are watching and more what there doing. I think that @CAPS1 movie you watch has a sercet point in it, In other words the lesson learned in the story. Some solutions that happen in real life might be on a movie that's probably rated @CAPS2. I don't believe that we should be focus on the rating of the movie, We shold be focus on the lesson the movie is teaching you.               The children in the world are going to have to make there own chocies and what they find intresing, @CAPS3 should we band everything we thinks thats not. We need you let the children grow on there own and aslo learn on there own. Can't make somebody listen, read or watch what he want them to.

4152	2	"I certainly don't believe books, magazines, etc.. should be taken off the shelves in libraries just because they're offensive to a certain amount of people. For one of the reasons are in the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 it states that you have the freedom of speech and when you write a book or an article in a magazine you are writing a story on whatever you want and if it is put on a shelf in the @CAPS1 place it should stay there. Also, just because it is offensive to one certain group or person doesn't give anybody the right to take something off the shelf in the library because the author is speaking what they want.     Also in magazines today there are many offensive things to certain people such as celebrities, sports stars, etc... but they don't go to the libraries and take them off the shelf. If you were one of those people that did take a book or magazine off the shelf I think you should ask other people what they think about that material, because some people @MONTH1 like it. Also if you keep taking all the books off the shelf what will we have to read and educate ourselves about today, and read stories that were told for generations? If you do see one of those reading materials and they are offensive to you just put it back up on the shelf; and act like you never picked it up."	3	3		3	3	4	3																		
4154	2	"One of the amendements in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 is freedom of speech, this amendment gives the freedom of speech to anyone who has something to say, as long as what they have to say does not interfere with the @CAPS2 of others. It has been long since passed that the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 was signed, but even today there are questions on the subject that still remain; should people be allowed to censor books? This is a matter that has been disputed throughout the history of humans, and has been the a topic of great contraversy for many years.     Some say that one should have the right to censor a book that they find offensive. However, if one would take the time to think on the issue they @MONTH1 see that if everyone had the right to censor a book that they dispised, there would not be any books left in the world. In a population that contains so many different cultures and ethinicities, and reaches to almost every corner of the @LOCATION1, writing a book that everyone could enjoy and not find offensive could be an impossible task.     We on @LOCATION1 live in a very diverse society, and liturature has, over the decades and centuries, adapted to the different types of customs, cultures, and religions so that anyone can find a book that they enjoy. The way of life that one lives @MONTH1 be different from that of others, but one should respect and accept the different ways of living, just as liturature has. It is like being in school, there has many times been that one student that the rest of the class see as really different. Our teachers taught us to be nice and accept that student for who they were and that not everyone is the same.     Even after this and many other articles have been written about the topic, it will still remain a topic of much debate. This is becuase everyone is different, and has their own opinions. Some say it is a great idea, and others say everyone is entitled to their own ways of living. However the issue will go on, because after all we are all different and have our own opinions."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4160	2	"Have you ever been to a library and found a book offensive?In my opinion I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are at the library for a reason. The reason being say if we wanted to check out a movie and everywhere else was to expensive to get it, why wouldn't you just get it at the library if they had it. Most libraries that I've gone to have certain sections for adults and children. That means there would be appropiate things for little children to read in the section that they have been given. If children under age were to wander off into the adult section that would be their fault if they saw something unapproiate not the libraries.     If the case was if every time a child or someone under age took a book offensive, I belive that the libraries wouldn't have as much of books in their buildinds that grown ups would like to read. Of course I'm not trying to say that there should be extermely unappropriate books wandering around in the library that the small children should see. I'm just saying that the adults do have the right to have books that they would be interested in.When I've gone to the libraries I have found books that I have enjoyed reading and I'm not the type of person that would just grab a book and be interested in right away. There are books, movies, magazines, and music that have strange titles that some people might take offensive to, but those are the ones that get read more or listend to more or watched more.     I believe that no material should be taken off of the shelf just because one person found it offensive. If the person doesn't like the idea of the people in the library not taking the material off; it's the person personal problem I think. For example there is this book called '@CAPS1' and it's about a teenager who got into drugs real bad and got pregnate at a young age. That book was one of the best selling books in the world. If somebody took that offensive and asked for the book to be removed then it's their loss.     I mean if there were a book about how to murder somebody then yeah I would ask for that material to be taken off the shelf immeditely. Except no library in this entire world would have that kind of stuff up so why worry about it.If there were ever to be that type of situation then that would be bizzare.But I highly doubt that it would come to a point like in time. So in conclusion that is my opinion on this"	3	3		3	3	4	3																		
4164	2	I go to the libbrary every @DATE1 of every week. Although I don't really read that much. I usualy get movies or music. If I do get a book to read its usualy a magazine or something for school.     I don't think that books should be removed. If you don't read them it doesent mean that other people don't. If you don't like the book just ignore it and go on its simple as that. For instens if I found a book about @CAPS1 or about the @CAPS2 fathe I would not read it for my self but I would not take it down off of the shelf. Other people might want to read it. It's there choice to read it not mine.     It's like the radio know. The radio plays songs and cuts out the curis words. I don't think that they should do that because it messies up the songs lyrics and it is going aginst the artists words. The artist sings the song but people chang his or her words. To me I don't think thats right. It's also like telivtion now. You see the movie in theaters or on @CAPS3 and they have bad language or bad seens in them. When you watch that same movie on telivtion they take out about @NUM1 minuts of the movie because of th bad seen or they cut out the languge.     To me I think every thing should stay. I think if you don't want your kids to see it just block it but don't cut out parts from the movie it's not fair to the other people. If people don't like some music then just swich the radio station to another area on the radio. Theres no need to take the words out. Kids are going to pick the words up in school or off the streets any way. I also think seence we are having to pay so much taxes I think we should get the privilage to come home and watch movies on telivtion and relax	3	3		3	3	3	3

We have a freedom of speech even if those words are offensive to others.  Things on the internet are offensive and no one can mandate how it is veiwed either.  The same should go for a library.     I understand a parent's concern with their child reading or listening to things that are not appropriate.  Some of the things authors write can be either innapproraite or offensive.  That is their freedom of speech.  We can not take that away from them but there should be some censorship at least to the apprearance of books.  For music and movies they usually have a warning lable if it is not intended for younger kids.  It might be a good idea for some libraries to do the same with books and magazines.      In order to see a rated, '@CAPS1', movie you have to be over @NUM1 and for a good reason because of the mature content.  The books being writen now are more and more mature.  But if we take on the custom of being of certain age for books we might invaid the privacy of others.     No one has the right to remove books from a library's shelf on the count of being offensive.  Who can judge whether something is offensive? The libraries are publicly owened and therefore have no one owner.  The city owns them.  If there is a problem with whether a book should be at the library it is the city's decision.  Even if there is such an uproar about one book, unless the decision is unnanimous, no book should be taken off the shelves.  The book should simply be put in a spot either behind the counter or where it is available only on request.      Taking books off the shelves I beleive is taking away from the public's ability to read.  If a parent is concerned about what their child might read, they should confront their local librarian.  The librarian @MONTH1 be able to help them retrieve books that are appropriate and apealing to their child."	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
4170	2	"Today's books in are libraries are sometimes offensive. Yes, I know they are about thing that happen in history. Other books are not, some more than others. They are about killing, shooting, doing drugs,ect.      First, I don't want my children growing up thinking @CAPS2 okay to steal, do drugs, or anything of that sort. I'v seen books that have no meaning at all that should be in are libraries. The kids might think they are good books to read, I think other wise. Books that fourth graders read that have bad words in them.     Secondly, @CAPS1 are fun to read, i know they are. You have to look at it this way im of age to read those kind of books but, letting little kids read those books is not okay with me or other people. If it where up to me i would take some of the really bad books, music, movies, and magazines out. @CAPS2 not up to me, it takes more than one person to do that. It would'n be fair if it was all up to me because the person next to me might not think the way  i am.     Next, @CAPS2 okay to take a movie and watch it or even ask for some music to lesson to. As long as @CAPS2 okay to watch or lesson to. Im just saying what i think would be right. Not everone think's the same. People @CAPS3 @CAPS1 kids watch, and lesson to all kinds of music and movies. As long as @CAPS2 okay with the perant it should be okay.       Lastly, @CAPS3 kids be kids. Have them grow up the way they want to grow up. Yes, that might sound dumb to the next person but it sounds okay with me. At the end of the day you still get to teach them not to lesson or do that kind of stuff in the books."	3	2		3	3	3	3																		
4178	2	"I think that the music and other things besides books should stay in the libary. Honestly thats where a lot of people go and find other music, yes it could be offinsive to some people, but to others its not. They have the right to say they dont want to listen to that stuff, so they dont have to. The libary holds over a @NUM1 different kinds of music, movies,magazines, ect. So if theres over that many, then why should other people be limited to what they read, hear , and look at?     The libary is where people go to find new things and explore what other people find interesting. Why would they put it in there just to take it all away. I remember going to the libary as a young child and looking around me, i saw all these other people look at things i have never even heard of, granted i was only @NUM2, but my point is that, people grow into what they like, they arent just born liking something and thats it.       I think the library is perfect just the way it is. I think that if anything we should put more differnet kinds of music. I know not everybody likes the same music, so why would you wantt o force them to? I think that the @CAPS1.S is populating more and more everyday, that all we can do is just extend it in every way posible.     Keeping in mind that not everybody likes to read books, they just find reading magazines and watching movies interesting. I know im a person that would much rather watch a movie, or listen to music than read a book.Not everybody is the same, so why would you want to trea them that way.     Being @NUM3, and if i had to listen to disney tracks all the time, i think i would drive myself crazy. I listen to the things i listen to because i have interest in them, if somebody took away my music away i wouldnt know what to do with myself. I guess i would just have to readthe books i dont like, and listen to the music i cant stand.     The music should stay in the libraries because thats where it belongs, you cant make everybody happy"	4	3		4	3	2	3																		
4185	2	"We live in a world @DATE1 inundated and persuaded by media.  Ever since we were little, our young minds have been filled with opinions of others from history and from the present.  Whether we are reading a book, watching a motion picture, or even listening to a new music artist, our lives are being affected by such media.     The art world is considered to be one of the most controversal businesses to work in.  Each piece of literature or movie is shared by a vast community of critics.  We all are given the right to our opinion on such  pieces.  Every piece of art is judged and then criticized.  However, many find certain pieces to be offending in some way, shape, or form.  It is quite impossible to produce such a piece that will fit everybody's satisfaction.  For an example, religious pieces are often scorned for their nonfactual information or for the director's or author's opinion over the matter.  Since we live in such a diverse community of religions, these pieces will never satisfy the audience.  Movies have been criticized for decades because they represent some sort of life lesson or truth that is not appealing to the audience.  Why not learn from them and reflect?     No piece of media can possibly be directed to satisfy the opinions of all the world.  As a personal example, I can see that novels and books over war are heavily criticized.  The men and women who fought for our country @MONTH1 enjoy to see such pieces written about them, but war protesters and peace keepers @MONTH1 see this as an insult to their cause.       @PERSON1 wrote a book by the name @CAPS1 @NUM1.  This book was heavily criticized over the topic of censorship.  The world in which they lived in had dramatically been affected by the impact of peoples opinions.  If a book or movie was offensive to a group of people, then they burned the books.  History books about slavery and war were burned because others found the topics offending.  Non-religious groups thought that religion was offensive, so they burned the @CAPS2 and other works of religion.  Their government wanted a world of peace and a community where every man was equal and diversity was no longer existent.      @PERSON1 denies the book was written over censorship but his book gives our generation a great lesson.  For generations, we have grown up in a world of diversity.  Every mind is special and different and will never share identical thoughts as his neighbor.  Therefore, we must recognize that we have to survive and live together.  We can not escape the diversity in which we live in.  The books we see on shelves, the movies we see on the big screen, and music we listen through our earphones all make up our generations history and the next.  We need to accept our neighbor and his opinions because we are all born equal.  If we throw away our history and our accomplishments, man is left nothing to improve on, nothing to leave his or her marking on history.  We have to accept others ideas and build on them to improve our life and other's.  As we stand @DATE1 in a world filled with diversity, we must move on and reflect.  It is not a time to offend and be offended but a time to learn and move on"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4201	2	"Libraries hold more than just books, magazines, and movies... They hold history. With out any doubt, there is offensive material printed on numerous pages spread through out the thousands of books and magazines a library holds. Some find this terrible, but I on the other hand, completly disagree. Every book has a different story to tell, and everyone comprehends the content differently so I think libraries shouldn't take out offensive material from their shelves.      What's really considered offensive? This question would be very hard to answer because everyone has a different veiw, different opinons, and a different background. Some would say violence, drugs, gangs, and sexual situations are offensive... While others consider religion, beliefs, traditions, and morals offensive. With all the different veiws on what someone finds offensive, a library would have to almost completly clean their shelves just to remove a small porportion of it.      There's many sections in a library, from fiction to children stories. If there is an area for 'children books,' and 'adult books,' @CAPS1 can't there be one for materials some readers would find offensive? Libraries could even mark a book if it held something offensive.This would settle many conflicts! If a reader chooses to read a book that was marked with offensive content, they would have no right to get upset.       Limiting our libraries shelves is unthinkable. If someone got offended by what they read, they could put the book down just as fast as they picked it up. A public library is a public place, where many people go... so if one person gets offended by something they read or saw, doesn't mean the next person will. Bottom line is, no book should be taking away because someone couldn't handle what was being sad.     'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 everyone's veiw on offensive material is different, eliminating it would be hard. One person found this book offensive, so it's gone... The library would be pointless. The shelves would empty, because the loss of many phenomenal books. People do get offended, that's just life... I don't think that they should be able to take a book away from everyone just because of one person's opinon on it"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4209	2	"The ideas conveyed by literature, music, and movies are an art.  They cannot be explained in any other way than themselves, and if we take away the right to produce or the right to sell these masterpieces, then the world loses something of itself.     Censorship is the underlying problem to many things.  It takes away the expression of human thought and emotion- emotions like greed, love, fear, and the ability to empathize that are conveyed in books and films.  If people think it's offensive, they simply can't take the truth.       Many people can only express themselves in their art- and art can be very real.  So real that we don't think that it's possible.  We don't want to believe something like 'The @CAPS1' could happen.  'The @CAPS1' is a short story in which kids get together and rob an old man's home.  Because this man is very rich, he has lots of material wealth.  Then they burn down the house with the man's belongings still in it.  Needless to say, this story has been banned from many schools and libraries.  But what many don't understand is why would the kids burn down the house.  Many think that the kids just want to see it burn, to destroy what is so cherished, or that the love of material things is making us greedy.  It is this that makes us think, and therein lies the problems with censorship.  If we censor something that makes us think this hard about who we are and what we do here, then we begin to lose ourselves.     The loss of books has been seen throughout history.  Most prominantly, the nazi regime.  In the beginning of their control of power, they banned certain books that went against the nazi ideals.  The censorship escalated into the nazis burning books in large piles. This communal burning would make it easier to control the public mindset.  The movement swelled and the  @CAPS3 people soon developed a national pride and goal.  By the @DATE1's, nearly every @CAPS3 who could read had read '@CAPS5 @CAPS6'.  The censorship had turned into an all-out war on classical literature and the promotion of nazi ideas.  That was how @CAPS7 was actually voted in.  Many don't realize, but the @CAPS8 actually did vote @CAPS7 to be leader.  Now that the nazis had destroyed the publics ideals, they were replaced with the nazi's own.     The banning of media can only lead to a general lack of self knowledge.  The human mindset can only be expressed through the art which the human creates.  If we try to explain it, we soon get lost in our words.  The use of verbal and visual examples is the only way we learn who we are.  Censorship has never ended in something good- only the promotion of something bad.  If we let our media get banned, we lose the right to have ideas of our own."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4218	2	"Materials that are found offensive should not be taken off the shelve. People might need those materials for research or if they just want to find out about something. If the material is offensive to someone they can report it but the people that work at the library might not do anything about it. The people that find something offensive could also ignore it and walk away.     If I found something that was offensive to me I would just ignore it. I might look at it to see what it says but I would not say anything about it. There are some people that would have to look at that for research or something else. So why get it removed from the shelve? I have not seen anything that would be offensive to me yet but, if I did then I would not say anything. Now some people would say something but, what if you walked in a library looking for a book for your research paper, and it was not there because someone found it offensive? What would you do? Yes you could get on the internet but, it might not have what you are looking for exactly.     I have had a lot of research papers. There was one time when I went to the library and could not find a book or a magazine to help me with my research. I had to wait for over an hour just to get on the computer to look information up. When I did get on the computer I only had an hour to look up everything. I did not get it done in time and had to turn it in late. Computers are good for looking up stuff, but when you have a book in mind that would give you a lot of information, you go for the book not the computer.     I know there are materials that are offensive to people. I know people get mad at them but, it is not the librarys fault. They most likely have to have those materials on the shelve because that is whats required of them. So if people do get mad they can report it or just walk away and ignore it."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4219	2	"To @CAPS1 it @DATE2 concern,     @CAPS2 in life has to deal with something offensive towards them at least once. It @DATE2 be swear words in a popular song, or even people's behavior and actions on a regular basis. Be that as it @DATE2, nobody was made perfectly, and we all have to learn to cope with people's flaws. The library is for everyone; not just you specifically. Just like people's personalities we have to deal with different things that fit those specific personalities. @PERSON1's quote said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right...' @CAPS3 is a strong and truthful accusation, and I believe that things in a library should should have some censorship, but up to a specific point.     We all realize that the biggest population of people in a library-- and perhaps the most innocent-- are children. Each parent has different values and standards for their child. What @DATE2 be offensive to one parent @DATE2 not be to another. If one mother thinks a book that talks about something she believes to be inappropriate to her children should be removed, another mother @DATE2 not. The first mother's opinion is different than everyone else; she could say she wanted @CAPS3 book removed from the library, but then so could the second mother about a different book. If everyone voiced their opinion on what books they didn't think were appropriate for their children, then we would 'have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' according to Katherine Paterson. I believe she is right. Besides, who is to say what is right for everyone?     Not one person has the same morals or values as another. For one person to declare what is right could highly offend another individual. I have dealt with situations like @CAPS3 before; everyone has. People tell me what they believe to be right, and I do not agree with them. It is simply a matter of everyday life; people's opinions and morals are going to clash. Eveyone is different, and if one person doesn't like a certain magazine in the library, another person @DATE2 not like a different one. If we were to all voice our own opinion on what we want censored and what we don't, nothing would be left. The library shelves would be completely empty. Even though everyone has different opinions on what should stay and what should go, I do believe that there should be some censoring up to a certain point.     Taking into account everyone's diversification in @CAPS3 world, I do believe that there should be censorship up to a certain point. If something is in a book that a good majority of the population are against, I believe that the book, or books should be removed. I am not saying that because a couple of people weren't for a certain artist from the @DATE1 that it should be taken away at once. If it is a major issue that highly offends many people, it should not be in a public library. Libraries are for obtaining information, and for reading; not for brewing up offensive opinions on certain topics. There should be a certain limit on what is in a library, because there are things out there people really shouldn't be seeing or hearing. But it shouldn't get to the point where people can just remove books from the shelf at their own free will. Without some limit on censorship in a library, absolutely anything could be found there.     When we think of a library we don't think of things that are offensive. People view the library as a positive place, created for people's own personal enjoyment. That doesn't mean that we will never find something that @DATE2 offend us in some way there, but people should not be able to just remove books from the shelf because they don't agree with their morals. @CAPS2 is different, and nobody has the right to tell them what exactly is right or wrong, up to a certain point. I know from experience that it can be a tough thing to ignore sometimes, but we all seem to do it everday with the people around us; we can't just choose to get rid of them. @CAPS2 wants to be comfortable, but sometimes we just have to deal with things in life like a book we don't deem appropriate. So I believe that in a way, an excessive amount censorship on things in a library can be a bad thing. If we all could get rid of what we wanted in a library, there would be nothing left. Afterall, I wouldn't mind walking into a library with shelves full of magazines and books, instead of one completely empty.     Thank you."	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
4226	2	"Movies is to popcorn as music is to headphones. Right? It is all fun and games until someone's innocence is completely destroyed. The simplest forms of entertainment are being minipulated by today's world. Many of the children in our modern society are quickly becoming conditioned and used to seeing and reacting to media found in the everyday store, shop, or library. The innocence of the youth today is slowly being destroyed by the subliminal messages found in music, magazines, and movies. The messages are all the same in each type of media: sex, drugs, and violence.      The world of music has evolved so much over the past decades of time. We go from jazz, disco, funk, rock, hard rock, to hip- hop/rap. All of these types belonging to a certain decade. But in our era, the music industry is exploding with rap and hip- hop music. This type of music is triggered towards the three ideas of sex, drugs, and violence. Almost every song that is heard today on the radio or on your iPod will most likely have something to do with one of those three. The sense of being so naive and so innocent is broken after listening to these songs everytime the radio is on. The youth does not need to be listening to this whatsoever and therefore, parents should be more aware about what their children are listening to and should think more about the effects that the media has on them.     Recently, more and more people are turning to articles and segments of works to read instead of the 'good old fashioned' novels. The novels that were written before our era are clean and nonexplicit. But today, literature has gone down a new course. More and more, @ORGANIZATION1 companies are becoming less tradional and more upfront about topics that are sexual, violent, or drug related. For example, in @ORGANIZATION1, you will see articles strictly pretaining to sex-like actions. Possibly on the other side of the page, you will see an ad for @CAPS1 cigarettes. Soon enough, kids are going to think that everything they are seeing and looking at will be okay and soon act upon it. The libraries that are offering these magazines for rental should restrict children from reading them due to the lack of modesty and morals found in these magazines.      There has always been a sense of subliminal messaging throughout the development and evolution in the cinematic world of movies. Movies are a timeless object of entertainment. But recently, the subtle or blunt 'hints' of sex, drugs, and violence is portayed in almost all movies offered in the box office today. There have been those action packed movies where there is all the fighting and the blood and the punching. Then there are the sappy movies where all it seems the main characters do is have emotional fights that are soon resolved by a session of steamy sexual actions. These types of movies are offered in libraries nationwide and are easily accessible to children. The youth of our country do not need to be seeing all of these actions and hearing these messages. In no way, shape, or form is this morally correct.      All in all, library censorship is very weak. The people who organize and let this kind of media float around for kids to pick up have some moral issues that need to be checked. The more times a child reads, listens, or watches media with subliminal or blunt messages about sex, drugs, and violence, the more they are going to think it is okay to act and do these actions.  All sense of innocence is destroyed and children are not children anymore"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4229	2	"I personally believe that there shouldn't be a whole lot of censorship in libraries, except for things such as complete smut and pornography. However there are many different beliefs on this subject. Some parents @MONTH1 think it's necessary to control every bit of information a child takes in, while others are more forgiving.     The main conflict with this issue is how different everyone's restrictions are. A lot of parents believe that if any politically incorrect information enters their child, he/she will be corrupted for life, but that is completely false. Nowadays, almost every single person goes through something traumatic, witnesses something illegal, gets involved in drama, experiments sexually, and/or experiments with drugs. The truth is, it's everywhere, and your kids have already experienced it and are used to it. Reading one book with a couple curse words here and there, or an intimate moment isn't going to ruin your child, because chances are, he/she is already doing it all in real life. It @MONTH1 even be happening in your own home and there is nothing that can be done to stop it. Trying to control our lives as if it was your own provokes kids to rebel even more when the chance arises.     I say don't worry about censorship in libraries except for the obvious things like pornography, and sex novels, racist books,  ect. Maybe if we quit hiding so much from the more mature teenagers, and quit treating them like toddlers, they wouldn't go looking as much for all of the 'bad' things out there. Parents need to quit thinking they can get their child to believe there is nothing bad in the world. If they aren't aware of the mistakes that can be made and the consequences from it, they won't know what to do if they find themselves in a similar situation as one of the characters in one of these 'offensive' books"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4239	2	They should be aloud to be removed because some books are offensive. Even if they are offensive they can teach young teenagers about their past. The books could be about the kkk or the @ORGANIZATION1. Some young teens like to read books like this so they can learn and see what people went threw. The books could be a school assignment.           The way i see it is if your teenage child is interested in the history or the violence of the past you should allow them to read what they want. Some book such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS6 are great to read for school assignments. These @CAPS6 book's are very helpful to read because you can learn about your history and about the wars at the same time. I think if your child checks a book out from the library he or she should return it in a week.     The library should give the child a certain amount of time to return the book. If the child dose not return the book in that amount of time they should charge them for every day it is late. If the book is damaged they shud charge who ever checked that book out. The book shud be in the condition it was in when it left so other people can check it out after its returned. the library should keep certain books at the library such as the bible and collage books.      The libary should allow @CAPS6 books to each person. Instead of three or four this would keep books on the shelfs. It would also keep people from loosing books. I think people under twenty @CAPS3 should not be aloud to check out movies or music. I think they should have to show i.d. to prove there over twenty @CAPS3. there should be more rules then just being quit in the library they should make people start keeping books at the library and only allow them to take home @CAPS3 or @CAPS6 books. For instance i check out @CAPS3 book every week and return the @CAPS3 i checked out the same day i go to get a new @CAPS3. I only check out the book i really want to read and i read it and return it. The magazines should never be checked out.	3	3		3	2	2	2																		
4242	2	"We as @CAPS1 have the right to say what we want, and do as long as it is within the laws. If they take away some books because they are racey or because some people find them wrong, then they are saying we shouldn't learn the history of our civilization. A great man once said '@CAPS2 who do not learn from the past are condemed to repeat it.' @CAPS3 is saying that if we take away the books that are even obscured we are taking that history away from our children and they will do the same mistakes that we have done in our lifes.     Taking away the content that is obsene will make our children unknowledgable to the fact that it happened or how the past really was. '@CAPS4 @CAPS5's @CAPS6' is under critism because it uses the '@CAPS7-word' alot in the text. There is no reason to change the book because that is how the people talked, back in the day, and how things were done. If they change the book they change history and they take away knowledge from the children of tomorrow that slavery was a harsh, harsh thing.     When I think of censorship in the library, I think of how the @ORGANIZATION1 is trying to change the past and how it is trying to nurf the childrens history of what really happened. Censorshiop should be on tv, movies, and music so the little kids dont see the wrong things to earl, but when it comes to lititure in the library they shouldn't do it at all because only the liturate people will know what it means and what the text is actually saying. There should not be a censhorship in the lititure of the past, the present, and the future."	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
4244	2	"I believe that everyone's opinion deserves to be publicized fairly. Just because one person's view is considered to be right, doesn't mean another is wrong. What is offensive to one person @MONTH1 be informative to another.     I've read a lot of books that parents @MONTH1 not pick out for their children. In reading these books I see that there is no glamour in doing drugs or getting in trouble with the law. For some teens, books like these can show them the side of life they haven't experienced and find that they never want to.     If a book is too explicit for children, simply place the book in another section. I realize that there are books with graphic sexual details, and those should only be premitted to be checked out by adults. Parents should have concerns about their children's innocence. But I also believe that they should watch over what type of books they're reading too monitor the vulgarity of them.     Some @CAPS1 contain profanity or sexual induendoes, some contain praise and worship, others even have screaming. Any of thses type of musics can be found offensive by someone. That doesn't mean to run off and hide all of them. There'd be no @CAPS1 left.     Not everyone shares the same opnions in this world, therefore there should be equal opportunity for people to read,watch, or listen to whatever suits them. I'm not saying that there should be a stock of porn in the library, but if there are movies or books about shunned religions or beliefs then they should be just as welcomed as the ones about common religions and beliefs.     Everyone finds different things offensive. If there was a bible in the library and someone found it offensive, should it be removed? It's one of the most popular books in the world, yet some people still find offense by it. Someone who is mormon, muslim, or athiest might find offensive if there is nothing in the library about them because some people find it offensive.     The library is a place of knowledge, not judgement. I dont't believe that certain books should be removed from the library if they offend someone. If you don't like something that is at the library, don't rent it. If you don't want your children to, don't let them. Simple as that. Everyone is entiled to freedom of speech. Authors express themselves through books and articles, directors through movies, and musicians through their music."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4260	2	"Let's say you walk into a public library and you look upon a book that is racist or is offensive to you.  You believe that the book shouldn't be on the shelf so you take it off.  I believe that you have the right to take that book off the shelf.  It isn't just books either; it can be music, movies, magazine, or many others.  The authors have the right of freedom of speech but it can go the other way around too.  There are many reasons why and I will explain this to you.     The first reason why is that the person might not come back to that place.  I mean if somebody walks into a library and trys to find a book to read, do you think they will ever come back if they are offended by one?  A little while back, I was in the library and I noticed a book that was offending.  It was talking jokes about black people.  I believe that isn't right because all people are equal no matter how they look or what they believe.       The next reason is that it could cause rate of the materials to go down.  If somebody gets offensive about a censored material, they are going to report it and cause the rate to drop low.  No library wants to hold books, music, movies, or magazines that have been reported by their community and nobody wants it.  How would the author feel about their material getting reported because of somebody getting offensive by it?  If the author wants to offend anybody, then they shouldn't even bother to publish it.     The last reason is to get rid of the materials.  Nobody wants to look at something that offends them.  How would you feel that you took a movie home to watch the family and it had bad stuff in it and you didnt like it.  You get offended and complain.  Complaining is bad for business especially if its a government building.  If we just get rid of the things that offend people, then we wouldn't have any problems.     I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelf if sombody if offended by it.  There are really three main reasons.  One is the the person might never come back to that place. Next, is that it could cause rate success drop down low.  The last is to just get rid of the materials so they are no complains.  Now, what do you believe"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4262	2	"Lots of people come to the library to check out books, music , movies , and other things for entertainment. Mainly children use the library more than any other age. The library is a place where you can be humble and relaxed. No one wants to check out thinks that are offensive in any type of way. Not even books that will influence bad things. Therefore certain things shouldn't be allowed to be checked out in libraries.     Certain movies shouldn't be in the library. For example if a  child go to library they @MONTH1 see a movie that contains sexual activity and decided to check the movie out. The kid @MONTH1 be  underage and the movie would be considered inappropriate. The child @MONTH1 get in trouble by there guardian. In reality it would be the librarian's fault for letting the child check the movie out. That is why the movies should be censored.     On the cover of many magazines women as well as men bodies are exposed.That @MONTH1 cause children to be attracted to the magazine. They @MONTH1 even decided to check the magazine out. Children are influenced by the things they see. Seeing naked bodies would be considered setting a bad example.      In today's world all children listen to music. The music you listen to has a huge impact on your life. The music in libraries should be censored. Libraries should have music that encourage you to go out and be something in life. In my opinion only influential music should be able to be rented out.     Reading is the key to success. Libraries should have books that will help you increase your vocabulary as well as educate you. Not the books that will talk about sexual things or even make you wonder about sex. Libraries should only have history, math , and educational books.     In conclusion everything in the library should be censored. A lot of children use the library. Therefore it should be age appropriate. No child needs to be put under a bad influence. Certain thinks should be removed from the shelves to keep down less confusion."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4263	2	"I think that movies and magazines should be removed from the shelf because they might have some stuff in it that little kids could look at or watch. The movies and magazines will sometimes give some kids some ideas and the books should be removed because it had some words that people will be saying and the music should be removed because they have rap music. People shouldn't be listening to it. The music is sometimes not appropiate for all age and it can give people some ideas of what they say or do. The books and magazines can give people some ideas of what they say or do and they can believe anything of what they say. People should be reading good books and reading good magazines and listen to some good music. They are all offensive because they talk about bad stuff and doing bad stuff or talk about how they live their lives. Peolpe shouldn't be listening to some rap music or read the magazines or read some books that will give other people some ideas. The books sometimes talking about what happened a long time ago and stuff like that and it sometimes offense people like that. The magazines sometimes tell people what happened in the past and thenpeople don't want to read any magzines anymore. The people don't want to listen to any music anymore or read any books anymore. Most people will think that most books, magazines, and music are bad for the kids and for the adults. I think that it is offensive because music is not a good thing to listen to like rap or hip-hop. The people shouldn't be listening to rock music and they should just listen to some music that are appropiate. The books should be appropiate for all age and they should read something that they like. They should read some magazines that they like and that are good and appropiate.  The music is offensive because they talk about inapproiate  stuff and they shouldn't be listening to it and the magazines have some inappropiate stuff and the books have some inappropiate stuff. The people won't like it and they might not want to check it out again or they won't check nothing out. I think that they should put some books on the shelves that people will like and the music that people will like. They should put some magazines on the shelves that people will want to look at or read"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4265	2	"In libraries, there are of course books. There are mysteries, romances, comics, biographies and anything else that you @MONTH1 be able to think of. There are also magazines, movies, and even cd's that are at the libraries now. Then at libraries there are also those books and magazines. Those books being the ones I would never pick up off of the shelf myself let alone allow my future children to pick up. This is because those books contain material that is not at all conducive to the young person's brain. That is why I would like those books to be cencored so my child would never even know that the books are there.     These books have in them people having sex and smoking drugs and their language in theses books are horrifying! These seem to be the kinds of books that young children have become interested in. They read them at school and get them somehow from their friends. They also find them in libraries and the more they read the more they want to do because they are influenced very easily. They are influenced by books characters that dont even exist some of the time.       There are many reasons of why I feel that the books should be cencored but one of the biggest reasons are that because young people read these kind of books they go out and do what they read in the books. Thinking its okay because somebody that is not even real, most of the time, is doing it. I feel that these books are the reason that babies are raising babies children that are ten are going out having sex and getting pregnant and becoming eleven year old mothers. Where is that even heard of, but it happens and by the time those same children become freshmen in high school, if they even get there, they are carrying the responsibility of the baby they had when they were eleven. Those same children go through life wondering how different their stiuations could have been! So I feel like before these books go and mess up a whole other generation of children why don't we stop it here? Why does another child have to get pregnant at the age of ten for someone else to realize it's time to change things?     Ten year old children are still just babies! The human brain isnt even fully developed until you are in around the age of twenty-five. So these children dont know if what they are reading is wrong beucase they haven't been taught that it is very wrong this is because at that age no parent expects that they will have to teach their not to have sex. Why you @MONTH1 ask, because at the age of ten what child should know about sex? At that age they still like to color and play with baby dolls or they like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 they should even be thinking about sex let alone know what it is.      These materials should be taken off the shelves because children reading or looking at these kinds of books and magazines in libraries should not be happening. To stop yet another generation from messing up their lives taking the materials off is the best solution. After all shouldn't a parent get the chance to make sure their child isn't killing their chances to live a happy life in the future?"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4268	2	"I think that some books should be banned from libraries that are offensive or use certain words against people, I think that should apply to highschool libraries because it really would matter in elementeries because they wouldn't know what some things mean. If a class were to read an offensive book and someyone in the class from the opposite race that reads the book others could get affended and it could start a fight.     Some high schoolers could get affended quicker than others and which could cause a lot of problems so by avoiding that there should be votes on books that should be banned or not be aloud to be read in class or in school period. Im pretty sure people would think its dumb to ban books but trust it me it would solve a lot of problems, but it all comes down to whats acceptable and whats not without hurting other peoples feeling and putting them down.     I bet all the time in classes theres been a story that has been read that has talked about races which makes others not feel comfortable, and theres always that person that always trys to make fun of something, but if I were in this situation I would try my best to not let others get to me and interfer with my grades and performance. I would just ignore them as much as possible and if it did start getting annoying I would talk to my counselor about trying to talk to that person individually or just removing me from class. I'm pretty sure most schools wouldnt tolerate this type of behavior but you will always have those kind of kids you just have to ignore.               You should never not go to school thinking you don't fit in just because someyone is making fun of your race or how you look. They just try to make the day harder on you and all you have to do is ignore them or report it and hopefully it is taken care of"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4279	2	"Keep it on the shelvesThe reason for libraries is so that people can read what they want to read. If I owned a library I would have everything on the shelves because there are alot of people and not everyone likes the same thing. Truthfully I wouldn't care because it isnt just about a handful of people it is about everyones feelings. If people started taking certain things out of there book stores libraries it would eventually get out of hand. The reason it would get out of hand is because a certain topic like slavery if someone wanted to learn about it or enjoyed reading topics like that it wouldnt be fair because @CAPS1 @CAPS2 people might find it offensive to put stuff out there for the public like that.     Everyone has their own opinion but why express your own opinion if the subject you want to express it under isn't harming anyone physically or emotionally. If everyones opinion was heard and taken into consideration tghe world as we know it would be boring and outragous. People like action and adventures, others like laid back kind of stuff. Why take things from people that they have had for a very long time if its just going to start a conflict and change the way people live everyday life. Maybe it could turn out in a good way but really what are the chances of that @NUM1 billion to a thousand.                           Things that are offensive to some people are very interesting to others so keep everything on the shelves. If only certain people are going to complain about it its not really a big deal. Maybe someday when everyone in the world agrees on @NUM2 reasoning then we could change it but i really dont see that happening anytime soon. The main reason is there is always going to be conflict between @NUM3 or more groups of people. Everyone cant be happy at the same time i say who cares weather something offends someone or not thats their opionion and until alot more people are seeing it and can stay on the shelf for the people that actually enjoy that kind of stuff."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4280	2	"Books? Movies? Music? Magazines? We all like to read them, watch them, and listen to them. @CAPS2's hard to stop all that. Plus, @CAPS2's impossible to stop. Everywhere you go you can find these items. Such as the movie store, the mall, a gas station, a yard sale, and even your public library. People of all ages can go anywhere and get a book, movie, a @CAPS1, or a magazine and @CAPS2's perfectly fine. But, there is one problem. Censorship.     Yes that's what i said, 'censorship.' @CAPS2 means alot to some parents when @CAPS2 comes to their children. Espescially when @CAPS2 comes to the public library where they live. If a parent wants to take their kids to the library and get some books or movies or ect. that's okay but if a parent has to worry about a movie or magazine has 'bad things' in @CAPS2 that children shouldn't see is a problem. They want to be able to enjoy the movie or @CAPS1 or magazine with their children but bad things like nudity, violence, racial pictures, or profanity can be really offensive to parents AND people alone, just not parents. A lot of these examples can be offensive to anyone or everyone and censorship is a pretty good idea. There is no way if I was a parent that I would want my kids to look at or watch or read any 'bad things' because we all know that is not right. Kids are young and don't need to be learning about that stuff at a young age.      I think censoring is a really great idea and I think Libraries and other places that have books, movies, music, magazines, ect. should censorize there things. But if they wont censorize anything they should at least put them in catagories such as 'adults' or 'young adults' or 'kids'. If they catagorize the ratings then the parents and you know where to look for and don't have to worry about censorship. Censorship should be practiced everywhere."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4287	2	"A library is safe haven. A place people can go to escape the world and stick their head into a book. It is a place filled with knowledge and information. You can find information on anything in a library, from any point of view. Information in libraries should not be censored, even if the information is considered offensive.     A library should not be biased. Removing certain information from a library would be biased to whatever group believes in that knowledge. Whether or not something is offensive, the information should be out there for one to learn about if he chooses. Having information in a library that @MONTH1 be offensive does not mean a person is oblidged to read it. Katherine Paterson brings up a good point when she says, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...and you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. If everyone could remove a book that offended them, there would be no books left.      There are many different views on many different subjects and everyone should have the opportunity to be educated on others' points of views. For example, there are many different religions in the world. Many of the religions have very conflicting points of views and some of their view points @MONTH1 offend each other. That does not mean that we should not provide information on different world religions simply because a person from another religion @MONTH1 be offended. Every person that goes to a library should have the right to educate themselves on others' religions. If we censored all the books that offended people, we would live in a very uneducated world.     A library is a place of education and learning. It is a place one can go and learn about any subject he chooses. If libraries censored information, then it would no longer be a place that is unbiased. It would hold a sway to a certain group of people and therefore, no longer be a safe haven for all to go and escape the world. One could not go to a library and get different points of views on every subject. Censorship on books and other materials in libraries would be a very negative thing."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4294	2	"Freedom of speech and the freedom of press is a privelige we as @CAPS1 are lucky to have. I don't believe in censorship in libraries. Authors, publishers, editors, and directors all have a right to express their opinions in their work. If they would like to express some adult subjects in their work that is their choice. They have a right as people to protray their books, magazeines, and movies anyway they want.      We all have the choice to what books and movies we want to check out at libraries. Movies are required to have ratings so the audience knows the extent of the maturity you must have to watch the film. For example if you are a @NUM1 year old who wants to checkout a movie but, it's rated @CAPS2 that is not the best choice of movie. It @MONTH1 not be the best choice because movies rated @CAPS2 let the audience know its for a mature audience over the age of @NUM2.      As for books, I often use a book review website that allows me to see the content the book has. If I see that the book contains material I don't wish to read about or think the material is too mature, I don't read it. I hold the power to choose the books I read and the responsibility to choose the books best suited for my age and maturity level.      There are many ways we can track the content of the things we can checkout. Just because a movie or book is released doesn't mean we have to watch or read it. We all make choices in our everyday lives.Some are big and some are small. Picking a book or film to checkout from a library is a small choice, but it is our choice to choose what we can handle.      Author's, directors, and editors should not have their work punished if some people don't agree with the content they are putting in their material. Everyone's opinion varies on what's right and wrong. Therefore if you believe something is inappropriate you have the chocie of not reading or watching it.      I do believe we are lucky to have this freedom of opinion and speech. Although we shouldn't abuse it we must not forget we have no right to tell others how to use this freedom. As we have the choice to read what we want to, authors have a choice on what they want to write about. Libraries shouldn't take away this freedom that allows us to make our own decisions on what we view or read"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4297	2	"Libraries     Do you go to libraries? Many people all over go to libraries for many different reasons. Sometimes when you go there, you have to have a reason to be there. You also have to be very quite. Libraries are very interesting in many ways.     Some @MONTH1 ask what a library is, well they are good places to go. People can go there for many different things. Most of the time, when people go to a library, they go to get books. Not only can you get books from there, but also go there for school tutouring, for a place to read, and just to go somewhere quite. See libraries have many things to do.     Why do people go to libraries? Well I personally do not go to a library but many others do. People that like to read go there to get a kind of book they want. I would go there for totouring for school, I honestly need it. It helps you alot and gets your homework done. My mother goes there on some occasions, like, to get information from a book or a computer. They have alot of information they you can look for. Then there are online geeks, who like to get online for video games. I get on the internet but not for video games. There is another reason why people go to the library.     My little sister loves going to the library. She is only eight years old. Why am I telling you this? Well when you go into a library, you can not get a book if you are under age. In that case, you have to have parents permission to be able to get one, but not only that, you have to have a library card in order to get a book. I no, stupid rules right? SO then again you have to have parents permission for that to! Well after the permission is all said and done, when you go to get a book, you have to make sure it's you own grade level. I have to watch that with my sister all the time because if not, then they will yell at you. I personally think that is good for most kids. So now you know that libraries are very strict.          Now that I told you all about libraries, I hope you learned something from it. Remember that they are very good places to go to for information, to get books, or just to go somewhere quite. You can always find a library around, there are NO @CAPS1! Well if you don't like to read or be quite, then you shouldn't go. I'm going to leave that to yourself."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4303	2	"Reading is very popular. It is something to do when you are sitting at home and also when you are in the classroom. School libraries are filled with defferent varieties of books and magazines and such. Some of these books could be arguably offensive to some people. These books should not be taken away from the library shelves.      There are some books that some people find so offensive that they can not even continue to read the rest of the book. Whether it be sexual or even political, if the reader finds it offensive they will not read the rest of the book. There are books out there that describe in detail sexual scenes and many parents do not want their kids to read these kinds of books. This is no reason to remove the books from the library shelves. It @MONTH1 be offensive to certain people but if you took it off of the shelves it would not be available for others to read who can handle that kind of story. Parents' kids should simply not read these books. Libraries can not take the books away all together from readers who enjoy these kinds of books.           There are also books about politics. Majority of people stand firm with politics and do not budge when it comes to discussing what they believe is right or true. When a reader comes across a book that is against the way they see politics, there can be a real problem. With politics being a serious matter, many people can overreact when someone tells them what they believe and think is true is really not. Politicians themselves especially. Still, many authors write about political matters and some books can educate the reader about points that they have not yet seen before. If a reader does not agree with what the author is writing or they find it offensive, they should not read the book. There are plenty of other readers out there that would like to read that book and to learn more about politics. If a reader knows that this kind of reading offends them, then they should know better than to pick up the book in the first place.      Many libraries offer music, movies and magazines to check out and to take home. It is true that many of these movies or the lyrics in the songs could strike someone as offensive. For this reason, they should not check them out. Many people enjoy music or movies that have offensive language. It is something that adds to the song or movie. People know their limits and if they know the contents then they should stay away. As long as there are other readers and people who like those kinds of books and music then they should keep them on the shelf. Taking them away would only take away from the number of people who visit the library. You could go to your local library and find people looking through the music section, and the music section is the only reason they come to the library in the first place. The music and movie section should stay in libraries. The people that are checking them out should be mature and responsible enough to know if they find the contents offensive.          Libraries should not take certain books, movies, and magazines away that some people find offensive. Some books and music do have contents that are offensive to some readers and viewers. However, if it is offensive to the first person, it does not mean it will be offensive to the next. The libraries need to keep these sections in their libraries for all different kinds of readers. Reading is an extremely popular activity. Readers want a variety of books, music and movies to choose from."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4316	2	"I do not think people should take books off the shelves because the town libraries have those types of books. People should enjoy reading all types of books. Some people only read different books. Little kids like fantasy and picture books, teenagers like romance, and others like nonfiction. It should not matter what other people think.     If people brought books off the shelves then what will the other people read. Before you bring books off the shelves, you should ask and write down what other people like instead of doing what you think is right. Think about what would happen if u brought down books off the shelves. What would happen? I will tell you, you would lose customers.     If you don't want children to read inappropriate books, then you should make a card saying that your parents give them permition to read those books. If that won't work, then make an age limit. Have the parents show you their berth certificate. Have a resticted section in the library. In order to get a book from the resticted section, then have a parent sign a note saying that their allowed.     Children the age of thirteen and under should not be given magazines. If their the age of fourteen and up, then they can get a magazine. Music should not matter to parents, so there should be no problem there. If the movies are bought by the parents, then there should be no problem there either. The other things you can figure it out on your own.     This is what I think should happen to books in a library. I told you how a library should work. I told you what I thought should go on in the library. I will give you some advise. Think before you do. That is all I am going to tell you."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4318	2	"Books, magazines, movies, and music are created with a huge diversity. Fiction, @ORGANIZATION1, horror, fashion, sciencefiction, and many more categories of literature are made. There is something out there everyone will enjoy. What would you do if you did not have the choice to read, listen to, or watch the materials you like because someone else had an ill opinion of it?     Everyone has an opinion. It @MONTH1 be in favor of something or it @MONTH1 not be. I believe every book, movie, magazine, and other piece of literature should have a rightful place on the shelf. To some people it @MONTH1 be offensive, but that does not mean they have to read it. Someone @MONTH1 enjoy a piece of work  another finds offensive. It is all a matter of opinion. The opinion of one person should not effect materials being able to be on a shelf or not.      If you walked into a libraray and the shelves were filled with books, but only books everyone had a good opinion about the shelves wouldn't seem very full. It is hard to get two people to agree on the same thing. Imagine trying to get everyone to agree on the literature in a public libraray. Censorship is understandble to an extent, but I believe the libraries should organize all their literature into categories and sections. In these categoires and section people @MONTH1 look for the materials they wish to see and avoid the offensive materials they do not.      Libraries have rated @CAPS1 movies. Many people could consider rated @CAPS1 movies to be offensive, but many people could enjoy watching rated @CAPS1 movies. Who wins, the people who find then offensive or the people who enjoy them? It is a hard choice to make. I believe the libraries should carry the movies and if someone finds them offensive they should simply not watch them. The same goes for books, magazines, and music. If you find it offensive simply do not read it or listen to it.     There are hundreds of different sytles of writing, plots of movies, lyrics of songs, and covers of magazines. They have such a diversity because everyone has a different opinion of the lyrics, covers, styles, and plots. They can not censor things just because some people find them offensive. Others @MONTH1 enjoy them. What would you do if your favorite book was not allowed in your public lirbaray"	4	4		4	4	4	4

Like if you have kid's you should keep them and a kid's area. We cannot just start takeing down every book off the shelf because it was not a good book.The reason why kid's should stay and the kid's area is so they want pick up that book thats not for them. We will need the read to be reading childrens book.If a kid's pick up a bad book you should explaine to them that this book is not for them. Some books are @CAPS1 for kid's to read. so thats why they have there on area to be in. Kid's should not leave there area for a @CAPS1 book. I think that kids should list to appropiate music and a libriary.  The @CAPS1 book or materials are not for the kid's to read so they should not be and that area to pick up a bad book. i feel like there are no bad book out there if you dont like the book maybe someones elese will. but like movies, music, and magazines should not be off the shelf because if it was @CAPS1 it would not be and the libriary and the first place.

4325	2	"My name is @CAPS1 and my views on censorship in libraries are that if any material that are found offensive should be take off the shelves. I have never came across a material that was offensive to me, but maybe someone else has and it really offended them. I'm not the type of person who would start an argument but i am a type of person who will speak whats on my mind and tell you what i believe in.      People are concerned about if libraries take off certain kinds of books that their will not be books left on the shelves for anyone else. I have to say there are other places you can buy books at beside the libraries such as stores as in @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, and etc. Like i said i have never came across a book that i think should be pulled off the shelf, but of course i don't read a whole lot either but the books i have read i have never came a crossed any that were terrible.     Books that have like how people can kill themselves, or how people get pregnant, and so on, them can be pulled off the shelves, but if you have a child in the library they shouldnt even be in the adult book section anyways, they should be in the kids book section. I have never heard of a kid book that is terrible and that should be pulled off the shelf. Most authors are smarter then that, or at least i would hope so.      Music is a whole story its self. In my opinon if you don't want your kids to listen to adult music then don't let them. I know a lot of music that is bad and that i would never let my children listen to it but i know well enough if i don't want them to listen to it them i'm not going to play it while their around. I grew up around rap music so thats all i listen to, but when i have kids i know what they will be able to listen to and what they wont be able to listen to.      Movies is the one that i have a problem with the most because in libraries, and other places such as, @ORGANIZATION1, and book stores they just put out movies for EVERYONE to see and it doesn't matter what's on the cover or what it's called. Now movies with bad covers and bad titles could be pulled off the shelves such as all the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' movies. The name of the movies aren't bad but the movie its self is not for a child to see so why even have it out on shelves for kids to see and want to watch it?      Magazines and etc i don't have a big problem with because libraries don't have bad ones, but book stores do such as 'playboy and play girl' but they are usually put back in the very back behind all other magazines so children can't see them only adults can. The only way a child would see them is only if you point them out.      I think i've said all i can say about my opinions and my experiences about books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries that should or shouldn't be pulled off the shelves. I havn't had a lot of experience but maybe that's because i don't have kids yet, i guess i will find out when i do have kids. I happy to explain my experiences and opinions to people who really care and want to know"	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
4333	2	"Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I do not think it should matter weather we have music, movies or magazines in the library. Some people like to come in the library to relax and look at a magazine or listen to some music.      I do not think it bothers anybody by what other people are doing there, if it is not bothering them it should not bother anybody else. I see people sometimes reading a book and listening to music. it does not bother me when they do this. It is a way for them to drown out the world and enjoy a good book.     There is only one reason why we should keep certain materials out of the library. It is that some people get very loud when there looking at magazines, or when there music is turned up way to loud. Other than that I do not think we should keep those types of materials in the librarys.      I am a reader my self and I like to read in peace. So I like to listen to my music while I am reading. I also like to read magazines every once and awhile. It is real relaxing to me.     Those are my reasons on why it should not matter weather we have those types of materials in the library"	3	3		3	3	4	3																		
4337	2	"Censoring @CAPS1     We all know that language is the foundation of human legacy.  Language is spoken to mean anything the speaker is trying to communicate.  To take books from the shelves is to steal the words from the mouths of many great speakers.  We have the obligation to keep the @CAPS1 that we have created alive.  If something is forgotten, it is as if nothing happened. If nothing happened, it will reoccur- good or bad.     To hide away words from our children is wrong.  If not by word of print, word of mouth will lead them to the same discoveries as they would have come to if reading it from a book.  But even more importantly, what good is hiding the truth?  When many speak of tragic incidences, they speak, '@CAPS2 forget.'  If we should not forget, why should the youth @CAPS2 learn?  There is nothing in print that can not be conveyed in a different communication form.     Our @CAPS1 is written on the pages of literature.  The books we read are the property of all humanity and should be read by all to educate us of our mistakes as well as our triumphs.  A commonly debated topic in the world of censorship is 'The @CAPS3 of @CAPS4 @CAPS5.'  @CAPS6 is a novel that displays what life was truly like in one of @LOCATION1's most racially barbaric times.  One might argue the fact that it uses an offensive 'n' word more than a few times.  To @CAPS6 one might argue that @PERSON3, the @CAPS7 @CAPS8 that stood by @PERSON2 was loved by @PERSON2.  A book in @CAPS6 time displaying a friendship between a black and a white man is truly a ground breaking feat.  The 'n' word was common place in @CAPS6 time period- a friendship between a black man and a white man was not.  Is it really important that a child knows of just another offensive word that they are bound to discover eventually anyway, or is it more important that they learn that color of skin does not change a person?  Do not take the opportunity for a child to learn what really matters away.     To take one book away is to take all of them away.  Censoring one piece of literature opens the doors of debate for every other piece ever created.  The world has seen what can happen when things get censored.  During @PERSON1's dictatorship, nearly everything from the internet, to books, to newspwpers, to television programming, to movies, to music, to magazines were censored so only what the dictatorship wanted got through.  The people were brainwashed, and those who were not rose up, and when they did they were shot down.  Do not let the world come to that.  We are better than that and our literature shows it.     In other words, to censor media and the literature that surrounds us, we deprive ourselves of education and freedoms that are critical to the well being of future generations.  Do not hide the free speech of authors, do not hide our @CAPS1 from our children, do not let us make the same mistake that has been made before.  Let us educate our children for the future of humanity.  Let our @CAPS1 not repeat itself. Let us innovate and create a new, better world.  Let us allow our words to flow freely.  Let us allow our legacy to live on."	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
4348	2	"I disagree with library censorship. Every person should be allowed to produce their reflection of their believes or ideas. If certian books found offensive were to be removed from libraries then there would be nothing left for anyone to read.     If parents are concerned with what their children are checking out from the library to read then they should read it before their child to see if they think it is appropriate. In my opinion children should be able to read what ever they like and by doing that they can teach themselves many things.     Books can also help children to escape from every day life.Admitedly, children should not always escape, or use reading to hide from real life, but occasionaly they need too. I know as a young child when things were not going so well I could always turn to reading to get my mind off of the bad things. If children are allowed these escapes they can do better on their school work and with their peers.     Reading can help a child to expand their imaginations. If a child reads a couple times a day it is proven that said child will do better in life. No one likes boring people, and how can you be boring with such a wide imagination?  It is impossible!     In recent online polls, parents who's children can access books say that their children to better in school and in every day life. By reading, these children can easily expand their vocabularies. With this knowlege they can learn with less difficulty and can excell in acedemics with ease.     In conclusion, If certian books are censored from the libraries they will be inavailable for children to read. Children need books to provide an escape, to expand their imaginations, and to help them in school and life. Do not let libraries censor books!"	3	4		3	4	4	4

4373	2	"Throughout time, fellow people have struggled to censor or ban material that they consider offensive. It @MONTH1 be the way they were brought up, or simply what they beleive. I do not beleive that it should be up to anyone to say what should and should not be censored for anyone but themselves. Everyone has one life, and in this one life we create our personal oppinions and beliefs on what is wrong and what is right. We are completely unaware of many people throughout our life cycles, and saying what should be banned from everybody is almost claiming you know the morals, beliefs, and customs of everyone in the world.     If I came to school one day and brought a book that contained material that I think is relevant and not just pure exploitation, then I should be able to read that as long as I don't influence others by their own will. Let's say another student sees me reading that same book and he has grown up in a household that taught him that the situations and material in my book are overly offensive, I do not think he should be able to create a ban of this book just because of his own upbringing. There is such a thing as mass agreement, but there is also a thing called mass ignorance, and to say that I know what should and should not be shown to other people is completely ignorant on my part.      I think the only allowance of censorship should be from parent to child. That is the only situation that someone should be allowed authority over someone else, because they have undeniable duties as parents, and they be able to say what is right knowing they are creating a child to think what is wrong and what is right in their mind"	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
4379	2	"There is many different topics that could be offensive, @CAPS5 just depends on the person's own personal judgement. In my opinion I do not believe that materials should be removed because not everyone has the same view or opinons. If someone comes from a different country or evern a different religion, topics like abortion and racism are going to be viewed very differently. I think having a variety of topics will help expand different thoughts and make the readers of the material see things in a different way.      When I am older and if one of my elementary children was to bring home a book over abortion, I would be concerned. Honestly though, I do not believe schools would let inapropriate topics for younger childeren read books like that. @CAPS5 is a little bit different with a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 student though. Their maturity level is going to be mature enough to handle the material and I do not think @CAPS5 is right for schools to remove something that could actually help someone.      In the book, 'A @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5', there is a lot of detailed events that happen. Some might say @CAPS5 is too graphic for children but the reality of @CAPS5 is, events like those happen in today's society. @CAPS5 really opened up my eyes and I am extremely happy I read @CAPS5. The realization actually made me want to help those children who grow up in homes like the one described in the book. I believe @CAPS5 had the same effect on other people too and some children might even grow up to help others in that horrible situation.      Libraries should be able to have a variety of different books. I am not saying however that they should have books on murder and saying @CAPS5 is alright but books that will help expand the children's minds. @CAPS5 could even change their lives. Some books are a sensitvie topic but who has the right to tell someone something they should believe? @CAPS5 would mean more to someone if they found their own way and beliefs then having people tell them what they should and should not do or believe in.      I have also read a book recently titled, '@CAPS6', @CAPS5 is about the government granting the ability to @CAPS6 your children and then the body parts will go to those in need. @CAPS5 is sort of cruel in one way but the topic the author is trying to get across is not. A quote from the book is, 'On one side you have people killing abortion doctors for the right of life and on the other you have people getting pregnant just to sell their fetal tissue'. @CAPS5 states that everywhere you go people are going to disagree and agree on things but not everyone will believe in the same thing. @CAPS5 shows that just because one person thinks one way is right does not mean another will. The book changed my perspective on many different topics and helped me open my eyes on different views.      Racism, abortion, @CAPS3 abuse, unwinding your children, what ever the case @MONTH1 be, some people will support @CAPS5 and some will not. I think @CAPS5 is time for children around the world to discover for themselves what they truely believe in and taking 'offensive' material from @CAPS2 libraries is not going to help any. My opinion on this topic is strongly advising to leave the material alone because for there to be a book about @CAPS5, the author had to have had a reason to write @CAPS5 and honestly, what is better for the future then a generation of children grounded to their own true beliefs"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4386	2	"I believe that if you let people take stuff off of the shelves that they didn't like then there would be nothing left. I thank this because there are a lot of parents that don't want their little kids to be seeing it or hearing it. That is because they could get infulenced to do the wrong thang and get themselves in truble for it. Then you have some parents that don't care what their kids are doing as long as they are leving them alone. Then you have some other that are very over procted.      Yes, I think that there are something that should be taken off shelves because they are very interpreit. They are because they are talking a drugs and alchole and trying to get young kids to try it and get addicated to it. That why they can get more money from it and those kids end up geting heard or died from it. All some of thies bussinesses are trying to do is get money from the young because they make to bottles or cantaners look cool. Most of the time you will have kids go for it but there are some kids that don't because they don't want to get in truble or heart themsleves.           There are some songs that should not be alowed to be played because of some of the stuff that they say. There are some people and some parents that listen to it and with there kids in the car then their kid will go to school and be sing it and get in truble for it. I think that their are a lot of thang that should be different but they are not because the bussinesses are just happy that they are geting money. They don't care how is buying it as long as they get there money for it and that is not the wright way to look at it you should care about the lives of people and their familys.            Then you have some magazines that have some uniperate pitchers in them. They do because they are trying to get guys to buy them just for that one pitcher that is in it. They want it because its a very pritty girl with just a bathing suite on or maybe nothing on. That is why they put it in there so they can get their money off of it. Most of the girls that are in them are modles and they are very pritty, but sometime there will be a little boy that takes his dad and then he takes it to school and get in truble for it. Then his partens are enbeist because they didn't know that he had.           That is why I thank that some stuff should be not on the shelves in stores. You will have partens that get it tten leave it laying out and their kids will get in then might take it to school. You should never leave anything that you don't want your kids to have laying out for them to get. That is why I believe that and what I thank about it"	3	3		3	2	2	2																		
4401	2	"Censorship, or the ability to control what is seen or heard, is a term that is taken very differently from one person to the next. Music, if it is found offensive or inappropriate, can be consored or even banned from listening. Some magazines that are found at grocery stores, libraries, and sometimes even airports, have @ORGANIZATION1 covers on the front to visually censor the front page of the magazine. Movies are given ratings based on their level of explicit material, and when shown on basic cable, they sometimes can have either silenced words, or more appropriate words brought in to fit the dialougue in the movie. Books, although very rarely, have been banned from libraries and censored from the entire world. Some books have been previously censored, but became uncensored and brought back to libraries. In my opinion, censorship should not be based on a single person's view of the material, but rather on the viewpoint of the public. Growing up, my parents would watch carefully about what shows I watched, what music I listened to, or the types of magazines that i looked at.     When I was growing up, I loved to watch professional wrestling. I loved to watch big scary guys as tall as seven feet hitting each other with steel chairs, crashing each other into tables, or throwing each other off of twenty-foot steel cages. My brother and I used to have a favorite wrestler that we would for every week, @PERSON1 @CAPS1 could freighten any other wrestler who stood in his way. My brother and I loved to watch @PERSON1 @CAPS1 compete every week for a chance at a world chamionship belt. As time passed, professional wrestling began to welcome in beautiful women into their business. These women would come out onto the ring with tight, shiny, lingerie on as they became eye-candy for the men who watched professional wrestling. One day, I'm watching two girls fighting in a match when my mom walks in. She takes one look at the half-naked girls fighting each other and turns off the @CAPS3 and declares that professional wrestling is too adult for me. Even though I was twelve at the time, I didn't want to get in an argument with my mom about how much I should be allowed to see. Censorship can be based on the ideas and viewpoints of the parents and guardians.     I was in grade school when I fell in love with the show, '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6.' @CAPS7 is a show about four boys who go on unintentional adventures to save their @CAPS4 @CAPS5. These four boys, who are all around eleven years old, use curse words that some adults would be afraid to use in every day life. Their behavior is very controversial and the show itself has been forced to ban a few of their episodes for safety reasons. One problem with @CAPS7 show was that my dad loved @CAPS7 show as well, and tried to get my mom to like the show. When my mom saw the show, she immediately banned me from watching it because of its explicit content. Now that I am older, I am able to make my own decisions about what I watch, but as a kid, my parents decided what was appropriate for me.     I grew up listening to several different types of music. My brother listened to rap, alternative, and even songs that were in musicals because he was in show choir. My dad introduced me to classic rock, and my mom loved soft rock. Although I didn't necessarily like the music that my mom liked, I learned to love my dad's music and my brother's music. I loved to listen to music from artists like @ORGANIZATION4, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS8, @CAPS9, and so on. My musical tastes branched out into a variety of different genres. One day, I'm walking in the hallway when I hear some music coming from the living room. I go to see what is playing because it sounds unfamiliar. My dad and my brother told me to go into another room and not listen to the music. The song was by a band named @ORGANIZATION2. Even though it might seem unfair, censorship, given by the parents and guardians, is very necessary.     Although some people might find a certain piece of material offensive, it doesn't mean that the entire world should be banned from the material itself. If that person wants to keep away from the material and keep their kids from seeing or listening to that material, they are able to do that. Censorship, given by the parents or guardians, is the best way to view censorship. Nothing should be banned from a library, music store, or any other place that sells these materials. Censorship is important, but the entire banning of a certain piece of material is unjust."	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
4404	2	"Tuff @CAPS1 for a little @CAPS2      Censorship is a problem we are faced with today. I believe there are certain instances where censorship is necessary, but I also feel it must be kept in check. Thats why i have a great deal of reespect for organizations and industries that try and stop or put of censorship media untill your more mature and responsible enough to handle it.         The most common categories where censorship is not all right in my world are, books and music. A lot of book are very well writen and fabulous to read, but in history or racial, and more cultural books they use words/terms that are offensive to me and a lot of other people to.      Also, the main cause in thius is music. In today's society, nearly every person has an ipod and downloaded onto that ipod is music. Im not saying all music is terribly bad, but in most cases i hear about every word in the book and race topics. Rappers are setting bad examples for young adolecents like myself, who pose with guns and have marijuna and crack. Why do they do this? Just to mkae themselves more popular. That is hurting our education and making us think we shyould be criminals.      I in my opinion enjoy magazines and tru informative facts from professional reporters. Tghe reporters are on the citizens side and trying to get the true facts out there for us the people. Maqgazines also, tell about annual celbrations and good things happening in the world. Whyere you can find out the scores of sports game and what the weather is going to be like.      Last year, i remeber reading 'To @CAPS3 a @CAPS4'. It was so contraversial and talked about blackl slaves and whites treatinbg them like dirt. Also, about black never win a trial and there treated unfairly. I felt embaressed and i was the only african american in the class. It was akward. I felt like if we had a discussion people would talk badly about iot then remember i was in the room then theyd stop.     What is the world going to do? Censorship covers an entire multi media spectrum of what is bad and good censorship. It is up to the right people to stand up for what is right and wrong for your children and young adolecents in the world. To help fight this cause! Bring down all that is bad! We can do it, we will fight! Like @PERSON1 says, 'dont hope for a better change or wish for a new world.' If you want change you need to make it happen and stand up for whats right and make a differnce in the world"	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
4406	2	"Often we go to the library searching for a good book or magazine to read without actually knowing what books are available. In order to find a book that interests you, you have to explore by picking up the book and looking at the cover and reading its background. Sometimes we come across a book or magazine that is innapropriete for children, and wonder why that book is still on the shelf for anyone to pick up. I believe materials that are offensive to some people should be permitted from the public library.     To begin, the books selected to advertise on the shelves of a library are not restricted for a certain age level. Libraries are broken up into different sections on where to find a genre, but a young child @MONTH1 not be aware. I believe they're certain materials found in a library that should not be put out for the public. Perhaps you have a five year old child pick up a book about sex and drugs, this could lead the child to learn things they shouldn't know until they are older.      To continue, offensive books should not be put into libraries because they give that library a bad reputation. If someone were to come from out of town and the first thing they seen on the shelves of a library was a book with a naked body or drugs, they would immediately be taken back. Offensive types of books can include books you wouldn't want a first grader to see and also books about racial or religion. Certain people would take offense to a book that was against what they believed in. This could result in a huge confrontation.      Lastly, offensive books can include books about someone's opinion on a certain topic. If someone against the writer's opinion started to read the book, they would automatically be offended by what the writer was saying. There is never an agreement when two people have a different look on something.      To conclude, although some books are offensive to some people and not to others, we have to be aware of what @MONTH1 cause problems to certain people. I believe any book open about opinion, and books that would be 'x-rated' should not be kept in a public library. We could easily solve this problem by making a seperate place to hold these books so people will not take offense to it."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4415	2	"Should certain materials in libraries be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? I do not think books or any other materials should be taken off the shelves for some people? There are many reasons that the books should stay on the shelves. I am going to tell you all of the reasons I think the books should stay on the shelves.     One reason I think the books should stay on the shelves is because some people might need the books for a school project. For example, a student could have a project over @CAPS1. A book on @CAPS1 could offend many people. Just because it offends some people does not mean it should be taken off the shelf because other people might need that book. Someone might need a certain book for a project. If the one book they need is taken off a shelf because it offended someone they could fail a class. That is one reason I think the books should stay on the shelves.     Another reason I think they should stay on the shelves it's their opinion if the book offends them. Just because they don't like the book and it offends them doesn't mean other people do not want to read it. Why would you take a book off of a shelf because it offends one or a couple people? There could be many more people who want to check out that book and read it.     If a book offends you just dont look at it. Why would you look at something that offends you? I don't understand why libraries would have to removed a book from the shelf just because it offends someone. Especially, when that person could just ignore the book and pay no attention to it. That is my last reason my opinion is what it is.     So after reading this I hope you understand why my opinion is what it is. There is no point in taking books off the shelves. People need them for research and projects. It is someones opinion if they do not like what the book is about and if it offends them. For example, if i didn't like something on a menu at a resteraunt they are not going to take it off the menu for me. My last reason the books should stay on the shelves is the people can just ignore the books and not look at them that would be easier than taking books off the shelves.                                    THE @CAPS3"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4417	2	"In our society today there is an enormous amount of exposure to materials that many adults didn't have when they were a child. Young children today see drugs, alcohol, sex, and teen pregnancy portrayed as things a normal child's everyday life consists of. Certain television shows, books, and even some popular songs condone these behaviors that many @CAPS1 are opposed to. While libraries @MONTH1 seem to be the most unusual place to have access to these materials, many young children can checkout books that are simply not appropriate for their age. Censorship of materials, such as books, movies, and music, that are found offensive or inappropriate are a way to teach young children that life isn't all about what the media portrayes it to be.     One very important reason to allow censorship of materials in libraries is that you might not know what type of book you're looking at. Many children, and adults too, walk into the library and look among the books until they see a cover or a title that grabs their attention. While most of the books in a library are age appropriate a child can still grab a book that isn't something they should be reading. There are mass amounts of influential materials from the media and also from peers that a child is subject to. Censorship in a library will make it a safer place for children to go and pick up any book in the proper section for them and will also allow the @CAPS1 to not have to worry about what their child has selected. As author Katherine Paterson so rightly said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 should never have to worry about what their child can get ahold of in a public library.     A second reason to allow censorship in libraries is that video stores already have censorship in their shops, along with ratings on all their movies and video games. Most video stores have a seperate section of movies that are deemed to have 'adult content' in them. A minor cannot walk into a movie store and go to the section of movies deemed for adults, or someone over the age of eighteen. A minor can't rent an @CAPS2-rated movie without proving that they are seventeen, or they have an adult to rent it for them. The same thing occurs with video games, for example a video game with a rating of @CAPS3, or mature, cannot be rented or bought by anyone under the age of eighteen. @CAPS5 censorship should be applied to libraries. Having seperate sections based on adult content allow movies and books to be set in a seperate location so that no child can possibly rent something that they have no intention of watching or reading. @CAPS5 type of censorship also allows for a parent to choose if their child can see it. An example of @CAPS5 would be for a sixteen year old boy. While he cannot go and rent the @CAPS2-rated movie, if his @CAPS1 deem it acceptable for him to see, then they can rent it for him. @CAPS5 gives the parent control of what their child sees, instead of the child having full control. @CAPS5 same type of censorship that video stores have is a perfect way to place censorship in a library.     Perhaps the most important reason for censorship in libraries is the early exposure the materials give to the children. Many young children have been watching television shows or hearing things on the news that make it seem acceptable in our society to drink at parties when you're not of age, do illegal drugs for the feeling, and have sex at an extremely young age because it's what 'everyone's doing.' @CAPS5 is a very risky path to let the young children in our society take. Allowing our culture to become @CAPS5 way can lead to various sorts of problems, as we have seen all to well. Many young kids, some as young as fourteen or fifteen years old, go to parties and drink. When it comes to getting a ride home they go with their seventeen-year-old friend who has a license, and who has also been drinking at the party. Now hopefully the story ends that all of the children make it home safely, but that is not how it works in many cases. There have been so many drunk driving crashes recently in our nation with children who should not have even been drinking. @CAPS5 ties back to censorship because of the way these kids were pressured into drinking. Many adults in the society blame it on peer pressure; but where do the peers get the idea that @CAPS5 is acceptable? These ideas come from the influences that the society's children are susceptable to. Censorship in libraries is one way of restricting the ideas children are exposed to, and hopefully allowing them lead safer and healtheir lives. While there are so many other factors in the exposure to children of these materials, stopping the exposure in libraries is one way of eradicating early exposure. Young children in today's society and culture are exposed to excessive amounts of inappropriate materials.     These three factors, the inability to know what you might be checking out at the library, the fact that video stores already have censorship, and the unecessary exposure to young children, all lead to the need for censorship in libraries. Today's society is all about the freedom to allow anything to happen than is acceptable. While some @MONTH1 see these books or movies as their own freedom to speech the truth is that it is harming the society, hence the need for censorship in libraries and other places where children have access to movies, books, magazines, music, and video games. Removing the offensive books, magazines, and movies from shelves in libraries around the country will lead to a safer culture for children to grow up in, and a society where things such as drugs, alcohol, and sex aren't condoned near as often"	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
4418	2	"Library books offensive? The right to remove a book or not isn't up to us ,people, per our opinions. If someone has an issue with the book; next time don't get it. I know that we shouldn't have the right to remove books from the librarys. It's not up to us to make that choice.     I know people sometimes find somethings wrong or inappropriate in a book at the librarys', but if it wasn't to your liking don't read the rest of it or refer it to a friend. I have had problems with this before. I went to check out a book and my mom said that she didn't like the topic that it was about: honestly its her opinion. A person should have a right to his/her opinions but it shouldn't affect someone elses. One person @MONTH1 really like the book and someone else @MONTH1 hate it, obviously their are people out there who enjoy that type of book so there isn't a really good reason to get rid of it. The only person who should have a say in getting rid of a book would have to be the librarian. That person knows what is acceptable and what isn't for the library. If it includes something graphic or racist, you can talk to them about it in a clam conversation, because they maybe a librarian but they dont read every single book that is in the library.      Some items can be offensive to some but not others. The library is there for knowledge and entertainment. We can have opinions on matters and discuss them appropriately without causing a big ordeal  because their could be reasons why things are where they are. You need to leave the choice up to the person who is educated on the matter/ who is in charge of the library"	3	3		3	3	4	3																		
4423	2	"I think what ever is offensive should be taken off of the shelf because it is inoproperate. Books do not need to be like that because they are supposed to be fun for you and help you learn, yes you can have a little violence in an action/adventure book to get the mood of the character, setting of the story, and to understand it perhaps.     Offensive books can be okay at times, so if you have a comedy magazine, or book that is making fun of something or someone, it can be taken in a offensive way, or just a joke, and a none offensive way.     To most people they are going to want to take those kinds of books off of the shelf. Offensive books to them, such as parents or maybe even friends, they can teach a child wrong, and that child @MONTH1 not learn the right way. Kids when they are little, their brains are like sponges, so they learn, and remember stuff well at that age. A child getting a hold of a book or being tought something from a book like that will most likley remember it.     I think those kinds of books should be taken off of the shelf because, kids dont need to be reading that kind of stuff when its allready on television, and talked about. They need the edicational books that can teach them, and prepare them for their uppcoming higher grade levels, so then they would have a fresh start on new words or grammer."	2	3		2	2	3	2																		
4425	2	"Katherine Paterson made a valid point in stating that some books are to offensive for some people to read, but that does not mean they they should not be read. Time and time throughout someone's life we hear things that we do not like nor want to be bothered with, but it is good that we do. Libraries should have to right to open all types of books to their shelves and not have them be censored by the public, this is why.      We, as people of the @CAPS1 have battled through hard times. @CAPS2, racistism, and extreme poverty or depression are just a few to recall. Having delt with those issues we alwaying tend to repeat them out of lack of knowledge. Slavery and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were some of the @CAPS1's lowest moments and they were also very gruesome. Recalling those memeries is difficult but something that needs to be done; if books were to be cencored then many young adults would not be educated and could repeat such horrible actions.      Pertaning to movies, music and magzines the same laws applies. Though not in the same way, many times these publications are written about current news or social aspects of life. Music is a form a expression and everyone has their own taste. Not having to opition to chose froma variety of styles is wrong and unfair.  Music can not only be an expression feeling about love or angry but it can also teach life lesson's. Some artist like to sing or rap on their life journey. This can educate others in to knowing that if you do this then this is the result, good or bad. In a magzine they tend to lean towards more current topics such a politics, jobs, or young adults lifestyles. Movies apply to the same rights and topics. Each on is egualily as important and if a group of citizens feel that it is not then who are they to make that call.      What gives a group of people the right to say this is inapporicate and that you should not read it? They do not have it. In the constitution is states that you have freedom of speech and that means you can express it anyway you choose. By censoring what people read that is in a way taking away that author right to speak. Now, that is unfair.      Though Katherine Paterson made a vaild point in saying that some books are to offensive to read, she just simiply is not right. A library is supposed to be a place where people can find a book, music, movie, magazine of any genre  and read it. If matericals were cencored then that is unfair to someone else who does want to read it. Bottom line is that you have free will and you have to power to choose weather or not you want to read something"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4427	2	"What do you go to the library for?  In earlier times libraries used to be the place where you went to study.  They were no computers, and so you had to go look up your work in a educational book at the library.  Is that truly what people are doing at the libraries now, or are people there to look at vulgar books, magazines, and movies?       A library is meant to be the place where you can go to work in peace and have a helpful resource of educational books.  But, now you can go to the library and be tempted to look at books you shouldn't be looking at.  Instead you could be on the computer the whole time playing games of some sort.  The possibilites are endless.  People now could go to the library and check out a magazine, movie, or book on: pornagrophy, drugs, achlocol, or worse.  Is that really what you want your kid to accidently pick up at the library?  Presonally I myself witnessed a little kid pick up a porn magazine at the library, and his mom had to grab it very fast before he had the chance to look at the magazine.     The library should not be used for this, and the treat of young kids accidently looking at these materials should not be happening in the library.  The music some one could listen is also very bad, and your child could listen to that.  Then what if they want to keep listening to it?  Yes, the world does have a huge impact on what is put into the library; because, drugs, sex, scandals, and achlocol seem to be what most teenagers are intereseted in at some point in their young life.  But a library is a community building and there is no stopping some one from coming in and easily getting these vuglar things.  The thoughts of the youth is completely swayed after they watch, read, or listen to this.  And, this needs to be controled.  Women and children can find all of these materials offensive.  These materials need to be censored more then what the are right now.     Libraries should be a safe place where people can go to study or get a book, and not to be tempted to look at something they should not be looking at.  Many people find this offensive.  Yes, in the end libraries are a great place, but the people who do not use libraries for the right reasons are why these materials need to be censored at the libraries"	3	3		3	3	4	3																		
4432	2	"Do I think that certain books, music, movies, magazines should be removed from our librarys. No i dont think they should be removed, they could be placed in another part of the library away from all the other books that aren't offensive.     If they did decide to remove these books are kids would have a hard time learning about the truth. Book publishers put only what they want are kids to learn. Most of the time they leave out bits and pecies about what really happened. So if they took the offensive books, music, movies, and magazines out, a lot of kids would just go home everyday and sit around or cause trouble. From my own experience, I enjoyed reading, listening, and watching the offensive materials they want to take out of our librarys. So if you don't like the offensive materials then don't even look at them, that will solve your problem, and teach your children that to.     Overall I think they should keep the offensive materials. If people still complain, move it to another part of the library, in seperate room or somethin of that kind. This should solve the problem of kids reading, listening, and watching these kinds of things."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4442	2	"A few months ago I was at the local library searching for the perfect book. After an hour of searching I decided on one. I was happy with my choice as I checked it out. As I anxiously started reading my book, I found language, drug abuse, and sexual content. As a teenager, I do not want or need to be exposed to any innapropriate material. No one should be exposed to that, and because of that experiance, I believe that censorship in libraries is a must.     Due to sexual content, drug abuse, and vulgar language, one must be seventeen to purchase a ticket for a rated-@CAPS1 movie. I believe that since that is true for movies, it should also be true for books, magazines, and music. @CAPS2 literature is not necessary and innapropriate for any age. The world exposes certain literature to children, and then is shocked when they see children in jails, gangs, and other horrible situations.     The world has set their standards too low, and the children of todays society are following after our footsteps. Author, Katherine Paterson once said,     '...if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right so does everyone else.' @CAPS2 quote shows the impact that people have on generations to come.     Everyone has their own opinion and @CAPS2 is mine. As a daily newspaper reader, I could not quiet my voice any longer. I had to step-up and say something. I am apart of a generation that is being affected greatly by the world in a negative way. The first step to changing that is to set the standards high. Protect the future generations and censor what children are allowed to be exposed to. Situations will become better when libraries choose to censor and remove offensive materials from shelves. If libraries censor materials, then next time I wnat to find the perfect book, I will."	4	3		4	4	4	4																		
4446	2	"No I do not believe that certain materials should not be remove from the shelves because I dont see how they are offensive to other people.       Even if its war movies its telling what these men have gone through and they fought and lost there friends. You just dont see people just killing and shooting you see the emoutions of the men and its emoution to you to see that.       Every book in there should stay there because some people need it for a project or to study about that person and a lot of books has lots of history that you can learn from.      The only thing that I think that should be remove is the music because if its rap or anything like that should not be allow in libraries, it brings hatered and often killing to the country and that should not be allowed.       Some Magazines should be allowed like raceing, sports, or military but all of the other bad stuff should stay out because if they do see, the kind of stuff that shouldnt be seen it will get into there mind. Thats what I think about this whole idea"	3	2		3	3	3	3																		
4466	2	"I think that only if there is real offensive stuff then it should be censored.  It is wrong to make fun of or joke about people. Mocking a dissability like there have been  movies made doing. Well actually, there is a movie I've seen before called The @CAPS1 and its a guy that made fun of a special olympic team, then lied about having a dissability to get money for racing and beating the team in races when he was totally fine.That would be something that I myself would want to take off shelves because there is no reason to mock a dissability.  I wouldn't know who decides what goes on shelves and what does not so maybe depending on what the offensive information is tells them something shouldnt be brought out"	2	2		2	3	3	3																		
4474	2	"Should we have censorship in our libraries?  This is a question that both sides can argue with creditable facts.  However, censhorship is mostly defined as not allowing certain items or things to be seen or heard of until a mature age.  How can you tell when someone is of a mature age?  Maturity lies behind one's self to cope with various thoughts, ideas, actions, etc.  Censorship should be allowed to an extent.     Censhorship plays a big role in society today.  It has changed the content on our television from @NUM1 years ago to modern day.  The government is more leniant today then they were @NUM1 years ago.  On television @NUM1 years ago, you would never hear a sware word, or see a couple sleep in the same bed.  Now, some sware words are considered okay, because people can handle them.  It is like they are part of our daily vocabulary now.  Censorship has changed a lot.     Books of all sorts should be allowed to children and adults of all ages.  Certain literature provides a cornucopia of topics and subjects to be helpful to a processing brain.  We learn and understand at different rates.  Some books with 'adult content' @MONTH1 be suitable for more intelligent minds.  Authors sometimes put in so-called 'adult content' to add suspense and drama towards the bigger picture or message behind their work.  Books help the mind to expand and gain a higher standard of learning.     Movies are differnent.  Some movies have sexual content that our youth should not see.  Most magazines have the same principles as movies do.  They are both rated differently on levels of age.  Therefore, we can protect their innocence and fellow youth.  Music is healthy to the mood of a person.  Music should not be censored.  People just have different tastes in music.  Some @MONTH1 be fond of other genres and some @MONTH1 dislike the other genres.  There is a wide array of music that people can enjoy.  There is no way to censor the universal language that music provides.     Censorship should come down to what the adult allows for the kid to see and hear.  Censorship of books is not fine, but censorship of movies and magazines are acceptable.  Music, however, can not be censored.  The lyrics and sounds speak to many people in strange ways.  It is all helpful in the end.  Everyone should have the right to watch, read, or listen to whatever they want.  It all comes down to learning, and there is no censorship on learning.  So, please do not censor our libraries.  Allow the adults to censor what should be censored in their families"	4	4		4	4	3	4																		
4477	2	"How would you feel if someone told you that you couldn't have certain food in your fridge that sence its bad for your health or they might think it taste bad. You would not be too happy about it. Well its the same thing when people want to censor the libraries.     When people try to censor the libraries they try to take out books that are 'offensive'. If someone that likes those kind of books and they are being taken off. Its unfair for that person because they are being limited on what they can get from the libaries. Libaries are soppose to be a place where you can get books or magazines that you like to enjoy but they cant do that because people are trying to cencor the books.     The people that want to cencor certain books say that they might offensive not only to them but they could also for the kids. Well I say to that, you don't have to bring your kids to that section. You don't have to read those books you can just leave them alone for the people that like reading them.     To the people that want to cencor certain books what makes a book offencsive? Whos to say if that is offensive or not? The two views are differnt just because one person thinks its offensive doesnt mean another person thinks the same.     My opinion is leave the books there and let people enjoy the books they like to read. No book is bad every book does good for you because it builds your education, it could also be a stress reliever, and something you like to do on your free time. The people that are getting cheated out on the books they like because they are being cencored. What if the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 series got cencored because of the magic.To some people that might be an offensive book and if that book was taken off the shelve we would lose one of the greatest books and @CAPS3 of people would be upset.      So the way I see it everyone should be entitled on what books they can choose. To the people that don't like certain books just leave them there you don't like to read them thats fine. Everyone is entitled to there rights like Katherine Paterson said 'You have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for an of us' So we should all get to read what we enjoy to read, cause reading is endless"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4485	2	"Have you ever picked up a book, video, or music from the self and wondered why is this here, it's not a well thing for our younger kids to read, watch or listen to. I think that we should pluck out these types of books on our shelf at our libaray to better our community for our kids and their kids. We have all the right to voice our opion on things that we think should and shouldn't be in our libaray. Books that promote sexual activity, killing people, using or taking drugs, and other harmful things, which isn't the best for our kids to read, listen to, or watch should be removed from our libaray shelf.     Have you ever noticed how are crime rate and drug rate has went up in the past few years? These types promotes are in some of our books, videos, and other media. If we remove the videos, books, and other media that promote this kindof behavior we would have less of this type of crimes going on. I don't believe we would have all this crimes going on if we would remove this type of media because we all have a person we want to be like in a song or tv show or even in a book so we follow what they do, if they promote crime you try to act like them. We as humans follow the actions of others weither we think about it or not.     Music also plays a big roll in this to, music containing bad laguage or promoting someone to take drugs or kill people, has been proven to play with our minds. Would you as a parent want to see your kid raised up in a community that promotes sex, drugs, kill people, and other things that we shouldn't do? There's music we all like out there, we listen to what we like so that being, if we like rap for explain, if it promotes killing we are more likely to follow that action in the song because your mind thinks it's self out of it being a crime to kill cause you like rap music so it must be okay.     We @CAPS1's in our community believe that we should abstian our selfs from this kindof behavior and we don't see to many drugs, killings, or sexual activity. The bilbe teaches us to stay away from things that promote drugs, killing, or sexual activiy, thus we don't see much of these behavoirs in a @CAPS2 home or community. @CAPS4 are more better off then lot's of us weither we want to aceppt that or not. They live a life after @CAPS3, which don't promote all these behavoirs. and I know that @CAPS4 would be more willing to take out these type of media in our libaray. You can sit for one whole day and watch the actions of @CAPS4 and how they act they don't act like normal people as far as into drugs and stuff like that, only because they abstain their selfs from media that promotes sex, killing, and drugs.     Now, if you want to help us make our community a better place for your kids and their kids, let's remove the harmful media in our libaray that promotes sex, drugs, and killing. I don't think you would want to see your kid doing drugs or killing people and messing up their lifes because you didn't help in removing this media. Please help us better our community for our kids and their kids and the genrations to come after us."	3	4		3	3	3	3																		
4486	2	"Should materials that some people find offensive be removed from libraries? No I do not think that any materials should be removed from libraries. A librarie should have lots of different kinds of books, magazines, music, and movies.     One reason I think that a librarie should have all sorts of different books is because everybody doesn't like to read the same thing. Like for example some kids could love to read scary and gory books and others could like to read books about sports or love stories. So maybe the kids that read sport books could be offended by all the gory books, but that wouldn't be fair to take them out of the librarie because some kids like to read gory books.     Another reason they shouldn't remove any magazines, books, etc, is because it is nice to get to read or look at different things. People would get bored if their librarie only had books about war. Kids need to learn how to read different kinds of stories. Also if your librarie has all different kinds of magazines kids could learn a lot of interesting facts. You can find a lot of amazing things in a magazine. So if you only had four magazines about the same thing kids wouldn't discover anymore cool facts.     A librarie is a place where kids like to go and enjoy some peace and quiet and look and read different things. So I think if you started taking specific things out of the librarie then I think kids would stop coming to the librarie. A librarie contains awsome infromation that kids could learn, but if you start taking things out then not that many kids will come to the librarie because they will not be learning @CAPS1 new.     So if I had any say in this I would keep all things in the librarie. I would not remove @CAPS1! You want people to come to your librarie so you dont want to do @CAPS1 that can jeperdize people coming to your librarie. I think if you start removing things then your going to have less and less people come in and eventually maybe your librarie will get shut down because you have no buisness. So leave everything on the shelves."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4487	2	"There a lot of things to life and sometimes we do need as much help as we can get. Sometimes people will do anything to get help or go anywhere to find it. Because when people feel lost it's the most scraest thing to a person. So they turn to reading books, listening to music, watching movies, also looking and reading magazins. But although thats not the best way you can go there times when you need to listen to your soul the most.     Now there was a time when know one knew how to read or even was a loud to read. But now adays reading as taking over. If you can read you can do anything , you could be the one to run to whole world one day if you read things right.      Books and magazins there are is not a big different between the two. Books can take you mind off some where that you  have never seen before and places like the wild, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, @CAPS1's, and high up and trees. It teaches you @LOCATION1 thing  but not every thing it teaches is good. Books can lie about whats about to happen to the world. Now magazing show you what all the starts are doing and how there living and what there house looks like and there money their begin home. There one thing you have to understand you can't always get scraed and thing what you reading is right you have to read your mind it see what it says about what you just read.     When you hear your favtor song what do you or when you see your favtor movie? Do start dancing or do you cry when they break up, do you say I can sing like her or do you rein act the part in the movie. These things can help you or make you think about things you shouldn't do to people or even to yourself.     Music can make you think about what your life has been throw or miss the person that  has died because they listen to that one song so much. Music can talk you in to killing yourself drive you crazy, hurt your soul when hear what someone else has been throw. Its all about how you take the song when you first hear it and take the messages out of it.     Movies show history and show you want happens to people when they do the wrong things what will happen to them. There could be a ican in the movie your watching and could want to be like him/her. But not everyone you see you shouldn't want to be like them. You have to be yourself at the end of the day. Because you wake up looking at you everyday and love you everyday and take care of you everyday.     When it's all said and done you have to belive in yourself and  not listen to what everyone is trying you. Go with you soul. Yes listening to it or read or even watching ir but just remember flow your deams and do what you love.

4489	2	"In libraries there are some books,music,magaizines that are not very apporiate to put on shelves. There are little kids that will want to look at anything they can get their hands on. They are very mysterious when it comes to that.      There are bad books but there are also good books in the library. If people found a book or any type of material in the library and found it offensive, then they should take it off the shelf. There are children that look at anything they want or what they think looks interesting. The library also should at least check what the book is about when it arrives at the library. That way no one would have to worry about a material being offensive. Movies should not matter really because there are a lot of bad movies but i dont think that people would find them offensive. They dont have to watch it and neither do their children.      There is a lot of bad music. I think there should be censorship on music because some music today is about drugs,alchoal, and violance. People would not want to see that in their local library for their children to see. I have seen on the news people get upset when they see something that they think is inappropiate for underage children. I would get mad too because i dont want an underage child to be listening to that type of music. Children now look up to these song writers and want to become them. That is not a good thing at all.      All magazines can be offensive to people just by looking at the cover and who the cover person is. Libraries would not put a inappropiate magazine on the shelves. There are some magazines that they have but they are good magazines even for children to read. I think that the libraries dont put offensive magazines out because they dont want any controversy. People today have came out even more good magazines for anyone to read that is not inappropaite for anyone.      I think some people today dont realize that the library would want to offend anyone by putting those offensive magaizines,movies,books and music. Putting censorship on those things would be a good thing because there are materials that are not good for small children to read or hear or watch. The parents dont want their children looking up to a person who is involved in violence or drugs or alchoal. Censorship would be they way to go on all those materials just to keep away contoversy and the children safe."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4498	2	"Have you ever read or listened to somthing that is so disturbing that you wonder how it even got the right to be published? Well, music, books, and magazines these days are full of garbage and innapropriete thoughts that children listen to and base there life off of. All of these resources that kids can find that has this kinda of material in it can be found in libraries. We have to put an end to it or find some source of censorship for these library resources.     A library has the tendency to be known as boring or a very plain place. If a kid in school comes through the hallway saying he found a really good book, other kids become interested in it; they find out it has drugs in it and they assume that this is not a boring book like all the others that you would find in a library. Then, more and more people get that book and other books that have this style of materials are being discovered and checked out. Now, all these children with these popular books consider themselves 'cool'. So, these children start making actions and start behaving the same way the characters are in the book. This leads to disaster.     Music can be the same way. Music that has been recorded in the past ten years pick up sexual references, drug usage, and innopropriete behavior in its lyrics. Why would anyone want to put this kind of material in there masterpiece? Well singers and writers have found out that pieces containing these topics have sold the most copies. So, every artist of any kind of work is puting these references in there books or songs. Now, singers are starting to make music videos which not along sings these lyrics but shows them as well. Children see these artist in these videos with attactive mates, lots of money, and living the 'perfect life'. So, this person try doing the same thing this artist did to make there life more like theres.      Movies come along then, movies have seen the ratings go up on these kind of styles, so they start puting them in there film. Now, all these pieces have this garbage in it and has had it in it for quite some time. How do we get it out? How do we get our children to stop getting these resources? No parents want to walk around and hear there children saying these things or doing these actions. So libraries have to have some censorship on there work; there work should be removed so minors wont get the wrong message.      What ever happened to the good old days when music, movies, and art was a special talent and was not looked up to as somthing that would get our children into some trouble? We need to get these censorships in libraries and get back to the good old days before things get more out of hand than they already are"	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
4504	2	"Pornography, vulgar language, grotesque scenes and many other things make books and movies inappropriate for some. In a culture like the one we have @DATE1, censorship usually takes the back seat. The media constantly portrays sensual elements and the language is also bad. People have always had a right to view what they want and read what they want due to the freedom that this very country provides. Every person is titled with their own opinion but there should not be censorship in libraries.     There are many things in libraries @DATE1 that portray bad images and contain questionable content. Books and movies have things in them that indeed children shouldn't view, but the library is not able to take them down. People enjoy seeing and hearing these things, that's why @CAPS1 comes out with more rated @CAPS2 movies than all the other ratings combined. They make the most money off of them. In @DATE1's economy, the library needs to keep these things on their shelf so that they can stay in business. If people are offended by it, then stay away from that area and don't pick up the book or movie. If someone were to decide to take down a book or movie that they view as offensive then they are breaking the freedom that this has. Censorship is an opinion based topic that one cannot make on their own.     As one can see, the censorship of books and movies is not entitled to a personal opinion. It is the duty of the library to keep the freedoms of the people and provide them with the entertainment that they want. Books and movies with adult content in them can also provide insight on what a society should not be like.

I belive that the some stuff can change out of the world. not from people's offense or not because there will be none left too sell if people had there points of being offensive because everything is offensive to at less one person would be offensive.     I think they need to get rid of things that causes the weak minded people will do if they see it and have it in there mind and go do it in real life getting rid of the things that can get the weak mind in trouble.

4511	2	"Should there be censorship in libraries? Some say there should be, some do not.  Cultural books and magazines could be offensive to some readers.  History in books can sometimes even be offensive depending on someones lifestyle or background.     Are you wrong if you say you want censorship in the library?  No, you are not wrong because there are many people who think that some books should be taken off of the shelves of there local libraries.  Some of there reasons are because parents could have  young children and they do not want to expose them to such things while they are young and vulnerable.  Others though say that censorship is unnecessary because people are going into the library and looking for a book at their own risk.  Meaning that if someone goes to the library looking for a certain book and they pick up one they find as offensive, it could be a good book for someone else.     Do all books that are considered 'offensive' have to be fiction?  No, not all books have to be fiction if they are offensive.  This does not mean that there aren't books out there like that.  Cultural books or magazines from other countries or of a certain topic can sometimes be very graphic and have language that is only appropriate for certain ages.  Everywhere in the @CAPS1 no matter where you are there are going to be things that could either interest you or be offensive to you. Everybody has there own opinion on the matter.  The cultural @CAPS3 in the library are just showing how the people of othere countries live and act.  It is not opinions or false claims in these @CAPS3, only fact.  So cultural @CAPS3 should not be censored, although it could have a section just for that type of material.     History books can be one of those @CAPS3 that really depends on your opinion or what you were raised in.  Religion is one thing that history books can really raise offense to people because it could have some of the facts wrong about that type of religion.  Some people would get very upset about how it was wrong because they are teaching the kids wrong about religion.  Race and origin are another problem with some people.  History books and elder's stories can always somehow be mixed and could cause trouble.  For example if a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1 veteran told a story about what happened in a certain area; the history book could tell a completely different story.  History books should not be censored because it is facts and teaching kids on what has happened in the past and how people survived.     My views on the censorship of libraries is that there should not be any of it.  Maybe the library could make a section for what people might think is 'offensive.'  @CAPS3 or books should definately not be taken off of the shelves though, because one man's offense is another man's great read"	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
4512	2	"Today, millions of teens are bombarded with all kinds of media garbage. This can range from exposure to certain movies, music, magazines, books, or to even commercials. Parents, teachers, and even governments censor materials such as these to protect the students or the general population on topics that can be offensive or difficult to explain. However is that really the right choice?      In life, we cannot shut our eyes and pretend that there are not harsh concepts out there in the world that we have to face. In fact, our parents and teachers should prepare us to be fully equiped when we go off on our own to find our place in the world. This then begs the question is it okay to censor certain books from the shelves of a library which can potentially enlighten us as growing students? When one conceals information, that person is stealing the right of knowledge. Not only that, but what one person finds offensive another can @MONTH1 not. This topic is just too abstract to be regulated. For example, take what Katherine Paterson said about how if everyone decided to work in this manner, all the books in the world wouldn't be available to any of us.      Therefore censorship in libraries should be condemned because we are only hurting ourselves in the long run when we limit the knowledge we decide to take in"	4	3		4	4	4	4																		
4519	2	"@CAPS1          @CAPS1 a day where there are no books in the school library. A librarian walks through the now empty corridors, reminising of the days before censoring, before everyone told her of what they found offensive. Everyones ideas are different, but that absolutely does not mean they should have everyone else comply.      Saying such, if someone finds a book offensive, they just should not pick it up. Just don't read it! By pushing to have the book taken out, they would be implying that they know best, and usually, they don't know best. A @CAPS2 could be offended by a fashion magizine in the library @LOCATION1 simply has an advertiziment for a body wash. She @MONTH1 say something like '@CAPS3 child shouldn't see things like this,' then demand it be taken out of the library.      Does that make sense? I didn't think so either. In addition, if one woman was able to take a magazine out of the library, then another man or woman would believe they had the same power. Censoring could become a casual thing, and books could be thrown out daily! Now, that's only on a small scale. @CAPS1 if they actually took this up with higher authorities. That book would be taken away from all schools in the @LOCATION1 brings us to this problem. Should we, as people,as normal citizens, really decide what others are able to read? The answer to that is a definate no.      Let's look on the other end of this now, too. What will happen to the authors who wrote the books that are now banned? As an example, I'll use @PERSON1. What would happen to her if the series '@CAPS4 @CAPS5' were banned from schools? Also, what about the kids that like to read? This is just taking good books away from the students...Because someone didn't believe in magic and threw a fit about it.      That librarian from the beginning is leaving now, theres no more books to check out, bring back, or read anymore. The kids have to go to a public library to get all the books they want to read, and are then still discouraged from reading because the material wasn't proper. This shouldn't happen. Books do not need to be censored, and people who have a problem with a book just shouldn't ruin it for everybody"	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
4523	2	"Libraries are filled with books, magazines, music, movies, and many more materials. All of the materials cover a really wide range of topics. For example, movies can be a comedy, mystery, or adventure. However, some of this material is not suitable for some viewers and can be very offensive to them. For this reason, these offensive materials should be removed from libraries.     One reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because it can lead to violence in teenagers. If a teenager is continually reading books or watching movies that have violence in them, then they might think violent behavior is all right. They might not know that violence is not the answer to many problems, and they will not realize that there are other solutions to a problem.      One case that proves seeing offensive material can lead to violence occurred in a high school. A straight-A student got a grade she thought she did not deserve from a teacher. This student then painted her face white, put on red lipstick, and took a knife to the teacher's classroom during school. She then proceded to threaten to kill the teacher. She got the idea from the movie '@CAPS1', and her costume resembled the @CAPS2. Some students in the classroom at the time called @NUM1, and the police officers convinced the girl to put down the knife. Maybe if she had not seen the movie she would not have threatened to kill her teacher.     Another reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because the material is sometimes inappropriate for younger children. The children might just be looking at books and magazines in the library and not even check it out. This way no one will know that they read it. Some of the books in libraries have subjects like sex and drugs in them. When the child reads this, he might want to do everything that is in the book. I have  read a book that contains sex and drugs. The book might put awful ideas into the child's head if he read it.     After all is said and done, offensive material should be removed from libraries. The material can lead to violent acts in people, even if it does not seem like that kind of behavior could possibly come out of that person. The material can also be inappropriate for younger children. All in all, material in libraries can be offensive to some people."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4535	2	"The books, magazines, music, and movies shouldn't be removed from the shelves.  They still have good information that someone other than you @MONTH1 want to know.  If you take them off of the shelves the people that want to use them don't have the opportunity.   If you remove books then if someone needs one for a reseach paper that they have to do they will not have the nessisary resouces to do the paper, and at the same time the person with the paper @MONTH1 feel that the non-educational books need to come off the shelves and then that person wont have the books that they want.     If they want the book taken off of the shelf, because of inopropriate language or nudity then the libraries can make a spot that you have to be a certain age to access them. I wasw at the library and there was a woman getting upset, because her son had a movie and book that she didn't think was good for him to have.  The, book and the movie, that he had were in a different area so that minors weren't suposed to get them.  So the woman would be the one that would probibly want to take them off of the shelves, but it wasn't the libraries fualt that he wasn't where he was supposed to be.      The products should stay on the shelves, because someone needs it for something or it wouldn't have been there in the first place.  If they take the products down that certain people don't like then the people that do like it will not have it.  If there are resons that people must have the product off of a shelf then the product should go somewhere else that can be accessed by the people that do want to you the products.  The products should stay on the shelves  so that the people who need, or just want to use the products can use the products."	2	3		2	2	3	2																		
4542	2	"Many different people have views on what they want their children to be exposed to, whether it be in books, movies, music, or any other type of media. So should libraries be more strict and remove certain items that might come across as offensive or vulgar to parents or even students? I believe that it completely depends on how a library advertises or who they allow to check out what.     I know that a certain case, specific to me, is that my mother did not like me reading a specific series becasue she thought that it was not an appropriate reading material for me. Because of that, that does not mean she marched down to the library and demand that they get rid of all the books written by that author. She respected the fact that others enjoyed reading the books and just asked me to steer clear of them and to find something more appropriate for me to read.     In many libraries, I know that they have certain areas for specific age groups of people like children, teenagers, and adults. Within those specific designated areas, they have kind of 'sub-area' where they seperate educational from entertainment and so on. Let's say one parent gets offended by a specific section, such as a sex education section, should they ask the library to remove it completely? I do not think that will help anything because there are students who use that topic for areas they are studying and parents who use it as educational tools with their own children.     I do believe that libraries should put stamps or notices on their different types of media saying that only a certain age group is aloud to look at them and be able to check them out. An eight year old should not be able to go in and get a @NUM1 movie whenever they want to. There should be restrictions on areas like that, but for someone to come in and say to take out all the @NUM1 movies is a ridiculous thing to do because there are others who enjoy that type of entertainment.    Libraries to respect the fact that there are different types of people with different interests and they try to make their environment as comfortable for everyone as possible. They will have children's videos seperate from the adult videos and they even have a whole seperate section of books for them to discover and journey into. The only thing that I believe should not be in libraries is vulgar magazines or videos. A library is still a public, family area, after all, and no child should accidentily stumble upon any raunchy article.     So, should libraries completely remove areas of media? I do not think so. I think that they should distinguish from adult's and children's materials. Katherine Paterson says, 'But if I have the right to remove books from the shelf . . . then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we continue to take books off of the shelves then eventually there will be nothing to read."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4545	2	"The question was asked 'Do you believe certian matierals, such as books, music, movies, moagazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive,' No! By taking away these things, such as books, music, magazines, or movies off the self, that @MONTH1 seem 'offensive' your taking away things that people enjoy. Not many people including me would agree with the passage of censorship on items like these. So should we do this, I dont believe that we should. There are many reasons that this should not be passed.     First by using this censorship, you might lose more customers in that store selling these such items. Once the store has lost customers, they lose money, then they might even lose their store. A lot of people like things that dont have any limits to them. They often find their joy in these things. I know that i, myself like reading books, listening to music that has no limits. So if your taking them away or puting limits to it, are people really gonna want to have these things?     Secondly, if there is really an issue with books and etc, that are not suitable for kids, then put the books and etc,  in catogories. These catorgories would put the things not suitable for children, apart from the ones that children should be reading. Since there are no real solutions besides banning these items, this would be the best plan.      Finally, as katherine paterson stated 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self.' If this is really a problem then the the parents need to watch what their child is reading, because it isn't right to have everything taken away from the society just because the parents are concerned with what their child is reading.      So what do you think, should this be such a law. The choice is yours. Just remember though, if you agree with this then. Just think of everything you are taking away from other people, do you really want to be that heartless?"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4547	2	I do believe that we can have Materials because there are some good materianls thats have some good stuff in that.Book yes if we don't have no book we can't leave. If we don't have book how we people know how to read.Music i will said yes and no because some time music is not good but some time people need music to do they work. I will say know to magazines because it be to much in that.It be stuff thin them that @CAPS1 sould not see.	2	1		2	1	1	1																		
4555	2	"Books, music, movies, and magazines are all things people use for entertainment and study, something that everyone should have access too.      If someone is offended by one of these things i do not think that they should be removed off shelves or advertisements. Many people will still find these books or other recources interesting. If the source is something more adult then it should be placed in a section that is labeled or supported by information that says so.          Radio stations play songs that talk about sex, drugs and violence but i believe that kids need to be associated with these things. Parents can't keep their children from it all of there life, and most of the bad things said are cut out.     Everyone has a different interest in the things that he or she likes. So why should you pull something off the shelf in stores or libraries just because its offensive to one person"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4558	2	"Yes, I believe that certian materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Some people do not want to read about those things that they have less intrest in. Materials like that can offend many people, so they should be removed from public shelves.      For example, someone, by accident, @MONTH1 stumble upon a book containing inappropriate materials. They could take it home and begin reading it, and realize that the material that they are reading contains information that offends them. That really concerns some people and can hurt the library that held the book, and they could begin losing customers.      Another reason why inappropriate materials should not be publicly displayed is, children. What if a young child was wondering around a store or a library, and randomly picked up a book or magazine with offensive pictures in it? That young child would see things that were not meant for that child to see. But, it does happen. Imagine how angry the parents of the child would be. They would most likely do everthing they could to get those materials removed from being displayed in public and from being within a child's reach. Children deffinately do not need to be seeing those things and also, even some adults do not even prefer it.      Religion is also an example of why places should watch what they put on their shelves. It @MONTH1 be against some religions to read inappropriate materials. And with out them knowing their book contained it and they read it, they would be greatly offended and very upset. That could turn many people away from reading certain books, or even going to the store where they even purchased those materials.      In conclusion, all of these are perfect examples of why inappropriate materials should be removed to prevent people from being offended. This is why materials such as books, magazines, etc. should be removed from public shelves, because they can offend many people"	4	3		4	4	3	4																		
4560	2	I do not really read books. I think that offensive things sould be tooken off shelves because there could be a sene if they are'nt. There are many people who will fight if they are truely offended and it is not a pretty sight.	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
4562	2	"Censorship in libraries has been an issue among communities for as long as literature has been around. As expressed by Katherine Paterson, if one has the right to remove a book from the shelf that he or she deems unexceptable, then everyone has the right to remove books that he or she deem unexceptable. Everyone has an individual view of what is unexceptable, so that @MONTH1 leave no book to be left on the shelf. In saying this, if the government censors materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines, there is nothing to keep them from banning all that is there. There is bound to be someone that wants a certain thing to be censored, but the government @MONTH1 not see it a something to be censored. This brings up another question, what deems something unexceptable to be viewed? In my mind, this is a matter of opinion, so should we leave something like this in the government's hands to decide upon? I do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should ever be censored. It is the choice of the individual to read, listen, or watch a certain material.      The government's opinion of whether something should be censored or not has changed over time. The novel, 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' was onced censored and banned by the government for it contained language and scenes that were viewed as inappropriate for readers. If this work were to remain banned, this canon of american culture, the effect that it had on american literature to this day would have been lost.      I see literature as another form of art. Art should never be censored, for the lack of it will halt all developments in our society. Artists are ones to take risks and so are writers. If people were not allowed to take risks, what would become of our society? Developments that have been made by researchers, inventors, artists, and writers were once possibly deemed as risk. Should we have censored them?     Another instance under which censorship had had a negative affect on society and culture was during the @CAPS2 regime. Music, books, art, movies, everything was censored or banned under @CAPS3's rule. A whole generation was lost under his power, for they were deemed enexceptable just because he did not like them. Now, should we put the power of picking what is unexceptable into the hands of one group of people? Whole generations of books, music, etc. could be at stake under such principles. There should be no reason that we are not allowed to see, read, or listen to whatever we would like to as a nation.      The government, with the ability to censor libraries, can hinder our exposure to ideas unknown to us. Lack of exposure is the cause of a society's ignorance of the world around it. Who will stop the government from censoring what could be the next major masterpiece in literature? Nothing stopped them from banning 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1,' so is there limit? This is the question one has to ask themselves, to keep the government from potentially cutting the nation off from future masterpieces."	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
4569	2	"Everyone has their own opinion about certain things in life. Maybe its politics; it could be a sports team. Everyone has a right to their own opinion. As for reading materials, the opinions could be endless and even painful to hear.      Opinions of some books and media type materials are biased. People could often be offended by the materials that can be accessed through a public library. For instance, let's say a grandmother and her grandchild are at the public library. The grandchild picks up a self-help book and starts to read. Later the grandmother reads it and finds out it says everything opposite of what the grandchild was taught about life by herself and her parents. To the grandmother, @CAPS1 is offensive.      Through observation, I have noticed when a person picks up 'an offensive book' and reads a little of it, they tend to put it right back where they found it. It obviously isn't hard to do. So why should a book be taken out of a library when all you have to do is set it down and leave it? The same goes for music, movies, and magazines. If you don't like the music, don't listen to it. If you don't think it would be a 'nice' movie, don't go out and see it. If the magazine seems raunchy, don't buy it.      @PERSON1 said it well, that if we took all the offensive books off the shelf '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 statement is as true as any statement could be. What would be left? Everyone has an opinion and likely someone will always find it offensive. Therefore offensive books and media should be allowed to stay on the shelves.      Whether or not you find a book, movie, music, or magazine that is offensive, why fret over it? It's just easier to move on and forget it. Ignorance isn't all bad"	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
4577	2	"There are many things out in the 'material' world that people take offense to. No matter what, there are always those people who have to be against whatever it is, whether it be a book or a song or a movie. But they do not have any idea what they are doing when they bring up their 'rights'. If they get to say that they are offended by the certain media product, not only do they announce that they have the right to try to have it banned, but they are giving the people who do not find offense in the material to dish out the same. If they can pull something off the shelves that they 'find offense to', then everyone @CAPS4 a right to. Another thing is that they claim to find offense to the song or book or movie, but if it bothers them that bad, they should just not listen/read/watch what @CAPS5 it is that they are feeling offends them. It would be that simple, just switch radio stations, or pick up another book, or watch a different movie. Another thing that the 'offended' people can try is having an open mind. It would make everything far less dramatic.      People that say that they have offense to whatever the material @MONTH1 be usually use the phrase '@CAPS1 it's offensive and i don't want my kid to stumble across it.' They say that they have a right to take whatever the 'offensive material' is off the shelf and keep it from the public. They couldn't be more right and stupid at the same time! If they have a right to take a certain thing off the shelf, then @ORGANIZATION1 (the writer of the song/book/movie) can claim that he @CAPS4 been offended by some song/book/movie that the first person likes. Then it's just a free-for-all for everyone one to start taking everything off the shelves, one by one. Everyone @CAPS4 the same rights, and if the first offended person uses them to bring @ORGANIZATION1 down, then @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 the right to do the exact same thing. So the government shouldn't let things be taken off of shelves, because if they take one down, they might as @CAPS1 take everything else down with it.     So, if some one finds offense to a song they hear on the radio, and they feel that strongly as to they want it removed from radios and anywhere that plays music, then they need help. When they find that song THAT offensive, then there is only one simple solution: turn the freaking radio to something else! Seriously, if someone finds the song offensive, then why are they going to sit there and listen to the entire song? Or if they find a book offensive. Would I sit and read an entire book if I don't like the content? Umm, no. If some one is that offended by whatever the material is, then they need to just do something else, because it's pretty rediculous to waste more time attempting to ban the song or the book that to just change the radio or find a different book. So if you're going to complain about the song or book being out there, just take your attention to something else, because every song, book, or movie out there @CAPS4 a right to be sold.     On a light note, they could just have an open mind so that the song, or the book, or the movie can still be sold. They can try and read through the book to see if there is a reason that the author @CAPS4 written it this way. If they are conflicted by a movie, they should just watch it and test it to see if they really need to have it pulled off the shelf. Or if they are listening to the song, listen to it all the way through, or maybe even twice. The artist who sang the song might have been expressing themselves in a very deep way, and if someone pulls their song off the radio or where @CAPS5 it is played, then someone could be offending them in return. Having an open mind will let the so called 'offended person' see a whole other light being shown on why the 'offensive material' was even created. Then everything can stay ON the shelves!     People have opinions, and that is one hundred percent okay. But sometimes people think that their opinions are the only opinions that matter. If some people get offended (or think they get offended) by something, they would try to removed whatever it was from the nations stores. But if they just sit back and think about it, then it would be okay. If they have a right to remove anything from the shelves, so does everyone. If that @CAPS2 @CAPS3 song really, really offends they, they should just change the radio station and forget about it. And if they have open minds as to why the things are still 'out there', then all the songs, and all the books, and all the movies will still be on the shelves for people to buy. I do not approve of removing anything from stores just because one person feels like if they don't like it, then it absolutly @CAPS4 to go. No, they world doesn't just revolve around one person, and it never, @CAPS5 will."	5	5		5	4	4	4																		
4578	2	"Controversy in the @CAPS1          @CAPS2 someone walks in to there public @CAPS1 they are overwelmed with books. Even though one person could never read that many books, the @CAPS1 has to have a wide selection, for the people that read different thing. The @CAPS1 should not get rid of books that offened some people. the @CAPS1 is a public place that allows people to read what they want. If someone dose not agree to what another person is reading they don have to be there.     Since the @CAPS1 is a public place, and people can not just throw away a book because that is offensive. Just like Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If everyone would throw away books that were offensive, there would be no books left. This would cause a lot of people to stop reading and learning.      The public @CAPS1 is open for anybody to read a book. Keeping this in mind the @CAPS1 has to have books that appeal to everyone. If they would only have one type of book, not many people would want go the the @CAPS1. the @CAPS1 has to offened some people to please others.     People who go the @CAPS1 go because it is there choise to go and get a book. If people find the books in the @CAPS1 offensive, they do not have to go. Books that people find offensive are on the shelf for others who want to read them. If someone finds a book offensive they dont have to read it.     Librarys should have as many books as they can, so they can appeal to every taste. They should not get rid of books that offened a small group of people. Those people do not have to read books that they find offensive. Librarys are a public place for anybody to read what they want."	4	4		4	3	3	3

Now it would be diffeint if it was a childerins book store like if they have music like christin bible songs or desine movies in the store but not to have grown-up stuff.     I really do not see the big deal if they are out because everyone likes reading somthing differint. I think as long as your reading whats it matter what it is or as long as your learning something.      I do not think u can get stuff out like movies and magazines because people like to read them to much or leason to music.

4586	2	"Should we censor the materials in libraries?  Some people believe that some of the books, magazines, and music in libraries are too vulgar and obscene.  This could be a major problem if people are allowed to say what is too obscene to be put in a library.  Katherine Paterson makes a great point by saying that if everyone was allowed to take books, magazines, and music that they find inappropriate off the shelves, there would be nothing left for us.     Books have been around for centuries.  They are passed on, shared, and enjoyed by people all over the world.  Books contain important information, stories, and tales of people's past times.  Therefore, I do not believe that certain books should be banned from libraries.  By taking away books in libraries, you are taking away the author's freedom of speech.  Also, technology is rapidly advancing, and sometime in the future, I think libraries will become extinct.  With all of the new devices we have @DATE1, people can just get their books online.     Magazines are a great tool to advertise and talk about some major topics happening around the world.  Magazines are a great thing to read when you want to catch up on news, sports, or just other miscellanious topics.  With that said, magazines can also be bad for public libraries due to some of the explicit content.  This is a reason on why some people would want to get rid of magazines from libraries, but I don't think they should be banned.  By getting rid of magazines, you take away company's freedom of press, which is a major issue.  Refering to the previous paragraph, technology is growing, and it is very easy to just go and look at news, sports, and other topics on the @CAPS1.  That is why I do not think magazines should be taken out of libraries.     My final discussion is music.  Music has also been around for many centuries and it has done many things.  Music is something everyone can relate to.  No matter who you are, you probably have some favorite band, music artist, or genre of music that you prefer.  By saying this, I do not think music should be taken out of libraries either.  Taking away music is like taking away humans natural culture.  We all enjoy it, but have different versions that we enjoy.  Therefore, I do not think it would be wise to take away music from libraries.     In conclusion, libraries are nothing without all the history, stories, news, and music that is inside of it.  Censoring the libraries would not be a good idea and it would most likely upset many people.  It is true that with technology that libraries @MONTH1 eventually become extinct.  Until that happens, I hope they do not censor their materials."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4587	2	"Most people have been debating on whether or not to stop giving out books, movies, music, magazines, and so on, if they are  disturbing other peoples lives, and offending them to the point where they are getting infuriated, and disturbing the peace. I also think that many people have been complaining about the violence in the community due to several disturbing books, music, and so on. But I would have to say that most people live off of or get entirely influenced by what they read or hear. I think that this accomnomy should get over itself and learn to live their lives. I personally do not think that anybody should be punished for what is being put on the library shelves, stores, like music for instance. I do not think other people who actually enjoy reading and listening to that stuff, if they are happy then so be it then they are happy. I do not think that people who actually enjoy reading, and hearing what is disturbing that Other people should be punished just because somebody else does not like what they are hearing or reading. Why should things that bother other people be removed when they are not hurting anything or anybody. I personally, in my own opinion think that would not be fair. because, in my experience I do not think people should complain. What is in these stores only makes us stronger."	2	3		2	3	3	3																		
4595	2	"I believe that they should leave leave them on the shelves. I think people take stuff like that to serious, if they dont like it I think they should just leave it alone.What some people might find offensive others will find interesting. There is alot of stuff out there that might be a little offensive to some people, but if they dont like it all they have to do is put it up and go on with there life like its no big deal.     In the past there has been some movies that make fun of people for the way they act or just something they did in the past. Stuff like that I can understand because that can be personal reasons. There has also been times when I have seen people make a big deal over nothing.Sometimes people say stuff and the person reading it can take it a whole different way.There is still alot of people taking books off the shelf because of someone complains about the language in it or maybe making fun of another race.     I think the worst thing today is magazines because they are always judging people about who they are with, what they did @TIME1, or even who has the best body and who has the worse body.I think people should just stop worrying about everybody else so much and just worry about theirself and we wouldnt have so many problems."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4602	2	"How many of you out there absolutely love to read? Well, im going to be the first to confess that I do not prefer reading. Meanwhile, whether or not I prefer or differ readings of all types, I despise of any negative books. Censoring books is very important in today's lifestyle. One can make an inference by looking at the cover of a book. The cover oftens creates a vivid image and will usually promote a general idea. Let's look at some reasons why I feel that graphic or offensive books should be removed from book shelves.          What about the younger children who like to read? Although kids have a wild imaginaion, authors should't fill their heads with too many crazy ideas. First of all, kids now days either grab a book from the shelf and show interest very quickly, or automatically assume it's not for them. Furthermore, when a kid comes across a very offensive book it could hurt there feelings. Books are supposed to provide eductional information or be entertaining. They should not be dirty, nor discouraging towards certain people.           More importantly, how many different races are there here in @LOCATION1, or even all around the world? Many different races take interest in new books to learn new ways. When they come across books that are not teaching for all races or are actknowledging bad examples on thier kind, they feel discouraged. Whether it's a movie, magazine, books, or even a song, never should it be offensive towards anyone. When authors, publishers, song writers, or movie producers release these items, they do not think of the surroundings. Thier main concept is to entertain, but sometimes entertainment can be quite bashful.           Most importantly, if it contains sexual gestures it should be removed without debate. It's offensive to parents with young children who visit libraries. A public library which is open to all, should have sections for books, movies, cd's or magazines that are too vivid. There's a wide range of books laying around and one @MONTH1 come across one that is strongly offensive. I believe they should have a word in whether or not the book belongs on the shelf or not. I've not experienced it yet, but believe me it could happen anytime in our world today. If i was a parent I wouldn't encourage sexual magazines or books being shown at a public library.      Finally, during this debate older or more dirty minded people will counterargue this topic. Who says children should be allowed in the adult sections? Why are the discouraged people reading books that are setting bad examples? Those are some of the questions you will here for those who counter what I've written today. Adults should be allowed there own personal section for adultlike books, movies, or magazines. Kids under age should stick to searching for books in areas or fields that will provide interest for them.      In conclusion, those who counterargue could be on the winning side, however I still believe offensive books should be removed from shelves. Book lovers all around the world want enteratinment, but in good ways. The younger children of our time right now need to be influenced the proper way. Furthermore, there is no better way to help improve society than by removing offensive and noninfluential books from libraries. Lets make an inference and say, if we work to remove these offensive books, younger children will become more educated."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4604	2	"What happened to everyone having the right to have freedom of knoledge? I do not believe that certain materials should be removed only for the reason that someone finds it 'offensive' or 'inappropriate'. Our youth have the right to access these materials. Kids should have that right because it allows more access to knoledge, it provides more realistic details about life, and keeps them from being shut out from the world around them. We cannot deprive children of that.     First of all, all children and students at schools all over should have access to more knoledge. If certain materials are censored and taken away, they cannot access that type of learning. What if a student wants to learn more about how goverment and politics work by reading an an article. But then, the article is taken away because of one small comment in it. We cannot take away our aspiration to learn more about the world.     Secondly, it can give a more realistic image of a person, place, thing, or event. Explicit content can give children more details about how things really are in life. If that is taken away, they might have a different understanding of how things really are and have different expectations of things. This might have an emotional or psycalogical impact on them once they see the real world. They should be well informed of what life is like in further detail to avoid confusion once they get to that point.     Finally, they could be shut out from the world if everything is kept from them because of censorship. Being kept from that kind of knoledge can be an emotional strain. A friend of mine had parents that kept her from many things in the world around her, blinding her from what she should have known. As she got older, things became harder and harder for her. And now, she is affraid of many things out in the real world. This is all because her parents had used cencorship to keep her from knowing what was important.      Our students should always have access to knoledge, details about life, and not kept from knowing enough to have an undertanding of things in our modern world. We cannot allow censorship to make such irrational descisions about what we do and do not have access to. And if it has such a negative impact on society and our youth, why isn't it censored"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4622	2	"I think there should be censorship in libraries for those who dont like, or are not comfortable with what is on the shelf. Someone shouldn't have a problem with goin or taking their children to the library.          A public library is visited by children of all age's, size's, and races. If i took my child or children to a public library i dont want to worry about wether or not my child reads or views something they shouldn't or dont like"	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
4632	2	"@CAPS1 happened to using books and films as simple entertainment? Why are we now cautious of @CAPS1 our children pick off the shelf? Society today has changed the way we once viewed our sources of entertainment. Books are now viewed with skepticism and once harmless movies and magazines are full of material no one should be reading or watching. Music used to be a beautiful form of art, but now when you turn on your radio, @CAPS1 do you hear? Mindless spewing of words linked together with curses and other garbage. Should libraries use caution when renting something to someone who shouldn't be using that material for harmless entertainment.     There once was a young girl, fourteen or fifteen, who loved to read and listen to music. She was bright but shy, and used books as her friends. Each day she walked to the library for a new story to dive in. One day she came across a book on the top shelf of the fiction section. The book looked used, for its spine was badly split and several of the pages were nearly detached. She reached for the book, intrigued, and flipped through the pages. Her innocent and naive mind caught a hold of a world she didn't know. After reading the book, she was filled with guilt. It wasn't a good book, but a book that was laced with a harmful message. This young girl, once pure and simple, now knew things no one at that age should know. So, why wasn't there a warning of some sort?     The difference between writing something offensive and being offensive is that the writer usually doesn't intend to be hurtful or rude. The author most likely intended for the peice of literature to be enjoyed with a clear and playful attitude. However the comparison between writing something offensive and being offensive is far different. When you read something in a book or magazine that disturbs you, put it down, or throw it away. No one is forcing you to read the material. Yet, the real question is; @CAPS1 about our children? How do we keep them safe from offensive literature? And @CAPS1 about music? Or movies?     Remember the old black and white films? How, no matter @CAPS1 the plot or storyline is, the two leading roles somehow fall in love in the end? The ending title fills the screen just before the two actors share a kiss and then the screen goes black. Mind, there are still movies with happy endings and a positive message. @CAPS1 about the other films? Some of the biggest blockbusters are those which have either violence, some form or racism, and/or sexual content. Personally going to the movies to see a new action movie that looks thrilling and entertaining should be fun, but where does the fun stop? After the guy in the first scene has just been brutally murdered? Or after the two lovers share a special bond that should be kept private? And @CAPS1 happens when this movie is released and checked out from the library by a young boy who just wants a fun sleepover with his friends? How do we keep these sorts of material away from them?     Libraries should use major caution when priting labels to place on their books, movies, magazines, etc. Librarians should make sure that the book a child hands to them is safe to read for that age level. Also, they should check the ratings on movies or make them not available to certain age group. Parents should also use caution when letting your child go to the movies with friends. Make sure they see something fun, but with a positive message.     Should libraries take certain material off their shelves? I don't think so. However, be careful @CAPS1 you read or watch, for it might not please you. Use the internet as a source to find reviews on books and magazines, so see how well it was rated and then decide whether it is an intriguing read or an amazing film. Have fun, but be careful"	6	6		6	4	4	4																		
4636	2	"People should have a right to listen, read, and watch whatever they want. It is people's own choice to what they read, watch, or listen to. They will not be able to change that person by taking out offensive movies or books. They will only go somewhere else and do it.      People have a right to read, listen to, and watch what they feel is good for them. If others find that offensive then that is their problem. People make their own decisions and that is their right. I feel that if you tell someone that they can not do a certain thing that will only make them want to do it more.      Taking offensive books, music, movies, and magazines will not solve a problem that our society has with being offensive to others, it will only mask it. Taking them out will not all of a sudden make people stop being offensive to others, they just won't do it in libraries.            Every book, music or movie will be offensive to some other person and if we take all the offensive stuff out there will be nothing left to read. It is just something that we will have to deal with. So I do not agree with censorship in libraries.      It will only take away our right to read and view what we want but also it will take away all the offensive movies and books we have; which is almost every book. Everyone feels that one book or another if offensive to them and if we take away those books we will have nothing left in our libraries"	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4637	2	"censorship     No,i dont think they should take certin book off the shelves, there are alot of thing out there that can be found offensive; gangs, politics, race, even school that small children go to.      I can understand wanting to shelter your children, but you cant keep them from every thing. Inner cities have gangs that right awfal words on trains, building, and about anything they possible can. an you cant just take that off the shelf.     Politics can be the worst, during presidentual elections they are always bring up there color of skin, and about everything they can find out about the other person. All of your kids watch this on tv.     Race wars can get bad, people all around the world are fighting just because the color of there skin. You cant him them from it either, its an on going battle that will never be one and it will keep getting worse.     I cant speak for other schools but mine has a lot of little problems; little kids cussing, the older kids fighting, then there are the people that try to do good in school and get picked on for it.      You cant hide you kids for ever, sooner or later they will find out about these problems. If you want to help your kids keep them off the streets because reading it in a book is alot better than them seeing it in the real world. You have to prepare them for the problems ahead, and if you dont then they might  get hurt alot worse than the little words in a book or a magazines or movies."	3	3		3	3	4	3																		
4639	2	"What is censorship? Many would say it's a book without cuss words or it's a movie without racism. For me, I think censorship is covering up the truth. I don't think movies or books should be taken off the self because some people find it offensive. When a book uses a cuss word to show anger or simply use the word, I think that it's okay because isn't that what we hear in the world already? Now I know some people @MONTH1 not have grown up hearing foul words but many of us have.      With movies I think that if people have a problem with their children watching something bad or offensive then they shouldn't let their kid watch it. Thats whats wrong with people now a days, they don't want to take blame for things that go wrong in their lives. People use censorship as a way to make themselves feel like their a good parent or that the world owes them something.      When it comes to someone thinking that a movie or book has gone to far with their race then censorship gets thrown around. Many people have issues with their race or nationality being messed with. Though it's funny to see that race use those foul words among themselves but when it's in a book it's racism. Or when a certain race is being made fun of or shown in a movie in a way that that race doesn't feel comfortable with, that movie is called racist.      I feel that if people have an issue with something they don't agree with, then they should take it out of their own lives. Too many people try to control something, like cencorship. For years now people have wanted books that are read in school to be censored for bad language. Why put all that time toward the book being censored and not the school. I know kids in school use foul language all the time. Even worse then the books we read. If adults would realize it's their kids they need to censore and not the books then censorship wouldn't have become such a huge issue. People need to just realize that by cencoring the books or movies doesn't make the offencive words or bad images go away, it just covers them up"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4641	2	"I think if its offensive it should not be avavible for kids intill they are old enough to read it, listen to it. I think they need to be removed from shelves or put away.     Because it can be hurtful, dirty for younger kids and it could be prevented if they are removed from shelves.     I belive the magazines can be put away or put into its own sections. Music or movies could be put in there own sections also. Internet could be blocked for certain websites.     Luckly the time we live in has people to prevent these things to happen like adults. And people to watch you and can tell you you are too young for that stuff.     This is what I think it could be easily prevent just put them up or removed and taken off shelves. If they are offensive remove them so we dont have to worry if are children are reading them or not."	3	3		3	3	2	3																		
4645	2	"People find things offensive everyday. It is just a matter of life. Some people have a right to feel offended for some reasons, but they really can't control it from happening. It is just something that has occured for thousands of years. And people have slowly began to deal with it.     So therefore, i believe that books and other materials that are found offensive should not have to be taken down because it offends someone, because taking it down could offend someone else. What i'm really trying to get across is that no matter what, not everyone will be happy. Life is filled with mixed society and emotions, so not everyone will agree on the same thing. Also it should be up to the library whether or not they want to remove some of their material. Because they did pay for it and have a right to let people in society watch, read, or listen to it. Thus being said, i believe that they should try to keep certain offensive material to a minimum. Such as racism, it seems as though rasicm impacts alot of the country still today. And will forever be an on growing matter in problems around the @CAPS1.          In conclusion, i believe that the library has a right to own books or movies that are somewhat offensive. Because like i said everyone deals with it at one point, and not everyone can be happy. And some of the material is most likely educational and teaches us about the history of the @LOCATION1,@CAPS1, ect, rather than being racist or offensive as everyone jumps to conclusions about. And everyone needs to get past the offensive side and get to a level where everyone sees eye to eye. For we are all the same, but yet, still broken up among looks and culture"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4646	2	"The librarys are made for everyone, from childern to adults. There @MONTH1 be somethings that should not be in certian areas or even in the place at all.      With the librarys having all age groups of books there,  their @MONTH1 or should not be some material in thoes areas for them to see. let alone @MONTH1 not even be there to begin with. Any age of childern can pick up a material that @MONTH1 contain eaither offensive/or just some things that they should not see. I think that librarys should only contain materials that are approiate for all age groups.      This is my oppion why i think librarys should only have materials with approiate images and words for all age groups. You dont know what your or someone eals child @MONTH1 pick up and read or hear. The beat thing to do is have all approiater materials and nothing eals"	2	2		2	2	2	2																		
4651	2	"I believe that certain materials should not be removed if they are found innapropriate. There are several things that explain why I think this.     For one thing, some libraries don't have certain genres of books. For example, say one library @MONTH1 have action but not thriller while another library has thriller but not action. If some materials were removed from public libraries due to censorship, people would only be able to find it online or in certain stores. Second reason being that kids would not get into these kind of books if it was innapropriate, unless they're given approval by parents. If these materials were to still be on shelves, you should at least be a certain age to read it, unless the parents make it to where their kids don't have to get approval from them first. Sure it would make the library more kid-friendly, but a book shouldn't be kept away from a kid only because of a few bad words. Lastly, some adults would be upset of the removal of some books. Some books that are intended would be better off staying in the library. If they were to remove these books, adults would then have to find a book online.     So censorship, to me, is not going to make any difference. If this continues, it @MONTH1 lead so far, that the libraries would have to be closed. Take my word for it. In conclusion, don't let censorship take over our libraries."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4660	2	"We have all been to a library at some point in our life. Have you ever been looking around and seen something that @MONTH1 have been offensive, or something you didnt agree with? What if you had the chance to have if takin off the shelves for good? Or, what if someone else had the choice to? Would you allow them to do so?     In my opinion, I would say no. Someone does not have the right to take reading material off the shelves, just because it @MONTH1 be offensive to them, or there way of life. I say, if you do not like it, do not look at it, it is simple as that. For example, what if you were into rap, or the hip hop culture, and someone finds that offensive? Would you give them the right to keep it from you? Or, would you really want to do that to someone else?  Lets say you are a christian, and an atheist finds the @CAPS1 offence, or untruthfull, so he has it takin off the shelves. Does that sound fair to you? If someone was to not like a certain topic or culture, or finds it offensive, all they would have to do, is simply stay away from it.     The point is, if we all were to take something off the shelves, there would adventually be nothing left. Respect what other cultures and ways of life do, and stay away from what offends you. Would you like someone to have what you like takin off the shelves? I would not, so you should not do that to other people."	3	3		3	4	4	4																		
4661	2	"It seems today we attempt to censor everything, but are we going too far?  Could it be that we have crossed the line and are no longer protecting the children, but are instead holding back our society as a whole?  In my opinion, censorship of literature has crossed the line.     A library is, essentially, an incredably valuable resource to each generation.  In some cases it still is, but when books are being with held do to the fact that it @MONTH1 offend someone we are holding people back from the knowledge they could gain from the work of literature itself.  We attempt to placate everyone in today's society, therefore we censor several things that are not politically correct.  If future generations are unable to learn what we have through these writings, then they will lack the insight we had gained.     Another reason is, to be perfectly honest, history and society have not- and very well @MONTH1 never truly be- politically correct.  People take umbrage to certain words and consequently some libraries will remove the book featuring said words from their shelves.  After this is done, what have we really accomplished?       Have we made the world a better place by attempting to hide a part of history?  That is debatable, but by the same token, in school we must learn about the @CAPS1 despite the fact that it upsets many people.  We must learn about this because it was an important part in history that needs to be remembered in hopes that nothing so terrible as that will ever happen again.  So, if we learn about an entire subject which happened in another country but effected the entire world should we not learn about our own faults in history?  The times we have oppressed people, the terms we used so commonly we attempt to hide now.       Has it really helped us?  No, for until people recognize a problem and furthermore are reminded of how wrong it was they will not understand it.  Napoleon once said that history is a story written by the victor, but is victory so sweet after our history has been rewritten?     If everything that offends people is censored or taken away we will have nothing left.  For if one person is aloud to say what is and isn't acceptable then others will partake in this as well.  It would become a new fad and people would find a problem with just about anything.     So, essentially, by censoring works in libraries we are holding back the future generations from all that they could be.  We are forcing them to be ignorant of society's problems.  In the end we must ask ourselves, was it really worth it?  I remind you, a library is an invaluable resource."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4670	2	"Yes I do believe that certain books, movies, music, etc., should be removed. They should be put in a different position for children unable to find in the area. Because certain materials in the objects listed can start off bad behavior.        In order to keep the objects from being found from childern is to set them in a different area. Some where childern are unable to reach. like in high areas like the top of the shelf, or the closet, maybe the attic. For better safe keepings place the certain objects you feel that can give childern bad ideas in a personal safe. where no one is able to get things out.         It is important for some items to be seen, listened to, or watched for older people.For example, books can provide pictures for childern to do things that arn't right in there cerent age. Music can talk about stuff that that person done, and make that child want to do it because they might think its cool cause the artist does it. For the magazines they show articals of rapper, actors, and other famous people doing somthing wrong. showing a bad example for the child.Now for the materials they should be hidden in a place where no child would think to look at. Because the materials some times harm the child or maybe even put the child in the hospital.    From experience I have thouched or took some material I shouldn't have messed with and the outcome wasn't good. From that experience I've learned not to thouch with items I know not to mess with.     Thats why it is important to keep certain items from childern. Because the outcome maynot be what you wanted. serious actions might come from the objects, and later on come from the same child that either listed to, saw it, or looked at it. So make sure the items are safe from childern hands"	3	3		3	3	2	3

4682	2	"Censorship in libraries is a great issue in the world today. Many authors now use offensive methods and terms to persuade their audiences. However, many do not. All authors have the right to say what they wish but there is a limit to where the books should be placed and who should view them.     If libraries accept offensive types of magazines, books, music, movies, etc., they should most certainly be placed out of the reach of children. Like many libraries in the city, there is a section for children and a sperate section for adults. Any materials that are found offensive should be placed in a special section of the adult area and customers should be warned in some way. Since everyone has their own view of what is right and what is wrong, a special team should be placed in charge of keeping the offensive materials seperate. Those who borrow anything at the library @MONTH1 have the right to bring that special book or movie to the attention of those in charge. By sticking to this method, offensive materials can stay out of the hands of those who do not wish to see them.     Items containing vulgar language is unjust to most. There are still the majority, however, who engage in the oppertunity to view these materials. Everyone does have the right to do what they wish but, from personal experience and growing up in a home where I was taught right from wrong, people should be treated with dignity as well as respect. No matter our color, size, looks, or personalities, we are all created equally as our constitution says. Therefore, we should only view what would be considered just to all.

Others believe it to be a place where there is danger for minors and can be very innapropriate.  These two opinions can cause an intriguing argument.     People go to the library because they want to either get away, or just to be free and grab a nice book.  There are many books to choose from, but you need to be careful while browsing.  some books, although good, can be innapropriate to some ages, and that's when controversy spills.  Parents think the library is encouraging the check-out of innapropriate books, but this isn't all that true.  It's all about the placement of books, and that's what most librarians will tell you.  They didn't encourage the kid to check it out, but they have every right to.  It is also unknown that what is offensive to one person, might bring joy to another person maybe of a different race or ethnic background.     I think that these so-called offensive books or magazines that parents complain about, should not be removed from libraries.  There is a reason those books are there and they are not put up there to be offensive; so why take them down?  I think a way we can monitor these kids to stay away from books their parents believe can be harmful to them is by making a rule stating that a child must be present with an adult in certain sections.  This will not only stop the fact that kids checkout books much innapropriate for them, but it might also make the parents stop complaining and the controversy will end.          People need to stop looking at the library as a place that brings negativity, but as a place for giving children joy.  Remember, it was built for those who enjoy reading and so people can have a place to do so.  Why complain? Find the positives in what it brings instead of looking down on it.  Bring back the feelings of what the library brought to you when you were a child."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4691	2	"What race are you? What religion are you? What have you been taught? Almost anything like these could be considered offensive. So should these types of things be taken out of libraries?     No, these types of things are everywhere. You just can't get away from them. Today you can find so many offensive television shows and commercials. For example the commercials for @CAPS1 gum with that @CAPS2 woman, some people might consider that offensive. You might ask, '@CAPS3', well there might be a person who has a diesease who can't get that 'clean feeling' and always has bad breath. That person might take offense to these commercials. Another example might be television shows, like @ORGANIZATION1. Some @CAPS4 and just other races get offended by these types of things. Does that really mean we should get rid of them though?     People everywhere are somehow offended by something, the world isn't perfect. Even if we did take out these types of offensive material in libraries, it could still be seen. So whats the point?          If you tried to take it all out, like everywhere in the world everything would be crazy. There is no such thing as a perfect world, I believe if there was people would go crazy. For example in the movie '@CAPS5 @CAPS6,' the main character finds a town that is suppose to resemble 'The @CAPS7 @CAPS8' or a perfect society. In the town at first everything is nice, but then everyone is so perfect that he can't stand it and leaves.      The best thing to do is let these materials stick around because there is nothing you can do to get them gone from everywhere else. Also they help kids learn, if you keep them locked up and not knowing anything, then how far are they going to get in life?     So should these things go away or not? What do you think?"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4697	2	"I am a student from @CAPS1. I wanted to let you know  that there have been some great and interesting books that I have read from the schools library and the public library as well. The only problem is that there have been some complaints from my friends and families about the books. Not only that but I've also seen books that are not appropriate for children to be reading. I just wanted to let you know this because I was kind of thinking that taking books out wouldn't be a good idea for them to do. I think so because without books less people would want to read and not learn.      To begin with, I wanted to talk about the complaints that friends have told me. One of them was that at the school there had not been good books to read and that they want to take most of them out and replace them with the ones they like. I was thinking that if they did that they would be the only ones to go to the library because it is only there choice and not everyones. So what I'm trying to say is that if we don't have good books students won't be going to the library. If they don't get books then they won't do well in school which is something that will affect the school.     Furthermore about the complaints was that one of my own family member had seen  a young girl looking at a book that was not appropriate for her at the public library. So instead of taking those types of books out they should be put into a room that is strictly not for children to go in. They should do that because if it were to be taken out then that book wouldn't ever be used again. Also another reason is that If they were to be taken out, then another peson might need information over the topic of the book and wouldn't be able to find it because it isn't there. That is why I thing those types of books should be in a special room intead of them being taken out.     Finally, as I had somewhat mentioned earlier is that books are truly important. That is why I go against taking books out that are not favored by others. If a person doesn't like a certain book/ magazine  then they should just request the book/ magazie that they want to read. By doing that then the book that arn't being used could actually be used by someone else that is intersted in it. So if we keep all our book, then more students and people would go and read.      In conclusion, people might say that taking out book is better than keeping them. Well in the way I see it, they are wrong because keeping them is better. It is better because  someday those books can be useful nomatter how old they are. If they were inappropriate books like metioned earlier, they should be put away in a good place. If there arn't enough interesing ones then requesting one is another way to do it. That is why I think that taking out books from the shelves is wrong and they should do watever in order to not let books go to waist"	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4698	2	"There are things in this world that are relative. Censorship is one of them. Relative means that one person has a different view than that of another. Censorship is when a person or organization in authority does not allow people to see things that they believe are inappropriate. One phrase that is very important to censorship is 'things that they believe.' @CAPS1 is inappropriate to one person could be deemed viewable to another. This should not be decided by one person or even one group that believes they know @CAPS1 is socially acceptable or politically correct. Censorship in libraries are not a good thing.     @PERSON3 and @CAPS2 walk into a library, and there is a magazine on the rack that depicts a person standing over a two hundred pound, twenty four point, state record, whitetail deer with with a gun in their hand. @PERSON3 is a firm believer in providing for his family and the rights given to an individual in the second ammendment of the @LOCATION1 constitution. Even if that means killing an animal for its resources. For some there is pride in harvesting an animal and knowing that they provided that meat. @PERSON3 will see the magazine as an opportunity. He might learn tips from the magazine, or find some new gear that he thinks could be useful.      @CAPS2 on the other hand is a conservative. She believes killing is wrong and inhumane. She goes to the store and buys her meat from the freezer section. @CAPS2 prefers not to know where her meat came from. She will view this magazine as inappropriate. Again, censorship is relative to the person looking over the material. Does that mean that just because @CAPS2 thinks the magazine is inappropriate, it should be taken off of the shelf so that someone like @PERSON3 can not read it, appreciate it, and gain knowledge from it? That choice is up to @CAPS2 not to read the magazine, not to the librarian. @CAPS2 is responsible for her own views and choices. She is entitled to them. @PERSON3 is entitled as well. Leave the choice to the reader.     Over in the book section there are @PERSON1 and @PERSON2. @PERSON1 is a fanatic for science and history. @PERSON2 has a preference for religious books that explain the theology behind some of the things the world says and things of his religion. At the end of the row, on top of the shelf sits a book on the topic of evolution. @PERSON1 belives this theory and sees the book as interesting. @PERSON2 looks at the book and thinks to himself, 'That stuff is not true. Why would anyone waste their time reading it.' Does that mean that the book should be taken off the shelf because @PERSON2 will not read it. @PERSON2 should just walk away from it. If he chooses not to, that is up to @PERSON2. Leave that choice to @PERSON2.     Up at the desk there are the librarians.They have their views and opinions and are entitled to them as well. But the books, music, movies, and magazines that are displayed  for checking out should not be chosen because he or she likes them or opposes them, but because someone might be looking for the information in that material. If the choice is left to them that material might not be available to the reader that needs it.     Censorship is a terrible thing for libraries. It takes material away from people that can be useful. Censorship, along with many other things is relative. @CAPS1 one person @MONTH1 deem inappropriate could be viewed as totally fine with another person. Based on moral values, character, and opinions developed with progression of life, people have made judgements on @CAPS1 is appropriate or unacceptable. That choice to look at that magazine, read that book, or listen to that song should be left up to them, not made for them."	5	4		5	4	4	4																		
4700	2	"All things in the world are not strictly black and white. Every person is different, with varying ideas. So when some people are certain that a specific word or topic should be restricted, there will always be another person to say the exact opposite. Sometimes, what's found as 'vulgar' can only be introduced with the intent of education. Also, this ties in with something our country was founded on, which is freedom of the speech, and the press.      Magazines, music, books and movies are mainly for entertainment. Everyone who reads or watches something will take it in differently, and it will have a varying effect. Let's say there is a @NUM1-year-old girl who just had her first day of high school. While at lunch, she slipped and dropped her tray of food. Later that day while she's alone reading her favorite magazine, she's reading an article about embarrassing stories, where one girl accidentally walked into a boys' restroom. Some parents @MONTH1 deem this inappropriate, but it has made the young girl feel better about her situation.      It's human to mess up and act crazy; we aren't perfect by nature. So when we see errors made into comedies and dramas by any form of media, it's human to realize that we aren't the only ones who undergo these events. To censor books and televisions would be like claiming nothing bad happens. Not to say that a novel written about brutal murder that contains sexual references should be given to a little kid, but it should not be pulled from the shelf all together.      The topic of censorship in schools is also a very sensitive one, especially with younger kids. As Katherine Paterson pointed out, if every parent had the right to remove a book that they thought was not suitable, then eventually there would be nothing left. Many parents are uneasy with the thought of their child being taught things like sexual education, but on the other hand, there are also the parents who appreciate it. They do so not because it saves them time, but because certain explicit topics - to an extent - can help someone mature if it's done in a controlled environment.      Years ago, it was not uncommon to see censorship in the media. It could range from saying 'intercourse' to replace 'sex' or it could be something like extreme propoganda. There's a reason that our consitution protects freedom of speech. No matter how appauling someone @MONTH1 find a topic, it usually has some type of informative purpose. Otherwise, it probably wouldn't have gotten issued.      Choosing what is and isn't offensive is a matter of opinion. As previously stated, no two humans are exactly the same, and their opinions won't be either. So this means that if one person out of a group is allowed to dispose of or censor whatever they find necessary, it must be recognized that some portion of the remaining people will be unsatisfied. This is usually where people will claim that the law protects their freedom of speech. In the end, the media is largely for entertainment. It provides numerous shows and articles, with a huge array of topics. This goes to show that if one should find something offensive, it doesn't mean they have to rip it off the shelves and complain; it simply means they have the opportunity look elsewhere"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4703	2	"When picking a book, music, movie, and magazines from the library it's always a hard decision because you @MONTH1 be like me and want to read more than one book at a time. Books that are found offensive are more interesting than just plain boring books. So why would anybody take books off the shelf for being offensive?       When children pick books from the library you want to make sure their kids books and you @MONTH1 also want to check to see if their educational.  You definitely wouldn't want a little kid getting ahold of an adult book or a book that is found offensive in some way. So have an adult section and a kids section.      When we walk into a library full of books, theirs a huge variety of any kind of books. We would lower the use of going to the library if books were takin off the shelves because their wouldn't be any use of going. If your not going to find a book there, why go to the library anymore?       The last reason to not take books off the shelfs is people that can not afford to buy a book from anywhere obviously come to the library to borrow a book. So taking books away would just limit their learning and would not be very benificial to them.      The only reason that I would find it okay to take offensive books and anything else off shelves is for childrens sake and safety. If the library's are thinking about taking offensive books off shelves, they should have a public vote to see what everyone else thinks about it. If they decide to take books off the shelves, why not just have an adult section in the library? Anybody that is @NUM1 years of age or older could be in there. So make finding a book easier and don't take our offensive books completely away from us"	4	3		4	4	4	4																		
4705	2	"Certain material that are made to offend people should be removed from shelves everywhere. I am against any material that are offensive to someone or something else. The three main reasons I am against this is because it is wrong to offend others, offending others can lead to personal issues, and offending others or something else will eventually tire out.           To simply write a book or a magazine, or make a movie just to offend someone or something is wrong. People should always treat others the way that they would like to be treated. For someone to make negative lyrics about a person or something says something about the person who made that song. Maybe that person has personal issues. In order for that person to ignore their personal issues, they make fun of someone else.     Offending other people can lead to personal problems. How? If someone steadily talks about you or, on a daily basis, offends you, people can get depressed. They can start believing that they are nothing. I remember a girl in the eighth grade told everyone that I was a 'garden tool' and that I would do anything for a piece of change. She also made a song, taunting me everyday about how I looked. She actually recorded it and passed it out at school. People heard it, and like followers, they started taunting me, too. I soon became depressed. I got so bad to the point that I was suicidal. I thought the world would be a better place without me. I had to go see a shrink to get over those thoughts. What other people do to you or say about you can have a bad effect on them.       Last but not least, people will eventually get tired of hearing bad things about someone. The victim will get tired of being teased or talked about. People would stop listening to that negative garbage. If people stop supporting that degrading stuff, then the author wouldn't have anything to write about. The singer wouldn't have anything to sing about. Their career will have gone down the drain because there is no future in offending others.     There are many reasons why offensive materials should be removed from the shelves in libraries, stores, and everywhere else. These negative comments will get nowhere in life. As I brought out in my body, it's simply wrong to offend others, it can lead to personal issues, and it will eventually tire out or get old. Nothing good comes from making people feel bad. So once again, these negative materials should be abolished everywhere."	4	4		4	3	3	3																		
4706	2	"In my personal opinon I think that those books that have things that you don't want to read or you think are offensive should stay. It's not like that person that is offended by it has to read it.            Say you are in the library and you see a book that you think offends you. You think to your self that book should be removed from the library just because you think it is offensive, but you have to think in other peoples shoes.     Just becaus you think a book is offensive doesn't mean that everyone else will think it is. That is why they have age groups and grade levels that are set up so a kid who likes picture books will not get stuck with a book that has curse words or other things that are meant for adults. Same concept with movies, magazines, music, and etc.     Take this for example. I was walking through the library when I saw a book called @CAPS1 the @ORGANIZATION1, and I thought to myself that looks like a stupid book and I wouldn't want to read it. I think that they should throw this book away. Now lets think does that sound fair. Maybe that is some kids favorite book and when he comes in there the next day it is gone.      What about this, lets say you go in to look for your favorite book and you find out that someone found it offensive or someone just didn't like it as much as you did so they threw it away. Doesn't seem to fair does it.     In conclusion that is what i think about removing books that are offensive or some people just don't like. I think they should leave it on there because we shouldn't remove it based on our personal opinon."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4711	2	"Censorship in the @CAPS1     @CAPS2, what is offensive to some @MONTH1 not be to others. So how do we know when expressing ourselves in an artistic manner that we've gone to far? We don't and thats why censorship is such a controversial topic.      In the music industry recently there has been messages in songs and music videos that aren't the best suited for teenagers. Being a teenager is a time of constant turmoil in one's life, you are required to make decisions that will define you as a person. When songs out there are about drug use and other crimes teens see them as cool things and follow along cause they see them as everyday activities that can do no harm but little do they know that they are wrecking their life by doing this, so I somewhat agree with censorship in that kind of thing.     In literature and art things take a more serious tone than in music and other media. With literature it's about conveying ones thoughts and feelings about a story or other subject. In art you express yourself vissually on a canvas or abstractly through other materials and forms, but in both ways you express your feelings and emotins. So censoring these would in turn censor one voice and emotions. When you take away a man's voice and emotions you are left with an empty shell of a person who will never know life to the fullest.     As time has changed I have found that people have also changed. When @PERSON1 uses the '@CAPS3-word' in some of his literary works it didn't offend people at the time, but now times have changed. Now it's not ok that @PERSON1 used this word but on the other hand it's ok for rappers and others to say it every other word in their music. so how do we know what's offensive and what's not? well it's all from the reader, listener, or viewer's point of view.     These days parents try to sheild their children from the outside world and make it seem that it's all rainbows and butterflies by censoring things the children might be subject to read, hear, or see in their day to day lives. This does not solve the problems in the world there will always be war, crime, and death no matter how hard we try to stop it as long as there's 'good' there will always be 'bad'.     All loyalties aside in my honest opinion I believe censorship in the @CAPS1 is a bad idea and will never work to solve actual problems with the world. It will just cover them up just like the dialouge or image they so badly want to go away."	4	5		4	4	4	4																		
4713	2	"Do I believe certain material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive?  No, just because a book or song or magazine article or movie is offensive does not mean that we should have the right to take it off the shelves.  Sure we have a right to remove that book but there are a lot things that are going to offend people.      Just because someone comes across an offensive book at the library doesn't mean that they should have to go through so much work to get it removed off the shelf.  Its not worth the trouble for just a book that you could just simply look past and look at other books.  If it was possible for anyone to just take a book off a shelf because they thought it was offensive we would have a lot of empy book stores.  Because face it people can and will be offended easily if something they believe, like religion, is being made fun of in a book that they had read about.       We all get offended but just move on from it and find something different.  We are not forced to read that book or listen to that song or look at the magazine.  We have a choice and the choice can be to move on and read or look at something different, more positive, or go through the process to get it removed and taken off the shelf.  You never know someone else might think that maybe that article in that magazine was benefitial or relating.  So it should not be up to one person, but if a whole community has a problem with a book then I can see removing it can be an option"	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4721	2	"All materials in a library are for the public. This is why we have public libraries. Children are most likely with an adult when they go to a library and are normaly looking for books or activities that they would enjoy at their age. If a costomer in a library finds a book or item that they find offensive then it most likely was not an accident. Materials in libraries are for the public and should not be taken away just because a few find it offensive.     Children are very suspicious in libraries because they know that adult material is also in the library. This is where an adult comes in and supervises the child. Some parents don't mind that children see these images or read innapropriate information, but on the other hand some parents do. If someone comes across information that would be offensive they were most likely looking for it and are aware of where it is. Everyone in a library has the right to take or read what they want. There is no sign outside the door that says only certain ages of people can visit certain areas of the store.      It is the parent or gardians decision to allow or not alow their child to visit the more innapropriate areas of the store. Everyone has different rules and those rules are to be followed, but it is not the libraries job to keep track and watch those children to make sure they stay in their designated area.     There is a place for everything in a library and most of the locations are pretty obvious as to what kind of information is held there. For instance, more adult and innapropriate material is located in the back of the store. Adult matter is held back there to make it more private and harder for little children to discover and to be alittle more private to people who are reading it. Childrens' books and movies are usually loctaed in the front of the store so it draws their attention more. Children @MONTH1 never know what else is in the store if they dont go looking for it. Children should be acompanied by an adult if the adult believes their child would wander off looking for innapropriate materal.     Other material that could be offensive could not only be to children, it could be offensive to different races or cultures as well. Also if a person finds that information, they were most likely looking for it. Everything is labeled in a library and something doesn't just pop up out of nowhere if you where not looking for it.      Overall material in a store is public and for anyone who comes into the store. Children should be watched if they are suspicous and wander in the library. If someone does not want to find this informatin or think it would be offensive, then they should not go near the area which it is located"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4739	2	"I believe that censorship in libraries can be a good thing, but can go too far. Removing movies and magazines that contain pointless offensive material from the shelves could be a good thing. If those are removed I do not think that people would care that much. Removing those small things, however, could grow into a bigger problem. It has to be decided how far is too far when removing objects from the shelves.     It all starts with a bad magazine that has a bad picture of a movie star doing something offensive with text surrounding it being pointlessly judgemental. A parent sees his or her kid reading this at the library and they do not believe it is appropriate so they complain and the magazine is taken off the shelf. Then a movie arises that is offensive and it is taken off the shelf. Pretty soon everyone is comming in with minor complaints about many different things and almost everything has someone who wants it banned.     Even if there was a set limit on what qualifies as able to be banned people would still complain until what they want happens. If the government has all these complaints they might just shut down the libraries to avoid looking over every 'offensive' piece of literature, film, or artwork. The original purpose being to block out offensive meterial ends with the realization that everything is offensive to somebody. Even what might be considered a great piece of work by most could be considered an abomination by some.     In the end a library should not be given the right to censor anything. The things that should be censored are a very small percentage and it is not worth the risk. Books that are offensive to some serve as inspiration to others. Libraries were made to give people the chance to be inspired. The library should not have the right to take inspiration away from the reader's hand."	3	4		3	3	4	3																		
4743	2	"Everyone has a preference in works of literature, such as books, magazines, movies or music. Different types of these works of literature are significant to each person. If everyone had the right to completely remove one piece of work that displeases them, then no works would remain. Therefore, I believe no materials such as books, music, movies and magazines should be removed from public libraries or other public places. Everyone has unique ideas, necesities and preferences.     A few years ago, I had a classmate who had different ideas from a myriad of people on religious persecution. He hated the idea of mixing people of different religions into one place. He wrote a paper containing all of his ideas on how the world should function in terms of religion. He tried to publish it, but did not succeed because his work was considered offensive. Even though I disagree with his ideas, I do not think his work should have been rejected. There could have been people in the world who did agree with his thoughts and would have been interested to read them. There could even have been ideas in his paper that could've helped countries solve various problems. I believe it is unfair that his paper was rejected.     People have different necesities based on what they have to accomplish. For example, I was reading a book last @DATE1 about a girl who was doing a project on racism. She went to the library to search for a book about apartheid in @LOCATION1 but couldn't find anything. She asked a librarian if there were any, but the librarian told her that books such as those were considered offensive in that local library and she would have to search elsewhere. I believe that it is unjust because the girl @MONTH1 not have had anywhere else to go to get the information about her project. She should've had the right to access the information that she needed for the project to prevent her from failing.     Another reason that no books should be removed is simply because everyone has unique preferences. In the world, there are books that certain people would enjoy more than others. Literature should be abled to be used for the purpose of entertainment and convenience. If I were to go to a library now, I would find many selections that correspond to my ideal novel or magazine. Every person should have that right. If people start removing materials that are offensive to them, then nothing on the shelves would remain and not one person would have the right to have access to the materials they desire.     In this world, diversity exists everywhere. People have and always will want, need and desire different things. Works of literature are just one of them. If people begin to eliminate offensive materials based on everyone's frustration or displeasures, then no books will remain on the public shelves. Therefore, materials such as books, music, movies and magazines should never be removed from public places. These things are necessities to the world."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4747	2	"When you walk into the heavenly sanctuary that is our library, you have opened yourself up to a vast wealth of knowledge that is available to you at the click of a mouse, the push of a button, or the turn of a page. There are those of a select few, however, who are under the paradigm that not all of this information is for all eyes. They feel it should be locked away, as if it were some eyesore. Allow me to address this view with retaliation and distaste on a number of levels in the following document.     I am a musician. Music is my passion. My creative gears are forever turning. Often I look to other artists' works for inspiration, and the one place to get that music is, you guessed it, the library. How disappointed am I when I find that the music I want has been removed for being explicit. It was not the lyrics or foul message I sought, but the beautiful melodies and harmonies therein! It does not do well to isolate media without first seeing the good that lies in it and the strong feelings it has to convey.     We @MONTH1 discard the world's greatest novel because of racial discrepancies or wizardry. We @MONTH1 throw away a moving song because of its lyrics. We @MONTH1 trash a movie after only reading the title, never even giving it a chance. How fair is this? Even now there @MONTH1 be those who refuse to read your newspaper because of their disagreements with one, individual editor. That is no fair crop in my right mind.     I implore you, as a public, as people of sound mind and stout hearts to reconsider the censorship of those works which have a clear and true message and were forged for the benefit of our humankind. All things have a story to tell. A friend of mine once said to me, that there were three ways we could absorb things that we find undesirable. We can reject, we can ignore, or we can absorb and interpret. To reject leaves you no smarter. To ignore leaves you in fear. However, to absorb, you gain new knowledge, be it of a new culture or new person. Everything must be taken with a grain of salt. Let us watch something we find immoral and then take the time to understand why it is immoral, for it is these things that define us. If you do not see what is or is not right, who is to say what is truly ethical? We need material of substance in our libraries, for our exposure and for our fathoming of new knowledge in our modern world"	5	6		5	4	4	4																		
4749	2	"When you think of a book do you think happy kids books, or mysterious dark books? What if I was to say offensive books? Most magazines, music, books, and movies you take off the shelf today are not so happy or mysterious that you @MONTH1 think.      When I think of a movie I want to watch I think of something that im going to injoy; not something im going to shut off in the middle of it. What if you pick a movie that @MONTH1 look good from the front cover and you read the back and it sounds good but when you get home to watch it with your little sister or brother its the exact opposite. Do you turn it in? Do you turn it off and waist your money not doing anything about it?     Offensive books, movie, music, and magazines should be cleared from the store. If your not going to finish it, then why is it there? Im not going to watch or read a book if its not going to make me feel good as a person or make myself feel good. If people can sit there and write it, act it or play it then we should be able to speak our oppinion on it if its good or not.      People have feelings, if there going be hurt by something we should enjoy then take them off the shelves. Do something about it. We all should have the success for doing something for other people, and if not that then for ourselves."	3	3		3	3	3	3																		
4755	2	"Why do we have books out there that are viewed as offensive? If they are inapropriate, why do we keep putting those books, magazines, movies, and the big one, music out there in the world? Let me tell you why, because people in @LOCATION1 unfortunatly, have grown out of @CAPS1-duty time, @PERSON1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and many other nonoffensive shows. But with the shows, books, and movies played today are very inapropriate to the younger viewers.      @DATE1 @TIME1 cartoons are over, at least the good cartoon like @CAPS4 and @PERSON3, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS5, ect, these cartoons, that I used to watch, that taught me how to be @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and @CAPS8 have faded away. With the cartoons out now that are supposed to be good for children, all show @CAPS22 the same thing and that @CAPS22 @CAPS9, @CAPS10, @CAPS11, and all the other @NUM1 deadly sins. They show these without explaning anything that can help the child in life, and that @CAPS22 @CAPS12.     We can @CAPS23 take books off the shelves, make directors' quit directing, rappers' quit rapping, or make the pornoghraphy stop but we can restrict it to a point. It will always be out there weather it @CAPS22 by the blackmarket or the adult stores.Thankfully there are ways around letting your children watch these shows. Restrictions on the television, make the offencive books, magazines in a library to a(n) restricted area to where no one can enter without being @NUM2 years old.     There @CAPS22 a lot to say about the music out there. It can be and @CAPS22 very offensive. I was born and raised on the old fasion country music and unfortunatly country music has gone to the dogs. Sorry to say but the change in music started at the begining of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS13, with the hippies. While they where all hopped up on @CAPS14, @CAPS15, and @CAPS16, they brought to life the new @CAPS17 and @CAPS18. So it has been here over @NUM3 years it @CAPS22 @CAPS23 going away. All we can do @CAPS22 hope our children does @CAPS23 turn on the radio that @CAPS22 tuned into that crap and say '@CAPS19 that sound like good music.'     With the pornoghraphic magazines, they have been around since @PERSON2 was in her prime. It @CAPS22 @CAPS23 going to stop whatever we do. All we can do @CAPS22 block it out of our lives. We can try and keep it out of our childrens eyes but it will @CAPS23 help they will always be known to this world.     I think we should move these things to another part of the library, that only adults can get to if that can be done in the library. Then we will move onto the music, and then the shows. Remember it will always be out there, all we can do as @CAPS20 @CAPS22 try to keep it out of reach of our children. We can't stop it but we can try and keep it out of there eyes. With the will power of @CAPS20 it CAN be done.FAILURE @CAPS22 @CAPS23 @CAPS24 @CAPS25!!!"	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4757	2	"I believe that if that book, music, or magazines  that is offensive and people don't like it then maybe they should remove themself from the librarie. tThere are alot of things out there that people like to read and listen too. mmaybe for those people who do not like it they can go to an other librarie. There are alot of them around us.      If a person did not like what they seen at that librarie then why go back? It could be offensive to some people but not all. So if people try to fight about removing them then the people that like them are going to be mad because they like to read it and they have a good time. Like i said before if they do not like it they then there are plenty more librarie's that probably will not have it there.     Libraries should be able to put what they want on their shelfs. They could put in it in the back and whoever wants it and go ask for it. Or they could go put something up and make it where you know whats over there and if you do not like then do go in. There is more then just one shelf in a librarie, i you don't like it then don't go over there. If there is a sign up then there will be one reason for you to go over there and get all offended and complan about it.      You got to think about other people in this too. Peolpe that do like it and go to the libraries to read books, listen ti music, rent a move, read magazines, they be able to do it anymore. Then they will be mad and then that just an other fight. Would anyone what that much drama, I wouldn't. That would be to much for me and hanle. People are  now these days. No one will know what i person would do if they don't get there book, music, movies, or magazines. How would you feel if you lost that? Probably not to happy.     I believe that that books, music, movies, and magazines should stay on the shelfs of the librarie. Just becuse a few people don't like it and want to fight for it, should really sitt back and look at what they are doing. There are more then just one librarie in this world. If you don't like the stuff that librarie is putting on it's shelfs then go find a new one. It's not worth fighting over and spenting all that money on that not alot of people have these days just to fight about what is on a librarie shelf. Not even worth it. Like i said before you don't like it. don't look at it, read it. listen to it, nothing. Just stay away from it and you will not get offended."	4	4		4	4	4	4																		
4758	2	"Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, I don't think so, these items should stay on the shelves for the appropriate ages. If you are over the age of eighteen you should be able to pick and chose to what ever topic they want. If you are under the age of eighteen there should be an age requirement and also require parent consent.      For those under eighteen when they get a library membership they should have to verify thier date of birth, and what thier parent srequest their child to be able to read, play, or watch. Librarys and book stores should put a rating on the magazines or books, just like movies. This will promote less parents of anger for thier children listening to music or reading inappropriate books, magazines, or video games. Now if books stores sell these books to underage children without parent consent, there can be charges pressed. It would be pretty much the same thing as selling liquor, or cigarettes to a minor.     From my observations with my little brother, my mother chose to let him play inappropriate video games. For instance these games consisted of violence, sex, drugs, and foul language. In result of this I notice that my brother does not obey, or treat my mother with the respect as he should. He also misbehaves in school constantly. That is just one example of the many I know of.     Even if the parent gives permission for thier child to watch offensive movies, play inappropriate video games, or read certain books that are not suitable for his/her age, they should still have to be a certain age. Some parents make poor decisions on thier parenting, and it will reflect them later in life.     So my overall opinion would be no. Keep the books on the shelf for the people that are mature enough to watch, read, or play. If they limit the selling of these items to minors, these children @DATE1 will not have as many crimes all together. There would be less violence, and drug offenses or abuse. Keep this all in mind.                                                                 @ORGANIZATION1"	4	4		4	3	4	3																		
4768	2	"Books, movies, magazines, music, etc., make up a huge part of our entertainment system in our lives today. Whether it be informational or just purely for entertainment, many forms of entertainment are found in your local library today, whereas in the past most libraries only contained books. Although, our entertainment today is much different then it was back then and will be much different than it will be in the future.      In today's society books, magazines, music, movies, and so on can be found in your local library, and contain many different types of material. Some material could be informational about our solar system or about the human body. Other material could be a fiction story filled with action, horror, or love. Some material could also be filled with true, life changing, and inspritaional storries. Which ever it @MONTH1 be, these types of things @MONTH1 come off as offensive to some people more than others and @MONTH1 not be apporpriate for younger ages.     Certain books, movies, magaizines, music, ect., containing offensive, inappropriate, or rude material shouldn't be banned from libraries, just because those younger than adults should not read them, or becuase those who dislike the material believe that that material does not belong in the library. Generally most libraries are quite large and organized into various sections throughout the building. One area might be for fiction books and another for non-fiction books, another area could be for childrens books, and another for magazines, movies, music, ect., all based on different types and genres. Simply do this for those materials that should only be read by adults and not for children or teens. Take the books that @MONTH1 contain offensive material, or @MONTH1 be inappropriate for those younger than adults and place them in their own divided section in the library. When a book from that section is being checked out merely ask for an @CAPS1 from the person checking that book out to make sure that they are of age. This can also apply to movies, magazines, music, and so on that are placed in that section.     Some materials found in libraries that @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to others. Taking those offensive materials out of the library won't benefit everyone and @MONTH1 disappoint some of the people who don't find that material offensive. Placing these certain materials in their own section is the best way to go to benefit everyone.      As you can see just because one person @MONTH1 find certain material in magazines, books, music, movies, ect., offensive, rude, or inappropriate, doesn't mean that everyone else does. It also doesn't mean you should completely take out and get rid of all the materials that are found to contain offensive or innapropraite material. Dividing those specific materials into their own section, and regulating who @MONTH1 check them out is really the best way to go. It benefits everyone at best so that those who want to read that material can still go to their library and check out that book, magazine, and so on, and those who wish to not have anything to do with that certain material don't have to worry about finding material that is offensive or inappropriate, because they will be in their own divided section"	3	4		3	4	4	4																		
4773	2	The author is writting about taking books off that the adult's don't want the book's the  end they won't have book's to. They take out the books that have bad words or pictures in them. Well I don't really belive that they should take them out becuase they het intresting well some of them do. Well I'm not a fan of reading I dont really like reading but I have to anyway and I dont think it should be taking out.          I don't really think it should be taken out for some reasons it's better to have them so kids can read and learn bout the pictures. Some book's aren't that bad to kid's like to elementary kid's the only book's they like are the one's with picture's in them. The @CAPS1 school and middle school kid's like the chapter kind of book's and intresting book's. The parent's would like them to have educational book's that will help the kid's learn new word's and school related stuff.          The book's the adult's want are the kind that have meaning to like have alot of knowledge and school realated stuff. They want there kid's to learn about what they are reading. But yea i din't think they should take out the bbok's that they have they shoul'd just leave them for the kid's becuase there atleast are educational to them. So the adult's would have more educational student's to relly on	3	2		3	3	2	3

11841	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy, enjoyable, and worth living. I say happy because they had family to be with, and other friends to help them if anything. I say enjoyable because the author talks about how they (main character) had the first birthday and first friend. I would enjoy all my birthdays if I was that person and also my first friend. I also said worth living because they had food on their table everyday. And nothing in the memoir said anything about struggling. This is why I explain the mood as happy, enjoyable, and worth living."	2	1		2

11850	5	"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a very happy mood in his memoir. One reason the mood is happy is because of the setting. Narciso describes his house and says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back-drop to life in our warm home."" The author describes a home filled with many good friends and good memories. Anothe reason is how grateful the author sounds. It says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" While they had to leave everything behind they did it for their kids and for a new life. The author is happy that they did. Also, the author credits the house with giving him a family. @CAPS1 says, ""It was here that I learned the real definition of the word 'family.'

Most people who would live in a tiny apartment in the city would say that it was to small and cramped, while they wished for a mansion on the ocean, but Narciso was perfectly happy being in that environment. The way she described it, there were always great smells, wounderful music, and great people around all of the time. Narciso said the man people who contributed the most to her wounderful experience in New Jersey were her parents. They supported and cared for her at the same time they were strugling for money. They never showed sadness and they loved and cared for her. Even though Narciso lived in a small apartment in the city, she and her family show that you can make the best out of any situation."	3	2		3

People today are losing there jobs & homes and they have nobody to go to, but the Rodriguez family had a place to go. ""Countless extaded family members came & went- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet.

This also shows us that he is proud of his culture and who he is as a person. @PERSON2 quotes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice.""

In his neighborhood, many people were the victims of racism, so they all came together to be a stronger whole.

His parents taught him that anybody you can trust his family, anybody that you help because you know they will do the same for you.

The mood is is happy and greatfull for what Narciso learned. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" In the parenthesis it emphasizes the love Narciso has for Cuban music even more.

First you should always be happy no matter what culture your in. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" located in paragraph @NUM1. It doesnt matter what culture you are in. Second, be happy from where you come from. ""I was born into this simple house, situated, in a two-family, blond-brick, building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey,"" located in paragraph @NUM2. You should be happy from what town you are from. Lastly, never forget who really matters. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" located in paragraph @NUM3. You should always be thankful to you parents. In conclusion these moods are the examples of the memoir."	3	2		3

There is love and achievement in the mood as well because Narciso loved his friends, family, neighborhood, home and childhood. The achievement was of his parents comming over to @LOCATION1 and starting a better life. Anyone would be happy with a childhood like that because being surrounded by the ones you love and being proud of you and your family is what is important."	2	3		3

The mood of the memoir was happy up lifting when he talked about how his parents helped others and they always had people in their house. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The mood of the memoir was brought to life when the author described the rich culture in his home. ""traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.... Unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" I think the addition in the parentheses make it light and airy. His tone is thrilled and thankful for his rich culture. The author's tone was very sweet, I think, when thanking his parents. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me... and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.... and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" The mood of the memoir is warm, happy, and sweet, thanks to the author."	4	4		4																					
11933	5	The mood changed throughout the memoir. First the mood started off depressing by saying in Cuba they had a one room furnished apartment. That when they came to @LOCATION1 and @PERSON1 could afford to move into a modest three-room apartment. Next mood was inspirring. It was inspirring because the parents were a poor family and they found a way to move out of cuba. Also because his parents were selflessly getting out of cuba so there children could have a better place to live. Lastly there was a mood of family. They were honest hardworking immagrants who extended a hand to help people in need. Also they were always had Alegria graced at the dinner table for meals and had the surrogated grandparents Sergio and @CAPS1 there too. The mood changed throughout the whole memior from depressing to inspirring and to family which it always was about.	3	2		3

11941	5	"The mood created by the author is warmth. First off, in paragraph two, it says how his family would always cook food and turn on the cuban music. It also says how the smell of the food would fill the house. In paragraph four, it says how they would always have family members over for dinner. Some of the family members they would have were Grandparents, Aunts, @CAPS1, and cousins. The last reason the mood is warmth is because he said in paragraph seven, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That means that before they lived there, it was just three rooms; however, once they moved in, they turned it into a place where friends and family could gather and have fun."	3	3		3																					
11943	5	"In Narciso Rodriguez, his own memoir, his own memoir, we are told about his child hood. Narciso affects the mood by describing the setting. He writes ""could afford to into a modest three room apartment..."" in pharagraph @NUM1.  This gives you a humble feeling from the very beggining of the reading. In pharagraph @NUM2, he writes ""passionate Cuban music filled the air..."". This made me think of mexican culture. Narciso writes things like these throught his memoir. These lines give the mood of modesty and rich Cuban culture Narciso also writes about his birthday, and faimly. The parts that he writes about faimly give you a feeling of unity. These are the lines/phrases Narciso uses to give his memoir mood."	3	2		3

It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immagrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" @CAPS1 shared the feeling of acceptance because although they were all from different cultures and ethnicities, they all learned how to become one ""family"" in a rascist enviroment. @CAPS1 shared how his parents made the difficult decision to move to the new place leaving loved ones behind for their children's better future (@CAPS2 @NUM2). @CAPS1 showed a lot of admiration for his parents based on what they do for him and how they always have other family members or neighbors around the kitchen table for meals.

As the author describes the parents moving into the United States, it tells how they had to leave behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. The motivation to do so reveals the parents faith in creating a home just as good as before. The author is very grateful as he admires his parents faith that has traveled so far over time. Rodríguez believes his parents have more courage then anyone and have expressed so much generosity upon him and others to always have their arms open to help others. It was the parents faith at the struggles would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."	2	3		3

Over all the mood was fairley simple, fun. In the last sentence it stated that the author had said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""

12118	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. It is showing all kinds of memories the family has at one house As it says in the memoir, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. It's saying that a house is a house and it doesn't mean much to people and anyone can go there. But a home is where you live, is where you grow up and have all the memories, it's just a better place"	2	2		2																					
12121	5	The mood in the memoir is very calm. It's not very tense and depressing. An example of it being calm is in paragraph @NUM1 when the words are in the parentheses it's like the person is talking to you. Also how it Just states facts and a @CAPS1. Another example of it being calm is how the @CAPS1 is happy and not sad. It has a flow to it.	1	1		1

When I hear about someone being that @CAPS1 it makes me think how times have changed from whe Narciso was growing up in the @NUM1's. He was so greatful and happy when compaired to now he has nothing. But he was abel to show all his gratude with the deepest heart warming simpathyall in all @CAPS2 learned from his parents and knew that family was the most important thing you can have.	2	2		2																					
12139	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very warm with lots of love. The author explains how him growing up in his environment had showed him that ""family"" didn't necessarily mean blood relative. Everyone in his neighborhood came together in ""great solidarity and friendship."" Whatever family members had went to the authors home, his parents would take them in no matter what because they knew if they were in the same situation they would be welcomed also. So for that they always kept their arms and door wide open to people they considered family. The author also mentioned that he would always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice and how important family and friends are. So in conclusion, the mood was warm and loving because he learned the real meaning of ""family"" and how he learned about how to love."	3	4		4																					
12155	5	"The mood created by the author was one of happiness, love, and caring. Not only does it show in his style, but the author also gives details that really create the vibe. In paragraph @NUM1, the author describes the food as ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking,"" and the music as ""passionate Cuban music...mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This creates a homely affect to the scene, along with the paragraph about the many ""family members"" that came over for meals. The author describes this and explains that this was all possible, despite the nation's racism, because his parents worked hard to get where they were for the faith that their children would have a better life than they had. With all of the details, the author creates a loving, cultural affect can only be found with great family and friends."	3	3		3																					
12160	5	"In this memoir about @PERSON1 the reader learns alot about the @CAPS1 by the mood (or tone) of the memoir. The mood of this memoir is greatful, because he is thinking of all the opportunities he got to have since his parents were so caring and selfless.     In the memor the reader learns that parent makes so many sacrifices for their children that helping around the house and thanking them is the least they can do.      In conclusion the mood in the memoir Home: The @CAPS2 prints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez is, happy, and greatful because of the sacrifices made by his parents. A good citation for this is ""even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."""	2	3		3

First of all @CAPS2 felt proud of his parents because they share ""Cooking duties and the work around the house."" @CAPS1 of all @CAPS2 felt @CAPS3 of knowing cuban background and @CAPS2 was proud because his parents were cuban. @CAPS2 was very admire by his parents because @CAPS2 was proud of being cuban two. These is the mood created by the author in the momoir."	1	2		2																					
12164	5	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, it gives a cheery, happy safe mood. Paragraph @NUM1 explains a traditional cuban home, with the cooking and music and everything. It's like that in my house, just with @CAPS1 things, not Cuban. Also, the narrator explains how everyone in the neighborhood was a close - knit family of Cuban, spanish and Italian people. No one would hurt one other and every one will help in case of a problem, giving a safe feeling. Lastly, All of paragraph @NUM2 and @NUM3 explains how his parents risked everything to be in the @CAPS2. My parents did the same thing and it makes me feel happy that they did. So, its probably the same for the narrator. In conclusion, the memoir has a good and happy mood to it."	3	2		3																					
12166	5	"The mood created @CAPS1 the author in the memoir was grateful and loving. In one of the paragraphs, Narciso said, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."" @CAPS1 saying this, @CAPS2 is saying that @CAPS2 is grateful that his parents would give up their lives as they knew it for him. @CAPS2 said that @CAPS2 learned the real definition of ""family."" @CAPS2 knows that members in a family would give up anything to help another member of the family. @CAPS2 also said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" His family helped create a good home with love."	2	2		2																					
12169	5	"The author's mood was wondering and near the end, it changed you happiness. I thought the mood was wondering at first because he was wondering what ""home"" was all about. Then, it was changed to happiness because now the author knew what ""home"" is all about."	1	1		1																					
12170	5	"Fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez is a firm beiliever in friendship and family values. In a selection from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives, he describes the mood, or the feeling created by an author, in his childhood one of family and people with helping hands. Narciso says that everybody in his neighbor hood were ""immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows helpfulness espically in a time when racism and segregation were big in the States. Secondly, their was a sense of family in all of the people at Narciso's house. There was often people staying in his house because they temporarily needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. The Rodriguez's beilieved these people would do the same thing for them in return. Finally, Narciso can not express how grateful he is to have the importance of friends and family put on him so early in his life. Without his parents stressing the fact that family is not only your blood relatives, he would never have beilived that family and helping hands were so important. A mood of family qualities and helpfulness pre vails in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir. "	4	3		4																					
12171	5	The @CAPS1 is writing in first person narrative. The @CAPS2 sets a tone with and about How he is so proud of his cuban relationship and haritage. He is also very happy and proud about how he has great parents and a great house and very very fund memories of all these things. He also explains and talks about other people and how it was hard to leave cuba and come to america. That is how the @CAPS1 sets the tone for this story.	2	2		2																					
12173	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", what is the mood created by the author?The mood that the authors creates while writing this passage is very cultural like. Because she reason is. That he uses good detail in decribing the home of the character. For example, @CAPS1 Cuban music (which I adore to this day). This shows that there was some beautifull cultural music.Another way is that he is in a cultral mood is when he says. ""My young parents created our traditional cuban home."" This shows that they took what they had in Cuba and brang it to @LOCATION1. Also that they wanted it to be like home in which they miss.In this memoir there @MONTH1 have been other ways to describe the mood of what the author created. But I think the cultral mood is one of the bigger ones. Thats what I showed you in these two paragraphs."	1	2		2																					
12179	5	"The @CAPS1 created by the author of the memoir is warm and inviting. In this quote the authors childhood is revealed and how he feels about it, ""The innocence of childhood, the congregation of the family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm home. Also when the author says this it creats a happy @CAPS1 and shows how greatful he is to his parent's, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. The last qout wraps up his feeling about his life and how he feels ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love./I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""

12185	5	"The mood in this memoir I believe  is appreciation and caring towards others. @NUM1 home as well as neighborhood was a place of unity and caring for one another like a family. In the memoir it says that people were always coming in and out of the house for a place to stay or for a meal to eat and were always welcomed with open arms. ""Family""  to him didn't mean you were related but were loved and cared for by other and with that mindset he had a huge family. His parent left behind their lives in Cuba where they were both scientists and had friends and family there for their son. They knew that the United States had better oppurtunitis for Narciso (in which he becomes a designer). He states several times how grateful he is of his parents for them to move to the @LOCATION3 for him as well as making his house feel like a home."	3	3		3																					
12187	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our Lives the overall mood of the author is greatfulness. Narciso begins the memoir by telling us how much @CAPS3 appreciates his culture and all that his parents do for him In paragraph @NUM1, ""... And unwittenly passed on to me the rich culinary skills and love of cooking... (For which I am eternally greatful)"" @CAPS3 has an optemistic outlook on every aspect of his family and his culture. Most of it had to do with how @CAPS3 grew up and was born into a family who had just finished their hardships of getting int @LOCATION1."	2	2		2																					
12189	5	The mood was a little sad at certian times and greatful at others. It was sade that they have to leave Cuba and start all over agin. It was greatful becase they hade family that loved them and cared for them.	1	1		1																					
12191	5	"The mood of the memoir is appreciation. I think it's this mood because in the final paragraph the author says, ""... I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" @CAPS1 fact is, in paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON1 talks about how he kept thanking his parents for everything he had. He states, ""I've often told them that what they did is a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" I guess he is just very grateful for his parents, his childhood, everything and everyone he has ever met, had or done in his life. If I were in his shoes, I'd be grateful, too. This opened my eyes and now, I, too, am grateful for everything and everyone I have in my life."	2	3		3																					
12192	5	The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is very sensative way. And what I mean by that in paragrap @NUM1 and @NUM2 it sound's like the @CAPS1 is getting real emotional. It say's in paragraph @NUM1 I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and scrifice.	1	1		1																					
12198	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is emotional. The mood is emotional because his family left ther homeland for the freedom of ther children. They gave up everthing including family for the kids. The fact that they didn't know anybody or the town itself was amazing. Jobs were few, money was sarce. Even though hard times, after there over, it's the best times of all. Family can be in a place with no relatives, That is the mood created by the autheor in the memoir"	2	1		2																					
12200	5	"In his memoir Home: Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez creates a warm, familial mood. Narciso deep gratitude for his parents' decision to move to the United States has a large effect on the mood. He describes how brave his mother and father must have been to make the life-changing choice, and admits that ""I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude."" The author understands what a large, positive influence his parents have had on him, and his gratitude for his family contributes to the warm mood of the piece. Narciso's admiration for his family also develops the atmosphere of the memoir. He uses words like selfless and hardworking to describe his family, and tells them of his ""admiration for strength and perseverance."" @CAPS1 his descriptions of the feats his parents have accomplished and the hardships they have had to endure, the author conveys his feeling of true admiration for his family to the reader. However, absolute love is the strongest emotion that the reader feels from the memoir. Narciso uses careful selection of what memories he writes in his memoir, along with the addition of passionate words like warm, gracious, honest, and close-knit to make the love within his family stand out. Although there were certainly fights within his family, he never mentions them, focusing instead on the underlying bond he felt with his relatives and how the warmth of his kitchen ""filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" Narciso is passionate enough about the atmosphere within his family that he makes the gratitude, admiration, and love he feels for his relatives the focus of his memoir."	4	4		4																					
12204	5	"There where many different moods that the author created in the memoir. The three most important moods where grateful, loving, and happy.

They where also lucky that they where going to have a better life. The second most important mood was loving. This family showed alot of love for each other. An example that shows how loving they are is when it @CAPS1 they left their family, friends, and careers so their children could have a better life. The last mood was happyness. When reading this story you can really tell that this family was happy. It talks about how they will never forget the memories and how generous their parents where. In conclusion there where many different moods in this story. The three main moods where grateful, loving, and happy"	3	3		3																					
12205	5	"In the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 gives a loving and caring mood to the readers. I think this because whe he describes certain things, like his parents, he would add a loving and caring feeling. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will never foreget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That sentence indicates how much he Loved his parents for doing that. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" that indicates how apriciative he was. Also this memoir gives a grateful and thankful mood because it makes you think about the people and family members that had loved and sacrificed for you. That is why I think the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 gives off loving and caring mood to the readers."	2	3		3																					
12206	5	"The mood created by the author is welcoming. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the iron bound section of Newark, New Jersey."" This gives the feeling of being welcomed because it makes me feel like we just saw Narciso Rodriguez's house and we are about to walk in. ""In our neighborhood, despite custums elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship."" This makes me feel welcome because it doesn't matter if you are different you are still family. ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This gives me the feeling of being welcomed because it was imagery that makes me imagine and I'm able to picture this house, with brilliant smells and lovely cuban music playing. In conclusion, the mood of being welcomed is portrayed strongly throughout the memoir, especially when he is describing his home"	3	3		3																					
12208	5	"There are many moods in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez.

12221	5	"This memoir creates a peacefull mood. It is telling us of his childhood. Narciso writes, ""In 1961 I was born into this simple house,"". As a child you have nothing but peace. He had many visitors. He writes ""my mother took in refug is welcoming them into the country"". He obviously had a nice enviornment with all those visitors. He is explaining his past. He loves his house and the enviornment it creates. He writes ""I will never forget how my parents turned that simple house into a home,"". It just put your mind at ease. That is how this article creates a peace ful mood"	2	3		3																					
12224	5	"In the memoir, @ORGANIZATION1 the mood created @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS3 is hard and happy.The first place in the story when the @CAPS3 creates a hard mood is when they say that racism is overt. ""Spanish, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 immigrants overt racism"". this show that the mood is hard because we know that at that time racism was occurring so that made it hard for them to fit in with everybody else.The last place in the story were the author creates a happy mood is when the neighborhood came together. ""In our neighborhood, despite custom elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship"". This displays a happy mood because is represents a whole bunch of diffrent people comming together to work together.As you can see @CAPS3 creates two different types of moods hard, and happy."	3	2		3																					
12229	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is they had no problem finding a house. for example the author states ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally greatful)."" This means that they are great cooks and have skills for cooking. ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us."" Even though they first came to the @CAPS1. S they had no problem finding a home. ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays.""

An example of this can be found throughout the story, especially in the ending paragraph when Narciso Rodriguez sums up the memoir and expresses how grateful he was toward his parents and the childhood he had. Also in the third and fourth paragraphs when he talks about his neighbors and how everybody got along with eachother, and how they frequently had meals together, I find the mood to be relaxing in paragraph three and four also, but mainly in paragraph @NUM1 when he talks about his kitchen and the smells, aromas, and music that used to dance through the air. The over all mood of the memoir could be considered gratefullness. I could be considered gratefulness because Narciso Rodriguez always states how grateful he is for his parents and child hood."	3	4		4

Not every family can work well with everyone else. Not every family can have the satisfaction of sharing and giving to others. This is a feeling of gratefulness because of the parents. The authors consistantly praises them on their courageous acts, and even going against the law to help those in need.

To me that sounds like @CAPS2 because he knows he can always come home to his Parents if he ever need help. Another example is in @CAPS3 @NUM1 it says ""I learned there about how to love"". That to me sounds like when he was growing up it was rough and he never actually loved some one in his life until now."	1	3		2

12478	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, a great mood is created by the author. This mood is unity. One reason why the mood is unity is because even while Narciso Rodriguez's parents moved from Cuba to the United States they stayed together. After they had first moved to the @LOCATION3 they had a child and that really shows how much unity came into play. Another reason why the mood of this memoir is unity is because, when the Rodriguez's were first living in the United States, the other immigrants in their neighborhood became family. And paragraph three it says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" A synonym for solidarity is unity, so here the author is even saying how his neighborhood all united into one big happy neighborhood.

In the fourth paragraph explains how extended family members could rely on eachother, because they know that they would do the samething if someone else was in need of help. Those are two examples of how the mood is loving. Another way the mood can be loving, and appriciative, is in paragraph five. Paragraph five shows that @PERSON1' parents would do anything to make their childrens lives better. in this case it was leaving friends, family, and work behind and moving to a totally different country. All in all the mood is given off as loving and appreciative even through the hard times of Narciso's life."	3	4		4

12504	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives a certain mood was created. The type of mood that was created by the author is a warm and @CAPS1 mood. It was because of the different things that were happening in this community, and more importantly the house. This house had become a home to Narciso because of all the different that would happen there. like the Cuban music, the constant in and out of extended family members, and the fact that this all happened because his parents selflessly came to this country to give him a better life, even though they had to leave behind their families, careers, in the country they loved. This is the mood created by the author in this memoir."	2	2		2																					
12511	5	"The mood created by the story could be described as thanfullness or gratitude. After reading about a loving pair of parents that gave everything they had just for their children makes you feel guilty and respectful of your own parents. The author portrayed that they were grateful for their parents and they he or she knew they would never be able to repay them. From what the author says, times at home financially @MONTH1 have been tough, but because they had such a loving family, everything was alright. It makes me happy and proud to think that my family plays a huge part in who I am. The mood that is created by this story is admiration."	2	2		2																					
12518	5	"The mood of the memoir created by the author was that he was very greatful for what his family has done. I know this because throughout the memoir he would always say how much he appreciated how his parents made this house into a Cuban home. I also know that the mood of the memoir by the author is greatful because he said how he liked that his neighborhood had many different cultures such as Spanish and Italian. The author also said ""I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home."" That is what I think the mood of this memoir is."	2	3		3																					
12531	5	"In the memoir, @PERSON1, from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author created a mood for @PERSON1. The mood the author created was something different, but it never seems to go down.As Narciso Rodriguez really gives you the definition of ""family"", in the memoir. One of the examples the author created for the mood is ""Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" In the paragraph before that they talked about moving into a new home, and to the heart was the kitchen, they cooked while listening to cubic music. Narciso said, ""she's internally grateful to know how to cook, and she still enjoys listening to cubic music."" Its a happy mood, showing memory. Another example is, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture."" Narciso's mood is suddenly more strict, but proud of her parents. The last example would be, in all of the last paragraph. ""It was at her home where she learned the real definition of 'family'."" ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Narciso's mood is so happy and pround to say that her home and family really meant a lot to her. The mood the author created for Narciso Rodriguez was always proud, happy, but never sad. She had a lot of memories from one home."	4	4		4																					
12537	5	"In this memoir, the author, Narciso Rodriguez enstills a kind of loving mood and a strong feeling of gratitude. He is thankful for the fact that his parents sacrificed their happiness and family for the well-being of their child's (Narciso's) life, as shown in paragraph @NUM1, where it says: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Also, Narciso gives a feeling of admiration for his parents. He admires their courage for leaving all the wonderful stuff in Cuba, as he says in paragraph @NUM2: ""I've often told them [his parents] of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly.""All in all, Narciso really shows a feeling of love in this memoir."	3	3		3																					
12543	5	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is by in paragraph @NUM1 it say's ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense The ""family"" had Nothing to do with being a blood relative."" and in paragraph @NUM2 it say's ""it was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with Not just scent and music but life and love It was here where I Learned The real definition of ""family."" These are the mood created by The @CAPS1 in the memoir. "	2	2		2																					
12548	5	"The mood in the memoir doesn't change alot. Narciso Rodriguez mood is happy in the end because @CAPS1 says ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" @CAPS1 also says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS2 there I think Narciso is happy. The mood is mostly calm & happy because @CAPS1 telling the courage his parents had. Thats the mood the author gave."	2	2		2																					
12561	5	"I think the mood of the memoir is overall positive. The charactor is always complimenting his parents and is always telling him he admires ""their strength and perseverance."" @CAPS1 of the memoir is the child complimenting the parents and culitur. Narciso strongly adores him family."	1	1		1																					
12565	5	"I think the authors mood is, honored, proud, loving, and appreciated. I think the author mood is part of being honored because (in paragraph @NUM1) he really expressed how he feels about his parents being so loving and makes others feel loved and welcomed. I also think he was proud because, he explains (in paragraph @NUM2) how much he appreciates his family and his parents to have open arms and help thoughs in need, and to have such great parents that he does'nt even have words really to express to commitment and kindness his parents have with everyone. Through out the story the author alway's mentions How loving his partent are and you can see in the passage that he picked that trait up with the words and expression he used in the story to express the fact of his parents being loving to their family and their @CAPS1. Those are what I think are his moods and the reason for them."	2	2		2																					
12570	5	"The mood that the author creates in the memoir is loving and grateful. Narciso tells the reader about how grateful. @CAPS1 is for living in @LOCATION1, and that even though @CAPS1 didn't live in a big, nice house, her family is what makes her love her house. @CAPS1 loves and appreciates what her family did for her. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. @CAPS1 will never forget the house because it is where @CAPS1 learned the real definition of family. ""It is where I learned the real definition of ""family."" And For this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. "	2	2		2																					
12571	5	"In the memoir, the author doesn't just describe the journey to @LOCATION1 and the house he lived in. He gives a in depth and warm description of his life in @LOCATION1 and the relationships he made. He also spends some time talking about the selflessness of his parents and what they do to make the new immigrants feel welcome in this new place.The author sets the mood that makes people wanna read this if they are feeling sad and they just want to get a warm, cozy feeling from it. I think the mood in this gives off a sence of being selfless, but also coming together when all are segregated and form unity. When you turn segregation into unity then good things are bound to happen. The authors says this in his memoir: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood of this story really shows you that the world doesn't have to be a cold, heartless place.If we do as they do, we can all live in unity."	3	2		2																					
12574	5	"The mood created by the author is happy. A sense of security with friends families and neighbors. His parents sacrificed there careers and leave behind friends and family basically starting there life over for the benifit of their children.  Where Narciso lived was a nice two-family blond brick building. There she learnd cuban culture such as cooking and music that filted the house when she was a child. Narciso had tons of ""families."" Not necessarily blood related, their neighbors were mostly immagrants and when all thoes cultures came together there was great solidarity and friendship. She lived in a close community were helping hand was always there if needed. Her parents always kept their arms and their door open. Alegria their land lords daughter came down to their kitchen more often than not. Also her aunts Bertha and Juanita along with her cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary. Often someone would stay with them temporolly Even in hard times her parents would sacrifice anything for her And for that Narciso is greatful. Greatful to her parents for makeing a simple house into a home."	4	4		4																					
12583	5	In This memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our lives The @CAPS3 explains the definition family as not blood relatives but as people who leave a lasting imprint in your life because of the large impact they had on you and the role played by them in your life portraying a figure of some sort in your eyes As the @CAPS3 descriptively went through this the whole time @CAPS5 was talking about family and the definition of it they were not portrayed as people related to you but just basically people who were their for you the one who gave the shoulder to cry on as in the memoir the land lord and his daughter had put food on the table for the @CAPS6 more often than not and How the whole community had been a family because they acted as one reaching out to lend a hand though they had come from very different backgrounds some more different from each other stood unified resulting in something more they were a family	3	2		3

Also when she says that ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" it shows how prouud she is."	2	2		2																					
12589	5	"The mood that author has created in this memoir was a happy feeling because this is proud of his culture. He loves his parents and loves that house that they turned into a home. The author exsplains how his life begain in new jersey and how proud of his parents he was and that he looks up to them and plans on carryinging out the culture and triditions that his family had so that's what makes me think that the mood of that the author sets was happiness and fullness of this familys life, and as I read this passage I was glad and happy for him that he admires his family that much and how happy his life was."	2	3		3																					
12597	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is love. Narciso and his family had so much love that they were able to overcome struggles and help others to overcome by allowing them to stay in their home, and live with them. They allowed people who weren't even apart of their family to become part of their family, they loved and cared for other, possiably even more than them selves and gave up everything they had in cuba to come to america for a better future for their children. The amount of love in this house is what turned it form an ordiary house and into a loving, caring, compassionate, and selfless home, not only for Narciso but for everyone in the community, and family"" that was created. That is what the mood of this memoir was, and in whom created it."	2	3		3																					
12600	5	"The mood given by the author in this memoir is happiness. In the memoir Narciso talks about how greatful he is that his parents left the one place they love, Cuba, just so they can give there children a better life in the @ORGANIZATION1. Narciso explains how much he loves his parent for the love and sacrifice they have put forward for example ""In Cuba, Narciso, SR., had worked in the laboratory and @LOCATION1 had studied chemical engineering. In the united states, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking what ever work they could find."" Narciso loves his parents for this sacrafice they did and the risk they took just so he can have a better life and this is why he wrote this memoir."	2	2		2																					
12602	5	"The mood the author created in the memoir was about family. He describes how it was when he was growing up in New Jersey. He talk's about ""Sergio and Edelmira"" who were his grandparents ""his real grandparents he did not see until 1970. Even though alot of the people around him were not his real family he consider them to be because they cared and love him. That's what I think the mood in the memoir is."	1	1		1																					
12608	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very happy and appreciative of what he once had. I can tell because every time the author speaks he is always happy, and I noticed not one negative thing was said during the story. An example of appreciating his life is where he states in paragraph @NUM1, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 could tell he was happy because he'll never forget how nice and giving his parents were. Another example of the mood being happy is where it says in paragraph @NUM2, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows how happy he was because of how much his parents loved him. My third example in the story is when the author states in paragraph @NUM3, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows that the writer appreciates how much his parents cared for others, and how much others cared for them. My fourth and final example is in paragraph @NUM4 it states, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant having to leave behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This statement shows how happy and appreciative the author is, because of how the author's parents left everything to give their kids a great life. And those were for specific examples of how the mood created by the author was very happy and appreciative in the memoir."	3	4		4																					
12610	5	"The mood created by the author is a happy and grateful one. The memoir expresses a positive mood and their are no signs, at all, of negativity throughout the memoir. The author created a mood that tells the reader that he does not regret anything from his childhood and he's grateful for his wonderful and caring parents. The author created a mood that also tells the reader that he is proud of his Cuban heritage and everything and everyone that he has grown up around. Narciso has also made a mood of strong feelings toward his beloved parents, friends, and family. The mood of this memoir is positive and can be described in great meaning."	2	1		2																					
12614	5	"Inthe memoir the author the mood the author sets is a thankful soft one The author is thanking his parents in a good way, in a nice, soft, and appreciative way. ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house with a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always fills the air with not just scent and music but life and love (pg. @NUM1). All you need in life is a little imagination and a lot a help and love.

12621	5	"in This @CAPS1, narciso Rodriguez, The @CAPS2 in the @CAPS1 would be a @CAPS5 bit sad, sad because @CAPS3 is taking about her life and how @CAPS3 grows up in a one @CAPS5 Simple house in 1961. her mother didns want her to live anywhere else. @CAPS3 was a only child. and this @CAPS1 tells you mostly about her life. That is the @CAPS2 in the @CAPS1 @PERSON2."	1	0		1																					
12622	5	I think the mood given by the author in the memoir is a happy mood. I think this because throughout the entire memoir the author didn't talk about one unhappy thing. In paragraph @NUM1 the author talks about how his parents taught him how to cook and how they gave him a love for passionate Cuban music. In paragraph @NUM2 the author talks about the unity and friendship throughout his neighborhood despite the racial differences. The author talks about all his friends and family who graced his table in paragraph @NUM3. The most important thing I think he talked about was how he learned to love in paragraph @NUM4.      As you can see there are no sad memories in this memoir and I think that is what gives it such a happy mood.	3	3		3																					
12623	5	"The mood created in the memoir was very greatful because of @PERSON1's family that nearly gave everything up to have a wonderful life in New Jersey. He was grateful for the talents his parents passed on such as cooking and loved the heritage they had like their interest in Cuban Music. @PERSON1 must've been very grateful to be surrounded by so many loving people like his ""@CAPS1 lord and his daughter, @PERSON2 (my baby sitter and first friend)...(who) graced our Kitchen table for meals more often than not"""	2	2		2																					
12624	5	"Based on the excerpt of the ""@PERSON1"" by the blueprints of our Lives, That mood created by the author is happness and @CAPS1.When the author restate when the girl says I will allways be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. That shows How much @CAPS2 cares about her mother and father and How respectful @CAPS2 is towards them. Anothe example that her mother and father is @CAPS3 and cares a lot is when her mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. That line proves how much the mom and dad care about there daughter."	2	1		2																					
12625	5	The mood created by the author was very interesting. At some points the author was very serious. He would tell about the hard times his family had and what they went through. Then he would be joy ful. He would explain what his house would be like. He would tell how joy ful his house was and how he loves his parents so much. He would explain what loving parents he had. He showed how his family wasn't blood related at all. His family was different cultures all combined to make one happy family.	1	2		1																					
12627	5	"The mood in the memoir of the life of Narciso Rodriguez is mostly how the bonds between him and his parents, and everyone around them got them through tough times. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 he states that in their neighborhood ""cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"" And how ""immigrants extended helping hands to people, who were not only their own kind, but who needed a helping hand."" The author says that in his community many different cultures came together and help each other through racism, and other tough times. He says that ""family"" isn't just those you are related to blood, but those who are close to your heart."	2	2		2																					
12630	5	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1 from Home: The blueprints of our lives."" I belive the author Narciso Rodriguez, demostraigted the mood of being laidback very acticulatly.This memoir dose not soud very formal due to the fact Narciso does little things like adding parenthenthese with aditoal statments for exsample in paragraph @NUM1. And taking about his friends and family so openly.Thats why I @PERSON1's memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The blue prints of our lives."" @CAPS1 the mood of being laid back."	0	1		1																					
12632	5	"In this memoir, the mood created by the author was heartwarming and apperciative. There were so many parts to this story that made me feel so warm and made me want to say ""aw"". For example, in paragraph @NUM1 where it states, ""was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people, not nessecarly of their own kind, were clearly in need"". This line showed me how much love there must've been. Also, that everyone cared about everyone else. When the author is showing how her parents left their country to come to @LOCATION1, you can tell how grateful the author is this is shown extremely clear in paragraph @NUM2 where it states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.I think this story made me realize that you need to apperciate what others do for you. This author was so greatful for her parents, and that is shown very clearly in this memoir."	3	3		3																					
12636	5	"When reading this memoir it makes you feel something. The feeling you feel is a sort of sorrow. When you feel this it makes you think why did they have to live that way. It also shows that you care for the people Who deal with that lifestyle, @CAPS1 for goodness sake be nice to people dont be nasty because what you do could affect you too."	1	0		1																					
12641	5	"The mood created by the memoir is a mix between a happy mood and an unhappy mood. Everything is happy when they talk about his parents welcoming the other imagrents into thier home. And how thier landlords daughter was his first friend. And then how it talks about how thier neigerhood is filled with @CAPS1, Spanish, and Italian imigrents and how they are in that neghborhood because of racism."	1	2		2																					
12645	5	"The mood created by the author is quite comforting and homey. As the author describes his life growing up at home as a child, he seemed to have a pleasant life. when he (the author) ex plained how greatful he was to have learned all the things he had from his family, it portreyed a simple but very enjoyable mood. When the author spoke of his family and friends that came to dine in the apartment that was made into a home, Narciso created a very relaxed mood. Everyone who came to the Rodriguez's home was welcomed and treated as if they were close family. The overall mood of this memoir is friendly and welcoming just as the Rodriguez's home was."	3	2		3																					
12649	5	"Home is where the heart is, many of said this and many more have meant it. In the non-fictional memoir by @PERSON1 talks about the importance of family. Narciso pats many moods into the story and describes them with such grace. ""Friends and celebrations both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (paragraf @NUM1) This gives a sence that for him home was the safest and happiest place for him to be. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open the the many people we considered family."" (paragraf @NUM2) This gives off the mood that his home was a very careing place and that anyone that they loved was cared for. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'."" (paragraf @NUM3). This sets the mood that he was never really alone that he had people with him at all times that cared and loved for him like he loved for them. ""My parents turned this simple house into a home."" (paragraf @NUM3)"	3	3		3																					
12662	5	"In this article the author kind of gave a both happy and proud mood. He loved where he came from. Where he was raised, and mainly the life his parents provided for him. He adores his parents and couldn't be more gratefull. They turned a house into a home. They didn't thousands to be happy all they needed was each other...and they did. He is what he is and that's extremly proud of his Cuban life and family."	2	2		2																					
12663	5	The mood created by the author is that @PERSON1 is greatful for his education and growing up in @LOCATION1. Also his parents and they're cooking skills. The mood is love and greatfulness.	1	1		1																					
12665	5	"@PERSON1 uses a very happy tone and mood when talking about his home." ...Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and For which I am eternally grateful). Narciso is very happy he learned such great cooking in his childhood. "Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home" (@NUM1). Being so happy made this such a warm home in @CAPS1. "I will never Forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home" (@NUM2). Narciso summed up his entire article in one sentence and creating what most people feel at home. At my home I feel everything Narciso does because its not were you live its how you live."	2	3		3																					
12671	5	"The mood created by the author is the mood of appreciation for his house and parents. First, he author talks about how her parents give up what ever they had for them. It says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially..."" This means that their parents gave up their family and friends and jobs in their beloved country, Cuba, just for him and his sister so he appreciate them a lot for doing all of these for them. Secondly his parents showed him the two lessons abot life. The story states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... I've often told them the admiration for their strength and perseverance... and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life. This shows that his parents taught his something important without telling him by showing him. Third, he learned the real definition of family. It says ""It was where I learned the real definition of ""family."" It shows he learned the most important lesson it this house. These is the mood and how it is shown."	4	3		4																					
12675	5	"The mood in this memoir is a very relaxed and happy mood. Narciso is always happy in the house, there was always the smell of food, and his parents cooking. There was always a strong sense of family and the house too. In pharagraph @NUM1, Narciso said that ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" What he is saying is that you don't have to be related to be family. Anyone close enough can be considered family. He also felt that you should always help people in need. That is what his parents, they always help people when they need it. and were always willing to share everything they have. That is the mood instilled in this memoir about family and love."	3	3		3																					
12677	5	the mood givin by the @CAPS1 (In My prospective) is happy becaus even if you had to move to @LOCATION1 away from his loved ones he still managed to be happy with his family in @LOCATION1	1	1		1																					
12682	5	"In the storie ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I think the author was very greatful & happy at the moment. I think he was happy, because he was lathing about how Narciso was always in a good mood and how she always loved how to cook in the kitchen with everyone. Also how she still loved her ritual song she sings with her family."	1	2		2																					
12683	5	"The mood that was creat by this author was love. It was love by how he discribed his house. ""The passionate cuban music fill the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Cooking and music you usally associate with love and love is happiness The author also talks about his ""close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extanded a hand to people who, not necessarily their own kind were clearly in need."" This also shows the mood in this memore is love, love of cooking of music and of family. Another place were it showed love in the memore was in this quote. ""My Parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows love because even though these people aren't blood related they still look out for each other and knew they had someone to lean on. The apparent mood in this story was love and the family had much of it."	4	3		4																					
12689	5	"In the memoir ""@CAPS1 Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by @CAPS2 is shocking. First, on page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2 Rodriguez wrote, ""I would not know my 'real' grandparents... leave Cuba."" Here, Rodriguez is talking about how she never meat @CAPS2 real grandparents until they left Cuba in 1970. This is important  because early in the memoir she said @CAPS2 surrogate grandparents (Sergio, Edelmira) came to eat dinner. In conclusion,  in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by @CAPS2 is shocking, @CAPS2 real grandparents come to @ORGANIZATION1 in 1970. She wanted to write this because she wanted to teach the reader to know the real deftion of family."	1	0		1																					
12691	5	"The mood created by the authour iN the memoir is love aNd happyNess and how family are frieNds. IN the memoir he expaNeds how his mom and dad gave up everything for there child aNd his life. How they had to chaNge everything they did in Cuba. Like the jobs, IN Cuba His dad had worked iN a laboratory aNd his mom had studied chemical eNgiNeering aNd they might have to give it up. thats the mood created by the authour iN the memoir."	1	1		1																					
12694	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was loving and caringness. Repeatedly throughout the memoir, the speaker Narciso Rodriguez which show what his family did after migrating from their native country, Cuba to their love. As said his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family, knowing that they would do the same for them. They cared for their children's future, by leaving their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. All though ""they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" they had to do what they thought was best for their children. Their simple house was the best place for them to be together as a family. ""The warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"". This memoir made me connect this family to mines how similar it is. Without love it isn't a family, thats why at the end of the word ""family"" the i, l, y stand for ""i love you."""	3	3		3																					
12700	5	"The author created a tone in the memoir that was truthful and grateful and pride inducing.  ""pasionate Cuban music... Filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations... that formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@NUM1). The former quote was found in paragraph @NUM1 described the pride and gratefulness of the home in which the author lived. The memoir created a Family love which every person longs for in life. "" They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" (@NUM3). Anyone who can sacrifice like that for the better life of their family is a good person. That is the family love I am describing being selfless and loving to other members of your family. Another mood created in the memoir was pride in the family's sacrifice. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a more courageous thing than I could have ever done"" (@NUM4). That was a quote from paragraph @NUM4. It shows that you have to be thankful for the sacrifices people make for you. All of which make the qualities of a good family life."	4	3		4																					
12702	5	"The mood created by this memoir is a relaxed caring kind of mood. Several parts of this work emphasize this mood. The author often writes about how he loves his parents for their selflesness. This emphasizes the mood, and he repeats it many times and the repetition helps build mood as well. A final thing that helps the mood is how he describes how everyone in his nieghborhood was kind to each other. In conclusion, there are many things in this work that emphasize a relaxed, caring mood."	2	2		2																					
12713	5	"The mood of the author and the memoir is greatful. The author is very greatful for his parents. He is thankful for his parents because they gave up their life for him. They moved from their country so that he could grow up in @LOCATION1. His parents quit their jobs and came over all for him. He is also greatful for his extended family and friends. They are the ones who he eats with, plays with and etc. He takes care of them and they take care of him. They are his surrogate grandparents, aunts, uncles cousins and friends. He is also thank full for his culture. All his food along with traditions come from cuba. The author is greatful."	2	2		2																					
12724	5	"In my opinion the mood is created by the auther in the memoir by the setting and describing her child hood, where she was born and why her parents came here. The reason I think this is because the mood can create this setting, because the mood is the feeling in the story, such as sad, happy, lonely, silent and that is what creates the setting which is where, when, and time of the story. Some examples from the excerpt are, ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family building, in the Ironbound Section of Newark, New Jersey."" Also, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" The author is very thankful for her cuban heritage and her home is about relationship then just space. In this memoir the mood created the setting."	3	2		3																					
12730	5	"The mood the @CAPS1 creates is happy. He had no negative comment about his parents or the way he grew up. His parents sacrificed everything for him so he can have a better life. Also the feel of his home reflected on the mood. It was a warm and safe environment in paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" @CAPS2 can really tell that he loved his home and family and the reflected upon the mood."	2	2		2																					
12735	5	"I feel that the mood (s) created by the author in the memoir is happy, proud, and grateful. I think that the author makes the memoir feel happy because he is saying that his parents were kind and they worked hard and that made him happy I think.Another mood I think is he was proud. He said (in paragraph @NUM1) that growing up in his environment istilled a great sence of family. His family welcomed other refugees from cuba to celebrate their arrival to this country. Thanks to what he grew up in he learned the real definition of family.The last mood I feel the author created was he was grateful. He said in paragraph @NUM2 that ""I will always be grateful for my parents love and sacrifice. He is gratful to his parents and how they ""turned a simple house into a home"" (paragraph @NUM3). That's what I feel the mood (s) are in the memoir are."	4	2		3																					
12742	5	"In the memoir Narciso rodriguez by Home, the mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is that growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life. but, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.  I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	3	2		3																					
12744	5	Well first the authur feels happy and exsited but he also feels sad cause he is moving to @LOCATION1.

When he showed his love for his home and culture his parents had shown him made the @CAPS1 feel uplifting. that is how Narciso Rodriguez created @CAPS1 in the memoir, by talking about happy uplifting topics."	2	2		2																					
12757	5	"The mood created is happiness & pride. Like in paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""community of honest, hardworking immigrants."" Being honest and hardworking are two qualities to have.

The fact that the author puts so much happiness, love and life into his memoir is what makes it so interesting to read and what makes the mood so fantastic."	3	2		3																					
12765	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a family mood. Rodriguez talks about how family always visits. The memoir states ""countless extended family members came and went..."" (paragraph @NUM1). He also explains that family isn't always the people related to you.

Narciso Rodriguez really creates a mood filled with love, caring, and family."	3	3		3																					
12766	5	"In the @CAPS1 from ""Home: The Blueprints of our lives,"" @PERSON2 creates a very distinct mood. I think the mood of the @CAPS1 is Warm, caring, comforting, and very loving. The author's home is very family oriented, but not to just blood family. His neighborhood was all family when ""Racism was the norm and segrigation prevailed."" When Narciso Rodriguez discribes this the @CAPS1 sounds comforting and loving. He @CAPS2 ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This brings a happy, light feel to the article and coforting as well.When Rodriguez @CAPS2 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" the mood changes a bit. Now it's admiring, grateful, and compationate. As Narciso Rodriguez discribes his parents Struggle so he could grow up @CAPS4 nicer than they did you can feel hes very grateful and loving.

12805	5	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he creates a happy and excited mood. This is because he is sharing family memories and those of his home. He is happy about them because of all of the good times he had in it. One event he was fond of at his house was his babysitter and first friend Alegria. Narciso shares times hes spent with Alegria and in doing so shows a mood of happiness. When the author talks about the kitchen and the Cuban music it brings an excited mood to my head. I imagine some exotic food cooking with a sweet warm smell and parents talking over the passionate Cuban Music. Narciso Rodriguez's life seems to be one that is very interesting and exciting. I wonder what he's doing now."	3	2		3

In paragraph @NUM2, he states, ""at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed..."" @CAPS1, Narciso's parents had to get through problems with people, and they also had to fight through the mental challenges, due to racism. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says that his parents were always ""braving the harsh winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships.""

A reason why I think this is by talking about how he and his neighbors (of different descent) All got along very well in solidarity with one another which creates a sense of love. Also when he talks about happy times like when he and his family are cooking in the kitchen they are having a good time, laughing, and listening to Cuban Music. Lastly when he and his family take in family or even just really close friends who they consider family conveys a true sense of happiness, peace, and love."	2	2		2

This memoir, to me, was like taking a list of things and putting them into a full paper. The author did not create any kind of mood that interested me to keep reading of this topic. This memoir did however express a lot of feelings though. It expressed how grateful this kid was for his parents and his Cuban descent. Although this memoir had a calm (and slightly boring) mood, the author's ability to reveal information was very deep and insightful."	1	2		2

So he is proud of them. he is also greatful to have parents like this because they do so much for him they cook, clean, and keep a roof over his head and keep him protected. The other mood that is created for me is inspiration this mood is created because of what he says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perservirence. this means that he is proud of his parents and he is thankful for what they do for him, he says tha he is thankful for all they have sacrificed.

12882	5	"In this memoir the author creates a mood which- for me, sucked me into this memoir. I think Narciso Rodriguez created a ""home sweet home"" mood. I say this because when he says, ""within it walls, my young parents created our tradition cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" it reminds me of my family and how my family loves cooking puerto @CAPS1 food. The smell is like, ""your home"". In my home everyone's execpted and even if you're not realated.

This excerpt conveys a feeling of nostalgia and warmth as the author praises his childhood home. In paragraph three the author says: ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This sentence also makes the reader feel nostalgic and warm because the author really gives the reader a sense of his childhood community's unity and love.

In this sentence the author really conveys his @CAPS1 of thanks of his parents to the reader as he praises them.

12918	5	"The mood created in the memoir is very loving and caring and it shows appreciation to the authors parents. The author (@ORGANIZATION1) explains how it was for him as a kid and his ""family"" doesn't always mean a blood relative. He describes the household as being very humble and always had open arms and welcomed others. He also says that it wasn't about the size of the home or how expensive it was, it was about the people inside it and how close they were and the memories they shared.

12928	5	"In the memoir the mood created by the author I think was more of a serious, informative, and uplifting mood. The reason for why I think this is that the way his lifestyle is described as a happy and enjoyable life of also being able to talk about some serious topics like his culture and the diversity of the cultures of the poeple that live on the street. Also by how he feels so confortable with all the people that are in his apartment building and all the people that come to his house for dinner to call them family."	2	2		2

12966	5	"I beleive the mood that sets off in the beggining of the story is how in her house cuban music and great aroma's From @CAPS1's @CAPS2 through the air, I also think that it gives picture of laughter and happiness, And I think that throughout the story @CAPS3 tells that @CAPS3 relizes through spending time with community that his parents are teaching him, Just because someone isn't blood related dosent mean they can't be lik family as said in the package, There teaching him that It Is also people that love you and care about you.

Narciso didnt know his real grandparents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave cuba. This was how the author created the mood."	0	1		1																					
12969	5	The mood is grate full because in cuba which is a central goverment they had to sneek to get in Cuba. Well @CAPS2 felt Great full of What his parents did which was give him a better life.

12981	5	"The mood of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is very loving, grateful, and warm. Firstly, the way that Narciso describes his family and friends and home life is very endearing and clearly expresses the love that he had for the people around him and the building he lived in. The memoir states, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This definitely shows how much he loved his family, home, and friends, and how they taught him how to care for and love others. It brings a great feeling of lovingness this to the reader. Another large contributor to the mood of the story is the gratefullness Narciso feels to have grown up in such a wonderful home. The memoir states, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2).

The memoir states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). Narciso has become a better person because of the warmth and involvement in his home and, like the warmth formed the backdrop of his life it also forms the backdrop for the mood of the memoir."	4	4		4																					
12995	5	"the mood of the @CAPS1 in the article is like kind of happiness and @CAPS2, relax, and grateful. Because their grandparents are coming from Cuba.

Because you have to start your whole life over so you can get a job and provide for your family. This is what I think the mood of the article is about in the memoir."	1	2		2																					
12996	5	"In this memoir, the mood is very light hearted and kind. It gives you a feeling of peace and community.Several times the author tries to show appreciation. Not for any one thing in particular, just gratitude. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, he puts phrases in parentheses for no reason other than to show gratitude for his life as a child. As a result of this, while reading you get a feeling of peace and kindness.Because of his repeated display of gratitude, the mood is light hearted and unserious."	2	1		2																					
12997	5	"The author creates a unique mood in the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. The mood is loving/caring/kind from what the authors saying about his memories.

In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author creates a unique mood."	2	2		2																					
13001	5	I think in some parts @CAPS1 was happy. And then is other parts @CAPS1 was sad because @CAPS1 is talking about her first house in america. @CAPS1 is happy because @CAPS1 can look back on the memories and be happy.	1	1		1																					
13007	5	"The mood set by the author is very solemn. He started by telling the scenery he lived in during a time of segregation. That was hard because he was Cuban. He didn't have a lot of money, and lived in an apartment. His life was like a somewhat below avereage life today.Towards the middle the memoir was still serious but happier in a sense. It was happier because we Know that he could have more life opportunities in @LOCATION1. He grew up and actually met people and made friends. Also he had a caring family that did what they could to make his life easier for him. He made the memoir and nice and passionate.The moods started off a bit shaky and very serious.

""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refuges to celebrate their arrival to this country, and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" @CAPS1 is expressed by the family gathering a the dinner table more times that not. The greatest mood in the memoir is how thankfull he is to his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."""	3	3		3																					
13013	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author explains the true meaning of family and home. The mood is extremely deep and pearsonal as he describes the love and selflessness his family expressed. He explains that his mother and father emigrated from Cuba and moved to @LOCATION1 so that Narciso, their son, would have a better, successful life. Reading this memoir, I can picture Narciso getting very emotional expressing how grateful he is for his parents and family. He explains, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home"" (@NUM1). This sentence and last few paragraphs change the mood a great deal. It went from happy, appreciation, and an explanation of his life to deep, incredibly personal, and to his complete thoughts. Narciso had a great love and admiration for his family and friends like most people should be able to experience like Narciso writes about in his memoir."	2	3		3																					
13015	5	"The mood created by the author was warm, welcoming, and gratefulness. When the author described his home, it gave a feeling of warmth and it was very welcoming.

13019	5	"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a heart-warming, and comforting mood for the readers. First, we see this comforting mood being established through the setting. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home,"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This creatively loving setting gives the reader a sense of comfort when reading the piece. Next, we see this sense of heart-warming coming from Rodriguez's word choice. ""... there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). This rich, vivid word choice sets a caring mood through out the piece. Lastly, the family's background started out somewhat bitter, and depressing when Rodriguez explains their financial instability in @CAPS1 @NUM3, but then later on, we see the family moving to @LOCATION1, and finding comfort in their new home. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us,"" (@CAPS1 @NUM4). This sense of family contributes to the heart- warming mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir."	4	4		4																					
13024	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is set to reflect family values and memories. For example in paragraph @NUM1 she explains that her family is From Cuba and they raised her in a replica of a traditional Cuban home.

13027	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was ment to be a happy and thankful mood. The mood was created happy because the child Narciso was very hapy that his parents moved to @LOCATION1. He was also happy because his house was not just a house it was a home. The kin Narciso was thankful because his parents let other people into the home untill they have somewhere elese they can call home. He is also thankful that he got his parents marvilous culinary skills so he can cook very well. He is also thankful for his parents love and sacrifice. The mood that we are suppose to get is a happy yet calm mood well we read this because Their is nothing to exciting but their is some parts where you get happy for what they did and you feel calm because as I said their is nothing really jumping out at you.  it is just a life story.	3	3		3																					
13034	5	"The author creates a grateful mood. The author writes about how his parents had good jobs in Cuba but left everything to give their children better lives. He also writes about how he grew up, which is parents teaching him about music, cooking, and family. His parents never got the jobs they deserved because of the barriers to work for their children.

13048	5	"The mood that the author was trying to create was a sense of hope, family and happiness. Hope was @CAPS1 because his family helped others by letting them temporarily stay with them until they got back on there feet which provided hope for the extended family. Family was @CAPS1 be cause in the last paragraph he is explaining how in this tiny apartment you learned the definition of ""family"" through welcoming refugees and celebrating his first birthdays and having a loving, careing enviroment. Finally I think happiness was @CAPS1 because he was explaining how grateful he was for his parents coming to america to give him a better life and also in paragraph two he was explaining how his home environment was filled with cooking and music which can be factors of happiness. These are some moods that the author was trying to show."	2	2		2

In paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1 states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 has the opportunity to be born in @LOCATION1 and having a better life. Narciso also learned that @CAPS1 could love a non blood relative because they could be his family too.

13071	5	"In the memoir @PERSON1 from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives there is a thankful and gracious mood.

13078	5	"In the memoir, the author creates a loving mood. I think he creates a loving mood as opposed to something else because of the way he describes and explains things. For example, when he is describing his parents cooking. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air,"". The phrases in parenthesis portrait to me a loving mood. Another part of the memoir that really portraits to me a loving mood is the way the author describes this community and his parents sacrifice is shown by these next to quotes ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"", ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially,"". The detail and emotions he uses in those quotes makes the mood a loving mood for  all the author gives a great and loving mood in this memoir."	3	3		3

13106	5	"All these things that I listed all had something to do with creating the @CAPS1 in this  memoir. But the biggest feeling of all is love his parents went all the way from Cuba just to give @CAPS2 a better life, Even if it meant leaving their jobs, family, friends all behind just to give their son a better life. Also after they arrived they lived in a one room apartment for a year then moved to a new house and made it ""our traditional Cuban home"" so it would teach their son about the place where they came from and to make it feel natural for Narciso When he was born. Even after that they were still kind and had open arm for other immagrants. So I absolutly think that the @CAPS1 in this memoir is about an overwhelming feeling of love."	3	2		3

It is his most favorite place in the whole world and that is why he talks about his home in great detail.

The heart of the house was the kitchen and that was where his parents taught him to cook and showed him the passionate Cuban music In the house, ""...the innocence of childhood the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both formed the backdrop to life in our warm home (@NUM1). Then, @PERSON1 realized that "" 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" (@NUM2), which showed that a neighborhood made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants could get along. Many people had lived at the Rodriguez house, even if they weren't blood related. Some people were the landlord and his daughter, who lived upstairs, while the grandparents lived in the basement. Anyone in the neighborhood was welcome to stay and they would usually stay in the house because they had an economic/money problem, @CAPS1 the Rodriguez family let people stay until they could get back on their feet @CAPS1, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us"" (@NUM3).

And again in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" And @CAPS1 in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. @CAPS1 example is in paragraph @NUM5, when he says, ""they (his parents) came selflessly, as many immagrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.In the memoir the mood that is created is heartwarming.

Also near the end of paragraph @NUM1 it says ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" @CAPS1 are two reasons of why I believe the mood of the memoir the author created is a loving mood. Also in paragraph @NUM3 it says ""countless extended family members came and went- and their was often someone staying with us temporarily untill they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.""

Narcisco is obviously grateful towards his parents for teaching him how to love and that family or friends come first. Narcisco is talking a lot in this memoir about his great family memories of all his friends and family coming over for dinner and his mother cooking in the kitchen traditional Cuban food while listening to traditional Cuban music. He learned that friends and family members are there to love and spend time with.	2	1		2

He also shows how happy he is and how grateful he is of his Parents.He paints a picture with words in the @NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3 @CAPS1 he says My parents where originally from Cuba, And the came here and I was born in a simple house in Jersey. In my house there was beatiful Cuban music and cooking going on we always had family over and neiborgs he paints an nice soothing picture.In the story he also talks about the unity of his neicboorhood made up of mostly spanish immagrints. He talks about that in @CAPS1 @NUM3, @NUM8. This shows you how happy he was.In many places in the story he also says how grate ful he is to his parents and how much courage the had to do the trip.As you can see the mood in this tory is grate ful and happy."	3	3		3																					
13560	5	"The mood of the memoir is pleasent. @PERSON1 talks about her nice childhood. She talks about selfless her parents are to her. Also the mood is set when @PERSON1's is parents help other people get back on their feet. Also talking about how people would eat dinner with @PERSON1's family. She also tells about how she had family that weren't exactly blood relatives but, they were people who cared for each other like a family. Also the way Narciso told was with a very pleasant tone."	2	1		2																					
13565	5	"According to the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author created a mood throughout the memoir. The mood was happiness because Narciso was happy with his life.One example of Narciso's happiness is with his home. When @CAPS1's telling about the apartment @CAPS1 grow up in the mood is happy. Although it wasn't much his parents made him comfortable in it. They made it seem like Cuba as much as they could. Narciso loved his apartment even if it wasn't Cuba. In paragraph two ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" @CAPS1 was happy with the apartment because his parents made it feel like a Cuban home to him.Another example of Narciso's happiness is with his family. Narciso tells how his friends seem like family. In paragraph four ""Our landlord and his daughter... do the same for us."" Even though the people aren't blood related to him @CAPS1's still happy with them. Finally, based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives the author created a happy mood. This mood was created because Narciso is happy with the life @CAPS1 lives."	3	2		3																					
13566	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez From Home: The blueprints of our lives the author sets a sad mood in this memoir. An example of the sad mood set the author describes his neighborhood. The author describes his neighbor hood by saying ""our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, cuban and Italian immigrants."" (@NUM1) This show they live in a run down neighborhood because most immigrants are poor when they arrived at the @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 example is when he describes his family. The author say's ""There was often someone staying with us temporarly until they were able to get back on their feet"". (@NUM2) This shows the poverty that they lived around because they had to put shelter around those who couldn't aford it. The last way the author describes the sacrifice of his parents, The author say's ""The Faith that this would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times"". (@NUM3) This is a sad mood because it shows how their @CAPS2 back fired and they didn't have a very happy time. That is why I think the tone of this memoir is a sad one."	2	3		3																					
13567	5	"The mood of this memoir was very happy, and peaceful. @CAPS1 seems like hes a very happy peorson. ""and for which I am eternally greatful."" @CAPS1 and his parents let anyone that was ""family"" in."	1	1		1																					
13593	5	"In the memoir by @PERSON1, he seems to be very happy. He has a big family and @CAPS1 of friends and many good memories. He comes from a very caring and sharing home. The whole mood of the story is very uplifting."	1	1		1																					
13601	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a nice ""homie"" feeling. The author tries to let you know a home is more than physical walls it is a place for relationships are made. ""The congregation of family and friends."" The is is signifagant because all of the good times an celebrations occurred with the people he loved in his home. The author tries to show the love and affection throughout his home. ""always filled the air with not just sent in music but life and love."" The author shows the love that goes on throughout his home."	3	2		3																					
13603	5	"It creates a mood of happiness ""but Cuban music filled the air as it mixed with the aromas of the kitchen."" this shows what his home was like"	1	1		1																					
13609	5	"There are many different ways on how the mood was created by the author in the memoir. First, he had described his house when he had first moved in. He said that it was a simple house, situated in a two-family and it was a blonde-brick building. Second, he told us how he should be happy of what he has and to be greatful. He was saying that the word solidarity was a big word and meant something. Last, he was describing the hope that he had about his parents and home that he had. He was saying that ""which i am eternally grateful)"" also, ""which i adore to this day"". These are many different ways on how the mood was created by the author in the memoir. "	2	2		2																					
13611	5	"The mood that the author in the memoir created was good by his love, his blood relative, and also by courage.To start with her love is like part of her life. He love his parents. For example In the storie say's ""I will always be grate ful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 this mean she loves he parent for every little single thing they did. Also he learn how to love people.As will as her blood relative meaning that he @CAPS2 got to do with nothing of this. She is from cuba, and came to the united state on 1956. Also born to this a simple house. His that build a traditional home.This is how the author describe the mood, by his love, his blood relative, and also by courage."	2	2		2																					
13612	5	"In the memoir many moods were expressed. I think the mood that was expressed the most was happiness. Narciso described to us that no matter what happened her family and close friends would always feel a sense of belonging with each other. This gave everyone mentioned in the story great reason to be happy and feel good about themselves and each other. In conclusion, the strongest mood in the story was happiness."	2	1		2																					
13616	5	"The mood is @CAPS1 in many ways. First, the mood in this @CAPS2 is @CAPS1 as if he was happy to immigrant to the @LOCATION1 Also its @CAPS1 as sad, ""... Even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"", another mood would be brave. For me these immigraters are brave because I would never want to leave behind my friends and especially my family. Another mood is greatful. ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In conclution, these are many ways the mood is @CAPS1 in this @CAPS2."	2	2		2																					
13622	5	"The mood created by the author is loving and happy for many reasons. It is loving because Narciso really loves his family and is grateful for his parents for giving up there lives, to give him a better one, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" It is happy because the overall memoir is about family and friends and good his child hood was. ""Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Those are the biggest moods that this memoir potrays."	2	2		2																					
13627	5	"The mood of this memoir is nonfiction. The mood is that because Narciso Rodriguez is telling about his past in his and it is about the life he once lived in New Jersey, in a Cuban, Italian, and a Spanish neighborhood. The house was transformed into a home by his parents, his surrogate grandparents, and himself. The home he lived in was a blonde-bricked apartment, filled with Cuban Aromas and Cuban musics. The mood became joyful because of the Family's love of Cuban Music, and Cuban cooking, (which is really good). The mood also is represented with the Family, a loving and caring family in a nice apartment building. The mood is non-fiction, joyful, loving, and caring, I know this because the ""home"" is so pleasent to be inside."	2	1		2																					
8867	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph of, “Winter Hibiscus”, because it takes us back to things that happened in the story. Saeng failed the test before. In the spring the hibiscus will be budding again. Saeng realized that many of the things she thought were strange, were almost familiar to her now. The calls of the snow geese were almost familiar to her. The snow melting will tell her that it is now spring. Some of the things that might happen as a result of spring coming might be that @PERSON1 will past the test. Her mother will be proud of her. Also, Saeng will start to become a customed to her new country and her new surrounding and stopremenising about her life back in Vietnam."	2	2		2																					
8870	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph helps bring to story to a closing. In the paragraph she is basically saying when the geese return and my flower is budding I'll be prepared enough to take the test. She'll be prepared because she'll be adapted enough and she'll have experienced enough just like the plant and the geese. She Is comparing her life to the lives of the geese and the life of her flower.	2	1		2																					
8877	4	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because in the paragraph there is a lot said that is the main part of this story. For example all the names and talks about the seasons and there comparisions and differences and it talks abouts different buddings like when you get your mids your nuggets and headies of the plant. Because hibiscus is a new form of some nice @CAPS1.	0	0		0																					
8881	4	"the author concludes the story this way because Saeng failed the test, the hibiscus comforts her, and she feels she is similar to the geese. For example, Saeng says “I-I failed the test.” She has admitted to failing the test and is upset about it and wants to “take that test again."" @CAPS1, Saeng says,"" And that rich sweet scent- that was familiar, too, “while describing the hibiscus. The familiarity of the plant comforts her and will allow her to build up the courage to “take the test again.” Finally, at one point Saeng thinks to herself, ""the quiet repetition of season opon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese.” Saeng feels similar to the geese in this way and this allows her to decide to take the test “ when the snow melts and the geese return.” The author concludes the story strongly, describing how Saeng failed the test, how the hibiscus comforts her and she feels similar to the geese."	2	3		3																					
8886	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to snow that just because you fail once you  shouldn’t give up.  From  what  was  expressed  it  the  paragraph it  was  implied to me that Saeng  will become  stronger by spring and be able to pass the test .	1	1		1																					
8891	4	"By ending the story with the idea of retaking a test in the spring, the author sets a feeling of starting fresh and perservering . for example , when the author says” when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding ,”she show the idea of starting a fresh new life in the spring by returning to their home and the hibiscus is starting fresh by  budding again. This is why spring is when saeng wants to start fresh and retake the test. The paragraph also shows that saeng, like the hibiscus, is perservering. The hibiscus is perservering by making it through the winter and blooming again while saeng   is perservering by retaking the test. The author ends with this paragraph to show that saeng is not going to give up. "	3	3		3																					
8892	4	"The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph because Saeng feels most comfortable taking the test again when what she explained happens. Saeng misses where she came from alot. She promised herself that she would take the test again when that happens. With Saeng saying that it makes you wonder why she wont take the test again the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. It makes her feel really comfortable when that does happen."	1	1		1																					
8894	4	"The author concludes the story with his par paragraph because. She will take the test in the spring and she will do her best. She said “I-I failed the test,” Saeng said. By failing a test. doesn’t mean. that its not end of everthing. She will have more confidence next time she take the test."	1	1		1																					
8896	4	"The auther concludes with that paragraph because. it shows that despite her sorrow and discomfort, Saeng is able to remain hopeful. In the story, Saeng sees a hibiscus which makes her very homesick for her native country of Vietnam. The reader also leans that she failed a test and feels at of place. However, the hibiscus symbolizes hope and comfort. The auther chooses to conclude with that paragraph because despite Saeng’s hardships, the hibiscus helps her realize that she can overcome he obstacles and be hopeful of the future."	2	2		2																					
8899	4	"The author concludes the story with that because the hibiscus started budding and she’s happy now. So she’s saying after the geese come back and the snow melt, she’s to do all over again."	0	0		0																					
8901	4	the author added that sentence to the story to show how much Saeng cared about the snow and the plants. She says that she much rather do gardening then school work. She loves planting new things.	0	0		0																					
8905	4	"I belive the author concludes with that quote for an assortment of reasons. One is to show that the charecter isn’t just going to give up, that her failing wasn’t the end for her. This shows sorting like morale of never giving up. It feels as the character is referring to the hibiscus as sensely. “The hibiscus will be budding”   which means that she herself will branch out and learn more. By the spring time she would have learned enough and experienced enough to try to pass the test again. The hibiscus also reminds her of her home. When she will look at it she will find the courage to pull through and to face her challenges like her test.The ending quotealso wraps up the story.It also shows the charecters will of not giving up and to always try."	2	2		2																					
8909	4	"The author had concluded this story with this paragraph to make it as if they were on a clean slate like they had started over. So the past no longer haunts them. Saeng sounds as if she has a bit of relief after she takes her mom the plate. I believe that she feels better because at the end of the paragraph she sounds sure of herself. She sounds certain she sounds as if she want to start over because she says ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. To me she sounds like a brand new person. Who has forgotten about the past."	1	2		2																					
8915	4	"I think that the included that because she is compareing her slef as a flower. When she grows again like a flower she will go prove to past that test. She’s saying there always a second chance. She want to tell everyone that it’s to miss or a misake. For an example “they said there were many of things that she had thought of strangely, season up seson."	2	1		2																					
8920	4	I think the author wanted to express Saeng when she took a vowed and to express the way he felt. When the statement was made that also I think it was to make readers feel interest in it but mainly to help understand.	0	0		0																					
8924	4	"The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to show that the girl had adapted to her new country. Saeng missed her home. It was hard for her to say her country’s home without crying. ""It’s not like the wind we had at-at-."" She also spent @MONEY1 on a plant because it remind her of back at home. One could inter she adapted because she was familiar with the season change and it states when the geese return she is going to take the test again."	1	2		2																					
8929	4	"The author concludes the story with in the spring when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is  budding then I will take that test again, because she is saying there will be a new year. For example he failed it the first time she will wait until she tries again. Another example she just want to try until she get her driving license."	1	1		1																					
8931	4	"The authors concludes that in the paragraph. I think he concluded that in these because it shows alot of confidence about her. For example when she said, “then I will take that test again”. It sounded very confident and made it where she can want to try if she or he fails the first time."	2	3		3																					
8932	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she has not given up on her dreams.	1	1		1																					
8933	4	"Hope, a new beginning, adjustment-all are reasons why the speaker concludes by saying “when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” That hibiscus flower gives that girl hope because it remind her of her grandmother and back home, how wonderful things were back there, and by the flower blooming, she realize it could wear out there too. She’ll also have a new beging in the spring, by spring she should adjust to her surrounding and have new friends, things to do, and new memories to look back on, that looking backabout flawall won't be as bad the flower will bring her hope and comfort with her adjustment."	2	2		2																					
8934	4	The author is saying that she’s not doing nothing intell it is a nice day outside. Also she want it to be not that cold but not that not for she can come out and play with her children. Then she said she will take her test again for a nice day outside for her.	1	1		1																					
8955	4	"After Saeng fails her driver’s test, she gives up hope for the future. The sight of the hibiscus plant reminds her to never give up, no matter how tough the situation. In the story, Saeng’s mother says, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters.” This quote shows how even though its not an object of beauty, it can do what it takes to survive. Saeng feels that she is also like the hibiscus, having the strength to be able to survive in a new environment. Even though she is new to this country, Saeng had proved that no matter how big the situation, anything can be overcomed if you believe in yourself and your family."	2	3		3																					
8956	4	The author probably used this as the last paragraph to show that at this time next year she is going to take the again. The author writes this paragraph to show that she failed the test when the geese were going away for winter and the hibiscus was blooming.	1	1		1																					
8958	4	She concludes with this the story this paragraph because she wants @DATE1 to come again. She says “when the snow melts”. She wants to look at the events again. and take care of them.	0	0		0																					
8968	4	The author's conclusion to the story shows how Saeng interpreted the experience of that day. She uses a spring time setting to show when her confidence in herself is reborn. Seeing her hibiscus bud in the spring will giver herself and newfound integrity to go try that driving test again.	1	2		2																					
8969	4	"Hope, positivness, helpful all are reasons the author concludes the story with this paragraph. First, the last paragraph gives the readers a sense that Saeng has hope. I felt that she had hope because she is willing to take the test again. Since she is going to take the test again she wants to  help her mother. Second, the last paragraph gave me the feeling that Saeng has a positive attitude. She bought a flower to replace the dead ones, and she stated that she will re-take the test in the spring. Third, Saeng is helpful to her mother. Saeng finished digging the hole for the new flower for her mother, so her mom could go make dinner. Saeng also saw the feeling her mom felt when she found out Saeng did not pass the test. So she is re-taking the test. Saeng was feeling just about what any other new kid probably would have felt. She was scared, but through everything Saeng had hope, a positive attitude, and she was helpful."	2	2		2																					
8975	4	She will try gardning again after the geese and flowers return. She wants to have the best garden around. She wants to keep the tradition going.	0	0		0																					
8976	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph cause. Saeng didn’t think the winter hibiscus was In the ground now and that when she got back all of her plants was gone do to the snow so she said she will take that test again meaning she will start back to the first steps of her plants and flowers.	0	0		0																					
8977	4	"The author concludes, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because Saeng doesn't want to give up yet. In the story Saeng mumbled, ""I mean, not like the kind at-at- ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home. ""Saeng was still upset because she misses her home in Vietnam. When Saeng puts the hibiscus in the ground she feels more alive and Saeng wants to feel at home in the United States. Saeng isn't going to give up driving but to try, harder and harder to pass the test."	1	2		2																					
8979	4	"“When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The story “winter hibiscus” ended with this paragraph because it will be a fresh start for Saeng. It will be spring out and the geese will come back to her home where she lives now, which now has the hibiscus to remind her of her old home. The paragraph also compares Saeng to the hibiscus. In the story her mother says, “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it is strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters.” Saeng is the winter hibiscus that’s strang enough to make it through winter and failing the test won’t matter until spring when she will take it and pass. That’s represented when the hibiscus is in bloom. I also think the story ended this way because it ties in Saeng’s feelings throughout the story of her new home and old home. It’s also showing her ability to conquer obstacles. She is going to forget about failing the driving test and work to pass it in the spring."	3	3		3																					
8981	4	"The author chose to end the story this way for several reasons. Some of the reasons is that it creates a feeling of hope in the reader, tells us we always have another chance and the importance of persistence. The ending paragraph creates a feeling of hope since it shows how everything will return and others will be another chance. The author chose to put this in the text since it creates a happy note to end on and give the reader happiness of knowing there is hope. Another reason the author chose to end the story with this paragraph is that it tells the reader that you always get another chance no matter what you do. The author wanted to impart this on the reader since it is an important lesson to know. The ending also tells the reader that persistance is very important in life and almost essential to live. The author shows this by talking about the snow melting, the geese returning and the flower blooming which are things that happen constantly and almost stop because they refuse to give up and die. Therefore, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph for several reasons. The author chose to end it this way since the paragraph gives a lot of hope to the reader and gives the idea of a second chance. The author also chose to end with this paragraph since it has several analogies to persistance which is vital in life.   "	3	3		3																					
8985	4	"The auther concludes the story with, “when they cam back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and tis hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.

Most authors conclude their storys like this so the reader is in control about the ending."	1	1		1																					
8987	4	The author choose to end the story with that paragraph for emotional meanings. The last paragraph is saying she will re-take the test when the hibiscus is blooming in the spring. She hopes that the blooming hibiscus will give her strength to pass the test. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland and gives her comfort. Saeng hopes the sight of the blooming hibiscus will remind her of her home and give her strength to pass the test.	2	1		2

Being more confident and more adjusted is the reason why she has become stronger, and the reason why she wants to take the test again is because she is stronger."	2	2		2

9016	4	"I believe there is a meaningful reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think that the author will feel more confortable and ready to take the test. I was able to come to this conclusion because by waiting for winter to be over to take the test again, she is giving herself time to prepare. Also, she is waiting for the hibiscus plant to bud. Something. I was able to extract from the fact that she wants to wait for the hibiscus is the presence of confort, the whole story revolves around how saeng was able to confort herself by reminiscing on her past experiences in Vietnam. When she feels that an important part of her life is returning, that she can become comfortable and focused. I think the author would conclude the story with this paragraph is because the author wants to stress the importance of this flower involving how saeng lives her life"	3	3		3

9042	4	"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho. I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it emphasiseS that Saeng is willing to retake the test when it comes back.

When around the hibiscus it brings back memorys of the flowers that   they used to have where they lived. Both the mother and the daughter appreciate the flower they found because it is similar to what they had back home. For example, in the story the mother says “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” This shows that they appreciate its similarity to the old hibiscus.

9075	4	"Minfong Ho concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus” with a strong paragraph to show the passion and will of Saeng in her new home to complete the test. When the closing sentences states that Saeng “vowed” to pass the test, it shows her determination to fight. This will could be from the memories of her grandmother and the flowers that reminded her so closely of her old home. Saengs courage to face her homesickness is the seed of the story, and by ending it with such a bold statement, Minfong Ho blooms this seemingly sad tale into a story of willpower and drive to pass her test. “Winter Hibiscus” is a passage of heartache, despair, and yerning for a past life. By closing the story with the uplifting promise from Saeng, Minfong Ho puts a happy ending to a possibly sad tale."	3	2		3

Also it ends on a good note, if was like I stayed up in my @CAPS1 crying that would not be good ending. This ending gives hope to the reader and it also tells the reader to practice. This is because when spring comes a end the lady is going to practice driving so when she takes the test she want fail. Also the girl is getting happier at the end and that makes the reader happy. So in conclusion that ending for story has a good choose for many reasons, like making the reader happy, giving the reader couage to never give up, end to practice something if you fail it the first time. Also to help your mother when she is planting or digging up plant,"	2	2		2

That’s why the author concluded the story that way.	1	1		1																					
9088	4	"The author ended the story with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test in the spring, because he wanted to show that the geese and the hibiscus plant represent a sort of rebirth or revival to Saeng. He wanted to end the story on a positive note. Spring is an archotyal season. It is a season of birth and growing. Saeng saw the hibiscus after she failed the first test. It took her to her memories back in Vietnam, which comforted here she believes that maybe when she sees the plant florishing and she geese returning, she will experience that same revival again."	2	2		2

The hibiscus was the plant she found, that was closly resembled the one at “home,” to symbolize her conformt. The hibiscus symbolized her determination in life. “through the quiet repetiton of season upon season, almost familiar to her now” from this, you can conclude that Saeng is thinking of how she reconignzed the geese. It gives her greater confidence within herself. From this, “like the Geese she lifited her head and watched as their distinctive v was etched,"" and this explains that there is still hope inside of her.

She is also determined by saying, “almost reluctantly she realizes that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through a quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familier now.” This shows that she wants to do something and she doesn’t think it is weird anymore.

Thats what the author means when the spring comes. Spring represents a new life which is what Saeng & her mother are doing. Also the snow represents a blanked of the past / hard times. Last but not least when the hibiscus starts to bud that also means a new beganing. So if you put it all together you get the hard times going away when the snow melts & then a new beginning when spring starts & the flower buds  That is why the author put this paragraph in the story because they needed a fresh start.	2	2		2

9158	4	"I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because that represents saeng’s decision to try again and to overcome obstacles in her way. It is used instead of her saying “ I will try again next spring “ to show diction and to show her goal or decision in a different way for example, It says “, Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar now.” At first, geese flying in the sky was new to her, but now she’s use to it. Maybe the author is making a reference to the geese since it will be familiar (the driving test) and she will pass like she got use to and familiar with geese. Since her family came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam, she’s been adjusting to changes in her life and to circumstances. But, Saeng seemed determined to survive and overcome it. The paragraph is saying simply that she’ll take the test again next spring, but the author put that paragraph there to show diction by emphasizing the geese, representing learning something new, and the hibiscus, something familiar. It overtones the point in the story, which is to not give up and the will to survive."	3	3		3																					
9160	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He was talking for bout ho beautiful was nutura. He also thought sense Saeng loved nutura a lot she was going to go back to school to finish the test when she could be home in the grarden taking care of the plant.

9192	4	"Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because that is when she will take the test again. Also because the geese made her realize, that many of the things that she had thought were strange before had become familiar. Just like the geese. It was through the quiet repitition of season upon season."	1	1		1																					
9197	4	The author might of concluded the story with that sentence to show that she still cares about the test and not mostly about a meisly plant thats gonna die anyways. Also because she needs to pass the test and the author is putting in a getall that in the end the girl is gonna pass and not have to re-take that test all over again. but also he/she tells that because he/she wants us to know that it aint all about other things that are expensive in life but that school is really more important than anything basically.	1	1		1																					
9198	4	"The reason why the author, Minfong Ho, finished the story “Winter Hibiscus” on with the last paragraph  was due to in the story the girl went out on a test. And on this test which I do not know what the test is, she failed it and returns with a saebba hedge. This is a tamed plant for the family. The family loves this plant. They are what I understand from the story, newcomers to a country. And the country is @LOCATION1. They’ve moved here from Vietnam. She goes for her driving test and comes home failed. One of the things her mother asks, “why do you spend so much money on this beautiful plant when you could a had the famed bee-maags” which is the mother’s attempt to say a Big Mac which is their favorite fast food sandwich. But the reason why the daughter comes back with the plant is she has failed her parents on the driving test. She wants to go back and try again. “Then the snow will melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return to take the test again.” She believes the next time she goes, she will pass the test and that she will not be ashamed of it and that she will make her parents proud by passing the test due to it is a high honor to the family, I believe, from what I am getting from this. In Vietnam not many people drive and that they want their daughter to earn this and it is something they do not have."	2	2		2																					
9201	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to say whenever something leaves their home they always come back. The hibiscus reminds her of home and that is where she wants to go. Saeng had failed her drivers test and she said when the geese come back I will do it again. The plant reminds her of home but its, “Not like the tird we had before” (Ho).

9208	4	"I believe that the author chose to end with that paragraph because the paragraph represents new beginnings and starting over. When Saeng fails her driving test she has a moment of weakness, she feels lonely and then she sees a plant that reminds her of her home in Vietnam. In a since, the plant comforts her. “it’s flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here” In this quote Saeng’s mother tells her that the flower is too, out of place but yet has found the courage and determination to still grow. In the closing paragraph Saeng decides that, like the flower and the birds, she can also find the coarge to face fears. She deciedes to retake the tests."	2	2		2																					
9210	4	I belive the author was saying a new start. I say this because of everything coming back. I also say it because Saeng knows whats important now and will take it seriously. That is what I think the author was saying at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
9216	4	"In the story the author concludes the story in his last paragraph because he showes that even in her hardships. Saeng goes on and keeps trying to live a normal life after she had to move. For example when it says, “Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring I will take the test again.” This shows that even after one failuare you should never give up but don`t forget the past."	1	1		1																					
9220	4	"The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts when the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again”. The author does this to show how Saeng was able to slowly adjust to change while not forgetting where she came from. This is shown by using symbols of geese and hibiscus together. The geese represent the new home and sounds Saeng had to become adjusted to. While the hibiscus represents the old memories of her past and homeland. Putting the symbols together shows she has come to accept both places. By @CAPS1 that she’ll take the test again in the spring shows how she will be ready for the change because the test represents how she feels abut @LOCATION1 and by passing the test she allows herself to pass with @LOCATION1 and adjust to the change in her life."	3	3		3

9229	4	"In the story “winter hibiscus” by Minfong Ho I believe that the author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that if the Hibiscus plant has enough strength to come back and flourish than she has enough strength to come back and take the test again. For example, in the story it says “but its strong enough to make it through the cold months.” This quote shows that the hibiscus plant is strong. And Saeng sees that as if the plant is strong enough to return after a cold winter than she can return to the test after failing. Overall, I think that both Saeng and the hibiscus plants are very strong."	2	2		2

9237	4	"Saeng vowed to herself that when the hibiscus begins to bud again she will take the test again. The hibiscus symbolizes hope to saeng that things can work out a second try. She concludes the story with the vow because, it expresses her last bit of hope. For example, the hibiscus has comforted her in a new country, with new surroundings but it also explains how she feels. She vows to show she won't give up despite of falling the first time. For example, “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense , it was almost visceral ”(Ho). This quote explains what the plant meant to her. This is why she concluded the story with a vow.

9241	4	I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph to let readers known that Saeng is a survivor just like hibiscus. Saeng has not quite adapted to america and feels that this plant reminds her of home	1	1		1

By doing this the author is showing what Saeng believes in and that is no matter how big or hard the chanellge is she will keep on going tell she is done what she started. Because moving was a very hard for her. She had a very hard time communicating with peolpe and just tyring to make friends cause it is not always easy be new, by moving she took a another look at things because they were different on her.

In the greenhouse Saeng even breaks down and crys. The hibiscus flower that saeng bought cost the family a lot of money, but to Saeng it was very important. This flower represented hope.

Another quote that show Saeng is caring towards nature is, “she tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand.” This shows that Saeng is very caring to a small plant, which is part of nature.

9378	4	"The story concludes with this paragraph for a number of reasons. First, in the spring it is warm and sunny and this helped to end the story in a happy note. Next this shows that Saeng can adapt to her new home, as the hibiscus will through winter. Finally, it shows Saeng is determined and won't let her mother down. That is why the story concludes with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
9381	4	"The response that the author concludes the story with this peragraph because  the author wanted us that read the story to understanding what was going on in the story. like for the @CAPS1 they was sayin when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibicus is budding then I will take that test again, was tryin to see where everybody head at in the story so they can understanding what the author be talkin about."	0	0		0

9383	4	"The author included that paragraph because the hibiscus plant makes her think of where she is from and helps her to succeed a certain things. I know that the hibiscus is from her homeland because in the story she says “I mean, not like the kind we had at–at-”, she found that she was still to shaky to say the words at home.” She misses being home and this plant helps her bring back memorys of being there. Therefore the author included that paragraph to show the reader that she misses her homeland."	1	1		1																					
9386	4	"The author concludes the story this ways for a few reasons. One reason is that she will have more experience with her new country. She only left her homeland a few months before so in about six more months she will be more knowledgable about the ways of the new country. This will make her more capable of passing the @CAPS1 Ed test. Also in the spring is when the flower will be beautiful again and this will give her new-found strength that will cause her to pass. The few months time will allow the author time to mentally and physically prepare for the exam. Mentally, she will be able to study and learn all she needs to know. And physically she will age which will also teach her new things."	1	2		2																					
9397	4	"I think that the author concludes the story like that because @MONTH1 be she’s saying that by that time she’ll be ready to take the test again. Another way of thinking is that @MONTH1 be by that time when that happens in spring she would be preprared and more confident of herself. @MONTH1 be the author was trying to say that just like the begining of a new springs, it would be a new beginning for her."	2	1		2

9416	4	"I believe that the author chose to conclude the story the way they did because the story was about perserverance. For example, the story was baised around the winter hibscus plant. This is a good example because in the end Saeng vows that she will perserveer and take her test again and the hibiscus perserveers and forges through the winter not allowing itself to die. Another example that @CAPS1 mother worked outside while it was cold to get her gardening done. This relates to the story because her stayed out in the cold garden to get her job done, she could have quit and gone inside the nice warm house, just like Saeng could have quit and said she was not going to try to take her test agin. But she did not, she said she was going to try again. "	2	3		3

So she says that she wants to retake the test. So she is not being pressured into taking it. She is taking it to prove to herself no one else."	1	2		2																					
9443	4	"The author probably includes part of the story with the paragraph to put more details into the paragraph. The author trying to talk about the life that Saeng had vowed silently to herself in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again, saying that when flowers start blooming again and spring comes around again thats when I will take that test and pass this time."	1	1		1																					
9453	4	"The author concludes with this sentence for emphasis. It takes Saeng’s mind off of the flower and she focuses on her test. By waiting until next spring to take the test it gives her something to look forward to. This statement also shows that you should never give up on anything that you do. The author ends on a good note explaining this, The last paragraph is also a break from the rest of the story and from what Saeng‘s was just doing.

9476	4	"The author concludes this story this way to go over again the important things in the story. “I will  take that test again,” This is the test that she had failed that day. The test that she failed tested her memory of her home. Her old country was so important to her. The part in the quote,” when they come back.... when the show me it and the geese return,” is referring to when she says,” She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become … almost familiar to her. Like the geese,” She is saying that everything in this country she is starting to get used to like the geese that fly south every winter.” When she uses ""and this hibiscus is budding,"" she is saying how she will remember all the things she has forgotten when she moved over here to this country.” When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center –just as she had known it would feel.

9483	4	"The author concludes the story with the afore mentioned paragraph to represent the connection between the return of the hibiscus’s bids, and the return of Saeng’s resolve. In the photograph for question #@NUM1, the hibiscus flower is out of place, as if it doesn’t belong similar to Saeng. The hibiscus represented the link to Saeng’s past, as portrayed when the author writes: “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.” The hibiscus was native to her homeland, and by helping Saeng to remember her past, she began to cope with the present, and later the future, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."	2	2		2

And, saeng doesn’t have many friends go see at school but her hibiscus will remind her of all of her old friends she made.

9523	4	"In the concluding statement Saeng states that “when they come back In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The author concludes the story with this passage because she is using the hibiscus as an example of survival. The hibiscus isfrom another place like her, and she is using it to represent her well being in the new place. In a way she is saying , If the hibiscus survives this winter, than so will I. I believe she uses this as a conclusion to depict her unsure nature towards her new home."	2	3		3

For example she is sad in the story because she failed the test and want to go home. If she passes in the spring she might try to make changes and live here. This is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
9556	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a meaningful summary of the events in the story. Everything that happed to Saeng  while she was at the florizd  is summed upinto  something resembling vengeance. The whole reason that Saeng was sad in the first place was that she failed her driving test. In the final paragraph, she vows to take the test again when the hibiscus buds. The hibiscus that Saeng  bought will begin budding in the spring, when the snows melt. The last paragraph of the story gives roem for Saeng to dealhtith her nostalgiaover the winter season.

Soon the geese will come back and the snow will melt, and she will “return” to take her test and will  be determined to pass. Saeng  bought the hibiscus to feel as if she were back in Vietnam, and felt as if it could fill that place in her heart were she misses it. “I paid nineteen dollars for  it”. She  says it like she was disappointed  in failing the  test but also that saying which is free back in vietnam was so expensive in the united states. A hibiscus flower is tropical so when it blooms in the spring will be when she becomes ready to give the test a second try."	3	2		3

The girl was in a new place and back at home where she is from there are alot of beautiful flowers that she loved to look at and being in a new place that doesn't have these flowers really gets her down and has her upset. She misses her home so she is hurting and the only thing that sort of comforts her a little bit are the flowers. For example, the girl says, “It’s-it's not a real one...I mean, not like the kind we had at..."", here she stops because she is so upset that she can’t say home. The flower she has right now isn't real but when the real one blossom in the spring, seeing the flower will comfort her and give her confidence to retake the test."	2	2		2																					
9608	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows the character, Saeng , was going to adapt to their new home and stay strong. I believe, when Saeng’s mother says, “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus,’’ I think Saeng’s mother is also sort of thinking about Saeng Its almost as if she’s saying that the move here scarred Saeng but she will be strong and survive the change likes anyone who has failed a test, she will study more and try hander to pass it next time. Saeng  isn’t going to give up and she’ll keep holding on to make it through Saeng knows it’s hard to adjust to changes to life’s but with a little courage and hard work, it will be a breeze. If she believes in herself, she’ll be able to get situated in this new place."	2	3		3																					
9609	4	"when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. That is in there for many reasons. One is because when winter comes and brings all the snow it kills her garden. So thats why she wants it to be spring again so she can start growing things agian in her garden. She got to take a test on the things that she is growing to make sure it is @CAPS1 for someone to eat it. Thats why I think the paragraph “when the come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”"	0	0		0																					
9612	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because that was how he wanted the story to end. He wanted to end the story with her talking to herself.	0	0		0																					
9621	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was taking a test. In the story there are some quotes to support my response “I-I failed the test” Saeng said.” This shows that she was taking a test about gardening. Another reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the story was about spring, gardening, and the life of it to them. The paragraph talks about spring, and flowers. The daughter and mother live off of the plants by planting vetagables, and fruits."	0	0		0																					
9623	4	Saeng was very distrout knowing that she didn’t passed the test the test and to her she felt as though it was a let down or disappointment. This sentence shows the ambition and determination that Saeng has so that she will be able to pass this test.	1	1		1																					
9627	4	I think the author includes this because she doesn’t want to leave her audience guessing about what would happen next. Then “I will take the test again.” This quote is saying she @MONTH1 have failed the test with the plant but she is never going to give up and that when spring comes she is going to try again. I feel as though the author added this to give a better understanding of how it feels to leave your homeland to come to a place you don’t no or understand such as the flower situation in the story. When she thought about the plants and how they smelt it gave her the old feelings that she had about her homeland and how close she was with her grandmother. She was so use to plants being free and growing rather than seeing them in pots and not having the room to grow. By seeing all this got Saeng to break down and cry. In conclusion I feel as though the author added the paragraph in the end for understanding and to all so let you no that Saeng @MONTH1 be in a new place with a new culture but she will never give up on that test until she feels that she has passed it.	2	2		2																					
9635	4	She ends the story with that paragraph because she wants to let everyone know she feels most comfortable in the spring. It also states that she can not wait for the geese and the hibiscus to start budding because it is her favorite time of the year.	1	1		1																					
9638	4	"The author concludes that because she wants to show that Saeng was not giving up. I say this because she moved to, a place where she didn’t like and knew No one. The author is trying to tell us no matter what don’t give up, have faith. At the end Saeng has faith in herself that she can past the test next time. She @MONTH1 have realized that just because your at place you don’t want to, it doesn’t mean you can’t go on."	1	2		2																					
9640	4	"I think That The author concludes the story with This paragraph to show that she does not want to give up on fighting her homesickness. The first time she bought that plant, it brought back memories of her old home and it showed how much she missed it there. By saying shell do the test again shows that she doesnt want to let ths defeat her in her new home and her new life."	2	1		2

It shows that she is not going to be depressed by the change in her life anymore. The hibiscus is used as a device for this story’s plot. When changes happen with the hibiscus, changes happen in the story. At first, Saeng is without the hibiscus and feels hopeless. When she sees it, she remembers her past and is sad. Once she plans it, things start to look up. She begins to accept the change when the last paragraph says, “when they come back... and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” it shows that Saeng is looking at her future positively, and with this positive change, the hibiscus is now beginning to bloom.

To show us that they will be caming   back again it will survive even though its not from where she wanted it to be from.

In the last paragraph she says she will take that test again. Saying she will find winter hibiscus that is how it use to be in the homeland. She’s hoping they survive and hoping she finds a flower like it because in that last paragraph it says ,”saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again,” meaning she hopes and prays she will find one like her old homeland.

9659	4	In the story “ Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the author ends the story in a well mannered carhoined. The author ended with that paragraph to show that Saeng was not going to persuade even though for away from home. She is in a down was spiral at the beginning of the story she had failed a test and the hibiscus test her feeling nostalgic. When she got home her mother greeted her with kinds words kind of acting as an anti-depressent by making her food will not peppers and bitter melons. This kind of made Saeng see the good in life causing her not to give up and be confident that she will pass the test.	3	2		3																					
9660	4	"Well in the story, Saeng  fails her driving test. When she is walking home she sees a familar plant, she then goes to a flourist and finds out the plant is called a hibiscus. She then buys the plant with the little money she has because it reminds her of her homeland and childhood. It also reminds her of her grandmother who she left behind so now she is connected to the plant. Also she sees geese fly over head heading south for the winter, so she says “When they come back,” so she means when the geese fly north for @DATE1. And when “the snow melts"" so when it becomes warmer and starts spring. When “this hibiscus is budding,” so when spring comes and the plant starts to bloom she will “take that test again"" so she says she will take the driving test that she failed when spring comes. She gives herself the winter to practice and get ready for the test . She vows to herself that come spring she will be ready to take the test and this time she will pass."	2	2		2																					
9661	4	"She said this too show the determination it takes to make it no matter how many times you fail you need to get back up and try again. She displays her courage in this way also, it takes alot for someone to fail something and to get back up and try again on it. She isnt willing to accept failure, and she's trying to redeem her failure so she says she'll try again. That is why she ended the story that way."	1	1		1																					
9662	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think the author did this so that people who read the story will know what she is gonna do next spring and they might make out another storie in so that you will know that she will take the test in the spring.	1	1		1																					
9663	4	"In the story winter hibiscus the author concludes the story with that paragraph because when the winter hits and the plant she likes will disappear and the flower gave her good luck so she said “when the snow melt in the spring and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.

When they ended the story I thought to myself how nice it ended. If think the author did a very nice job. She made it so that she snowed all the hard ships that Saeng had gone through, as if they were the harsh winter. Then as the author said, “as the snow melts away;…”,I think this shows how even though Saeng  problems seem never ending and harsh, that one day they will be gone and things will become beautiful again, like the flower budding. In the spring time. Also she did a nice job because throughout the story I could feel her pain. I felt as if I was there with her because of her use of descriptive  words like, “exploding, shock ,intense” and others to describe how much of a sudden was everything was. Then when she ended it, it was like she was showing us Saeng’s hope for a better future, even though things aren’t the way they were back home!"	2	3		3																					
9675	4	The reason why the author wrote the conclusion paragraph was to show that Saeng is looking forward to a brighter future. Saeng is hoping to see the geese once more that remind her of her homeland and that see wants to pass the driving. In this story I feel as though Saeng is a very sentimental person and so that is why I think that is reason the author wrote the conclusion paragraph.	1	1		1																					
9680	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story was mostly talking about the hibiscus. Saeng was saying that when it’s spring and this hibiscus is budding then she will take the test again. The hibiscus reminded her of her homeland in the past.	1	1		1																					
9684	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to tell the reader that Saeng is going to take the test again.

9702	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because the author is trying to say that Saeng is going to start all over again just like the hibiscus would. Even though you go through bad times in your life just step and do it over again until it becomes better. The author also concluded the story with that paragraph because the paragraph pretty much starts the story all over again that like Saeng was going do.  	2	2		2																					
9704	4	"Saeng vowed siletly to herself ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because her mind went of the track from think about a flower.

Her promisreaction from tailing was silentess for a long moment and didn't say nothing. Her never got mad. All she did was brushing the fragments of green off Saeng's hands. Her mother was mainly thinking about the plants as the day went, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the 'winter hibiscus"" into it. Seeing her mother caused a reaction of ideas, so trying to etch a image of geese. She sent a goat to retake the driving test again as she was getting use to her new. The intro says ""Saeng, a teenage girl and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. it never mentioned about her family"""	1	1		1																					
9710	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that the hibiscus is a symbol for Saeng. In the sping time the hibiscus grows just like Saeng. When Saeng got to the new place she was small and peuney just like the plant. “Its leaves quavering in the wind"" (@NUM1). This quote tells us the the plant was weak a peuney. If the plant was strong it would not be quivering. The fact that Saeng brokedown and bought the plant tells us she was not strong. And at the end the author uses that paragraph to tell the reader that the hibiscus is strong and so is Saeng and the can over come anything."	2	2		2																					
9714	4	"The Author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope and the meaning of the hibiscus to Saeng. The author also ends the story like that because spring is a time for new beginings and where everything comes back to life and starts to regrow so to say that when the snow melts and geese return. ""Its. saying its the right time for a secnd chance. I.t failed the test Saeng said.....She tore off a leaf shruddy it to pests”. that shows the dying of the hope she had or the hybisus symbolized it. So that’s why the author ended it like that b/c it shows new heqionqrys."	2	1		2																					
9716	4	"“When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself ,in the spring ,when snows melt and geese return and  this hibiscus is budding ,then I will take the test again” . The author concludes the story with this paragraph because this makes you think about the story after your done reading it."	0	0		0																					
9721	4	He concludes this story like that so you dont feel as if she was defeated. She is now more aware or believes she can complete the task. Also she has more selfconcious in herself because of the flower and now it reminds her of her home.	1	1		1																					
9722	4	"The auther concluded the story with this because just like the flower it will come back a new, and so will she. The flower represents determination, using the flower to show her own determination. Even though she failed her drivers test she still has determination to take it, and try to pass again. Even with failur she is determained to get over it. Just like the flower losing its buds in the winter and growing them back. Saeng is frogeting her failure and coming back a new."	2	2		2																					
9728	4	"There is why the author ended the story with this paragraph. It mean that when she comes back after winter she will repeat her tasks all over. For example she will dig, sen flowers, their customers. Then when winter comes again she will do it all over. So has steally the other is using different words to say when winter ends she will repeat her actions. That is why the author ended the story with that paragraph."	0	0		0																					
9730	4	"The author conconcludes the story with this paragraph because, the plant brings back memories to Saeng and she is sort of like the plant. Saeng can be compared to the plant by, she is starting out in a new area that she is unfamiliar with, as well as the plant. The plant is now being planted in the soil outside of her house and has to grow. Saeng has to learn to grow aswell and get better and prepare to take the test again. So when the plant is grown and adapted Saeng believes she will be grown and adapted too. In conclusion, this paragraph is a perfect ending for the story “Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho."	2	2		2																					
9733	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, ""When they come back,"" Saeng vowed silently to herself,” in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She buys the flower because she failed the drivers test. She has seen the familiar plant on her way home as she went to a florist shop to try to buy one. The flower makes her happy and reminds her of home. The author ends the story the way he does because it leaves hope, so that the story doesn't end sad. She still has hope of passing the drivers test."	1	2		2																					
9739	4	"The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, “It’s flowers aren’t pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months ???, this winter hibiscus. “It shows that the mother wants saeng to learn that saeng should be strong even I times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, throught the quiet repition of season upon season…” It shows that saeng realized that the new place that she’s leaving right now is almost the same as their old home – In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that saeng should face the new reality of the world. She should be  strong and follow the flow of life."	1	2		2																					
9741	4	"The author concluded with the paragraph about when winter turns to spring, she will take her driving test again for one main reason. The girl says this because just like the plant coming back to life and starting over, she will start over too. In the essay Saeng, the young girl says, “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” @CAPS1 Saeng failed the test the first time, She is going to wait until spring so that she can have a fresh start. In the essay, the “winter hibiscus” reminds Saeng of her grandmother and her home in @LOCATION1. This at first makes her sad but then realizes how wonderful her memories are and helps her to get through this tough time. Her memories are going to give her strength to carry on with her life and try her driver’s test again in the spring. "	2	3		3																					
9752	4	"I think the author concluded the Story with these lines because Saeng feels more confident. First, when saeng first saw the hibiscus, she was sad, but after seeing the flower, she got happy. Next, her mother helps her plant it and saeng is sure it'll be there in spring. Finally, Saeng feels better since she has reflected on her past"	1	1		1																					
9763	4	"The author ends the story with this paragraph because the season is over. For example it is starting in the winter the hibiscuses are dying. Also she is leaving and wont come back till she can plant flowers again in the spring, and she will come back again when she takes the test over again. In conclusion that is why the author ends the story with this paragraph."	0	0		0

9774	4	"Explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Cause it all make a little cent to concludes the story with this. Here why I think it does. The paragraph in the one of the main pieces to to the story. “In the spring, when the snows melt and after return,” all she say is is when the snow is gone and the grass come back, I will start planting again and she would be happy with it, “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again,” she went to put her plants up again and tests them to see how them over so she can do them even again. Saeng loved this plant so much that she can’t wait. But when it does she is going to plant a lot. That what the paragraph is saying Saeng is going to wait so he can plant a hibiscus. However, since she came to United States she loved the flower that very much."	0	0		0																					
9781	4	"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng makes a vow to herself. “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” this vow means that she will start fresh, make changes, and adapt to her new life. She want disappoint her mother and she wont be broken down by her memories. She concluded the story like this to show in the future how her life will change and how she would learn to like where she is now."	2	1		2																					
9783	4	"The author concludes the story with this last paragraph because it shows by spring she will be ready to retake her test. It shows that like the geese who care and come back, she will have time to study and pass her test. In the story the author includes this last paragraph to truly show her dedication to eventually grow to be comfortable in her new home and to pass her drivers test all in good time. Saeng wants to be comfortable with her new life but isn’t yet because of what one misses. But she knows that after this she can go back and try again just like the geese do often our winter. This was a very effective way to end the story because it really communicated Saeng’s message of dedication and longing to overcome her obstacles, her new home and driving.

9789	4	"The Author of “Winter Hibiscus”, Minfong Ho, concluded hes story with the paragraph about how when the geese are there, and the hibiscus is blooming, Saeng will take her drivers test again, because she wanted to end on a happy note. In the begining of the story, Saeng, who had just moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2, failed her drivers test. She had found a plant they had back in Vietnam, but it made her sad. “I mean it’s not like the kind we had at – at-"" she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” (Ho, @NUM1) So by ending by describing positive things for the future, Saeng could think about that, and get her mind off of everything else."	2	2		2																					
9796	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she needs to adapt to the new country. She wants to wait when the hibiscus is budding. The plant budding shows than it is adapting to a new environment just like Saeng. The story shows that Saeng is not used to the new country. she cries when she sees the plants because it reminds her of her old home. The plant also comforts her. when she addapts to the new country, then she will take the test again."	1	2		2																					
9798	4	"The author of the story Winter Hibiscus ends the story with Saeng saying a vowe to herself because it shows how important the flower is to her. For example, the hibiscus flower gives her determination because it reminds her of home. Saeng says “… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The hibiscus flower gives her confidence. It reminds her of her home in Vietnam before they moved to @LOCATION2. Therefore, the author concludes the story with that certain paragraph because it symbolizes the importance of the flower."	2	1		2																					
9800	4	In the story “winter @CAPS1” the author concludes the story with the last paragraph like that because when the season comes back around for budding she is going to be right back out there exsploring. She’s going to want to learn more about the hibiscus and what they do. And she can’t wait to start taking care of them as they start to bud. Thats why they ended the story with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
9804	4	"In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with “in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to make a point. She needs all of those thing to happen for her to be sound enough to take the test again."	1	1		1																					
9805	4	"The author ended the story this way because the plant represents new beginnings in which Saeng needs. Seang failed her test & needed some comfort. She went to the greenhouse & spent @MONEY1 on a hibiscus plant that reminded her of her home. It the same time the hibiscus plant reminded her that her new home is another new beginning. The hibiscus plant gives Saeng better hopes that starting over can be a good thing & that the next time she takes the test, she'll pass."	2	1		2																					
9810	4	"I think Saeng concluded with this story because there is always time to make up for the past if the past allows you to meaning that @CAPS1 didn’t past the test. I fell she met that “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to me this means that even though it is snowing outside there is always next spring to start growing back up the vegetable garden this also relates to Saeng even though she failed the test there is always another change we can make up for that lost and retry and try to succeed at this one."	1	1		1																					
9811	4	"The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with this sentence when they come back saeng vowed silently to her self in spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The Winter Hibiscus symbolizes her fondness of the place she used to live before. Its not a real one I’m mean not the kind we had at-at” she was still too shaky to say the words at home” when the hibiscus buds” she will still be fond of her home but she will have adapted better to her current enviroment. The geese will have returned to their home means that she will find a place to call home in this place one day. When she finds that place she will find herself ready to “take the test"" or do things normally. The author concluded the story with the that sentence to show that Saeng will eventually grow into her new life."	3	2		3																					
9812	4	"The author concluded the story like that because she was being positive. Like the geese are coming back she is positive that she can take the test again. She knows that she will pass the test. In the story she said “Many things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet reptition of season upon season, almost familiar to hernow” This means that when she had just moved here she thought that everything was strange because, she have not seen anything like this before. Now as she is living here to would get use to it because, she knows what will happen nothing will become strange to her anymore since this is her home now"	1	2		2																					
9813	4	"The reader thinks the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the girl is saying she will try again, and take that test. In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng, the girl tock a test and failed it. And she got this flower that brong back memories from the past and decied She tock take this test now that thing are going to get better again. Also when the girl saw those geese flying over her, she knew they will be coming back, coming back after winter in the spring, and when they do her flower will blossom, the one that brings back good memories from the past and she will retake that test and past. Those are some examples of why I think the author concluded the story with that paragraph."	2	2		2																					
9822	4	"In the last paragraph of the story, Saeng vows to herself that she will take the driving test again in the spring. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope that nature brings to her. She describes peaceful things in nature, like the geese and hibiscus, that she draws strength from because they remind her to her homeland. In this way, she’ll always have a little piece of her past with her. Throughout the story, Saeng relates to nature and pulls strength from it. Her mother has a garden, and she relates to it in that she has a different past, preferring natural foods like bitter melons over @LOCATION1. This final paragraph shows the hope that the beautiful nature from her homeland has brought to Saeng, helping her adapt to living in a new place.   "	2	3		3																					
9824	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because it shows the main character, Saeng, adapting and trying her best with her new life style. For example, when she vowed to herself in the last paragraph saying, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. This implies that she is putting more effort in to what she do in her new environment and settings. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show how someone is adapting to change."	2	2		2																					
9829	4	"The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with a sentence about retaking the drivers test in the spring, to express the themes of adopting to circumstances and determination to succeed. The main character in the story, Saeng, is a @CAPS1 immigrant. Because @CAPS2 is not her homeland, there are still many aspects of life here she is not accustomed to, and the story shows her struggle to adapt. For instance when she sees the flower “Madagascar penwinhle” she thinks “how strange to see it in a pot” because “Back home it just grows wild,” The last sentence of the story is symbolic when it says “and the geese return,” because the geese adapt to circumstances by flying south for the winter, just like Saeng is trying to do, and Saeng realizes their pattern are becoming familiar. The very last line says “I will take that test again.” This summarizes the determination Saeng has throughout the entire story. Not only is she determined to succeed in her driver’s test, but in other things as well. For example, when trying to plant the hibiscus Saeng observes that “the soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting her shovel into it. Despite the difficulty, though, she “Dug out a hole” and knows it’s strong enough to move it through the cold months just like Saeng will be strong enough to overcome obstacles if she tries. The last sentence in the story is significant. It expresses important themes and lends valuable insight into Saeng’s character.  "	3	3		3																					
9837	4	He  wrote this  because  he is talking  about weather changes	0	0		0																					
9844	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph I think because since the girl failed her test the bud reminds her of her grandmothers long grey hair and I guess that gives her good luck so when the winter passes by and the spring time hits thats buds start to come back out and thats when she will take her test again. Thats why the author made this statement the last sentence of the story.	1	2		2																					
9846	4	"THE AUTHOR MUST LIKELY INTENDED TO SHOW THE HOPEFUL ENLIGHTENMENT OF SAENG'S COMPLEX DILEMMA. IN THE PHRASE, ""WHEN THEY COME BACK"" THE AUTHOR MUST LIKELY REFERS TO THE HIBISCUS FLOWERS THAT REPRESENT THE FOND MEMORIES OF HER HOMELAND. THE AUTHOR ILLUSTRATES SAENG'S STRUGGLE ADAPTING TO HER NEW LIFE THROUGH A “TEST” OF PLANTING THE BUDS JUST AS SHE HAD DONE BACK HOME WITH HER GRANDMOTHER. THIS TEST REPRESENTS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ADAPTATION TO HER NEW LIFE. FOR THAT REASON, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDED HER STORY WITH THE PARAGRAPH INDICATING SAENG WILL INDEED TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN."	1	2		2																					
9854	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to end it on a good note and send a good message there not going to quit because they failed the first time.	1	1		1																					
9855	4	"I say the only reason why the author included that last paragraph was to show she was not going to give up easy. She was still going to take it again, she might get good luck from the hibiscus. Saeng was walking home one day from failing her driver’s test and she realizes that she recognizes a flower so she went to a florist to see if she can buy it. When she does purchase it she goes home and gives it to her mom and they plant it. So maybe it can bring back good memories from her home town or just good luck I think."	1	2		2																					
9864	4	The auther concluded the story with this paragraph because this shows that Saeng is willing to change and she wants to do so by the time spring comes. By change Saeng wants to feel comfertable in @LOCATION1 and be able to remember things from where she used to live and not have to break down and cry. Also the author use the geese because they need to leave home earely year and they deal with it so Saeng can deal with it as well.	1	1		1																					
9882	4	He ends the story this way to show that she wants to and is willing to overcome leaving her homeland. In the story she goes to a green house. She is in the green house to test herself. She finds a plant from her homeland and and it reminds her of her grandmother. She finds other plants and they remind her of her homeland and she cries. I think she had a real connection with her grandmother. When they left their home country she probably cried for days its like she lost a part of her sole.	1	1		1																					
9884	4	"The author leaves the story with those words, because it shows the reader a large metaphor in the story, although unfinished, it is self-explantory that the “metaphor” compares Saeng and her test to the perenial nature of the winter hibiscus. They both have something in common, which is that they both come back, Saeng comes back to complete her test, while the winter hibiscus comes back, buds, and lives again. I can relate to this, because I remember I entered in a triathalon, and my goal was to place first, I place @NUM1 overall, then next year came, and I trained until the triathalon came again, and I placed @NUM2, so like the winter hibiscus, I came back and completed my goal.    "	1	2		2																					
9887	4	"The author include these paragraph in the story because the it spring, when the snows melt and the geese return. I think the author is talk about winter when it snows and keep snowing until spring hit and then the snow start to melt a way because the sun came out. One reason, is the author is talk about how it change weather when it changes."	0	0		0																					
9888	4	She was upset with herself because she bought the hibicus and not the plant seeds. So she starts crying because she remembered how pretty their old one used to be. When the snow melts and the flowers start to bloom is when she is going to take the test again. The author ended the paragraph like that to show a new begining next year.	1	1		1																					
9890	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because 1. Saeng failed the test. @NUM1. It takes time for a hibiscus to bud. @NUM2. It sound like a good end i not and plus she would not want to take the test in the snow.	1	1		1																					
9899	4	"I believe the author chooses to end the story wit this paragraph because it symbolizes closure. The plant represent her home. But she realizes  by the sight of the geese, flying sooth that evenyone has to leave home at some point. She has now come to terms with what is happening and she will try again for her drivers liscence soon. When the hibiscus buds again it will by symbolic to her and that is when she will be ready to try once again."	1	2		2																					
9908	4	"The author concludes the story w/this paragraph because she really isnt worried about when they take the test again, she’s only concerned w/the plants she picked out. Also, she knows that it will be a really long time before she takes the test again so that gives her more time to study and get more prepared and focused. The author also ends this article w/this paragraph because she wants to let the readers know that since she failed the @NUM1 time she will be back again to take it over and nothing will stop the author from failing."	1	1		1																					
9920	4	"The author concludes this story with hope in this sentence. The begining was very negative with Saeng failing her drive’s test and her mother yelling at her. But when this sentence comes the reader is filled with hope for the young girl Saeng. The author does this to show that Saeng will adjust and will peservere wheras before she was so upset, @CAPS1 when she said, “I-I failed the test.” Then for Saeng to refound from this event, gave the reader hope and thats why the author did this."	2	1		2																					
9921	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author is talking about how there will be a new start. Since Saeng failed the test and in the winter the plant will die in the spring the plant will bud again and she will retake the test. Its a new chance to start things over.	1	1		1																					
9928	4	"The author includes the paragraph, ""when they come back...then I will take that test again,"" to show that hibiscus is a symbol of time. Saeng uses the hibiscus to measure the amount of time there will be until she takes her test again.  The hibiscus also symbolizes the power to get through struggling (stay strong). Saeng had trouble with her test, but the hibiscus is there to help push her through it to prepare her for the next test. The hibiscus also helps Saeng's mother push through her hard time of seeing her daughter sad from not succeeding on the test. The plant helps the mother try and stay positive and it also helps the mother by trying to do the right thing for her daughter. In the story. the mother decides to plant the hibiscus in the garden to make her daughter happy. The hibiscus shows strong symbolism and it helps Saeng and her mother stay strong through out their struggles. "	3	2		3																					
9929	4	This final paragraph goes along with one of the main premises of the story. To not quite and keep going in order to understand and be happy in this world. Saeng is taking this “test” to see if shes ready to change and adapt to her new environment. She failed this time. But when all is right and the hibiscus is ready she will try again to see if shes ready to let go of the old and be happy with the new.	1	1		1																					
9930	4	she said it because she didn’t do what she was sopose to so she said she failed her mother was mad for a second but then stopped she said I love it and asked if she wanted something to eat so the went inside but she took the task as a test so she said next time I will do it right.	1	1		1																					
9935	4	"The author concluded the story with saying that Saeng will retake the driving test in the spring to prove a point. When walking home from her test, Saeng saw a familiar flower and chose to make a delar to a flower shop. There, she saw many flowers that reminded her of home. she bought a hibiscus and went home. Her and her mother planted it, after saeng realized the flower could make it through the winter. She looked up to see many birds flying overhead and she realized that she has adapted to her life in @LOCATION1. The hibiscus has given her the will to survive and she knows she can adapt to life in @LOCATION1. The point the author wanted to get across was that the hibiscus gave courage and hope to retake her drivers test and continue surviving in @LOCATION1."	2	2		2																					
9942	4	"The author concludes the story with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” for several reasons. One reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the hibiscus flower will be adaptating to spring just like Saeng should to her new environment in the United States. Another reason is like the hibiscus budding, Saeng has began to grow older and much wiser of things allowing her to go back in the spring and hopefully pass the driving test. Lastly, in the text it says, “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quit repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This shows Saeng is becoming familiar and at ease now of where she is living just how the hibiscus flower adapts to it's place with ease and gets use to seasons."	2	3		3																					
9957	4	"After reading ”Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho. I believe Ho ended the story with that paragraph to support her idea of overcoming  obstacles. First after failing her driving test, Saeng was very upset and didn’t know if she would ever pass it. But after seeing a hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her home in Vietnam which inspired her. Second, when she bought the plant, her mother was a little angry because it was expensive. But, after seeing how the plant brought joy to Saeng, her mother forgave her. Last when saeng was digging a hole to let the hibiscus grow, it inspired Saeng to take the test again because she overcame the obstacles of brining the plant home and letting it grow. Therefore, I believe Ho end “Winter Hibiscus”, to go along with her idea of overcoming obstacles."	2	2		2																					
9967	4	"The author ends the story with the given paragraph to get across. It highlights the things important and familiar to saeng that gave her comfort, and uses them to essentially say that she’ll take the test over again once she feels better. The winter hibiscus was a plant that saeng remembered of life back home up to the story, so when she sow the plant , “a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung saeng ‘s eyes now swept over her.” Saeng was unable to comfort her emotions when she first saw the plant because she realized how much she missed her old life. The plant is mentioned in the final paragraph because when it blooms in the spring, the winter hibiscus will help fill the emotional void, and help saeng to try to take the test again. She also mentions the geese for the same reason, but in a different way. Unlike the winter hibiscus, it took a while for the geese to become, “through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Saeng mentions this so that she can get used to the strange and unfamiliar parts of her life, and to come to grips with her failed test. Therefore by mentioning   the things she does in the last paragraph, saeng uses familiar objects, foreign and domestic, to illustrate her coming to grips with her failure."	3	3		3																					
9972	4	"Saeng thinks that she has failed because she misses her grandmother. The hiscubus plant that she buys reminds her of grandmother’s scent. Saeng spent over @MONEY1 on the hibiscus plant. She needed it to feel a little bit more at home. Saeng feels she had very little time to leave her country, in “a blink.” Her grandmother would want her to be strong and not cry at the thought of being away from her. Saeng needs to think of the good and smile when she is reminded of her past. Saeng wants to pass the test. next time the hibiscus are budding she must not cry."	1	1		1																					
9973	4	The reason I think that the author did it is because wanted you to know what time it took place and what the weather was like then it also so tells you how long she is going to wait like till the snow melts and that is going to be while and when the geese live and return home so this is why I think she tells you what is like.	0	0		0																					
9979	4	"I believe that the author ended the story with this paragraph to show the persistence of the main character. I believe this because in the beginning of the story when she is walking home, she states that she failed the drivers test. In the last paragraph, she states that after winter is over she will take the test again when her hibiscus blooms. Her persistence allows her to push through life as if she was a plant trying to survive the winter."	2	2		2																					
9987	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to get the readers wondering. To show that she’s not going to give up on what she wants to do.	1	1		1																					
9988	4	"The author Minfong Ho ends the story talking about the test Saeng failed and vowing to take it again because like in the story the test was symbolizing like slightly moving on, just kind of starting her newlife and not living in the old. But Saeng couldnt do that. She bought the flower with all her money because it held memories for her. But I think as the story goes on she kind of realizes she can have both, her old and new life. I think she ends the story that way because she really does want to try again. She wants to be able to please her mom, and herself she wants to be able to move on and starts her new life."	2	1		2																					
9992	4	"The author ends the story with the sentence provided because , she as she was saying that when  you and winter are over there be the time again to get there gardening back to the test with the plant she had planted. "	0	0		0																					
9999	4	"In the “passage winter Hibiscus” by monfong Ho, the quote “ when they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again, it symbolizes @CAPS1 new journey in the new country she lives in. In the test Saeng is having a personal discrepancy, missing her homeland @CAPS2 she states “I – failed the test.” This test meant more to then she just failing. She was a test to her ability to function in her new country and she failed. The “ when they came back…” quote started above can be analyzed deeply as the snow being her obstacles and the hibiscus being herself. When the obstacles melt away and she buds into a new stronger person she will take the test again."	2	3		3																					
10002	4	"I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” ecause that flower budding would make her feel confident about everything. The reason I think this is because that flower reminds her of past time memories of her homeland. It’s basically like she has a little peice of home in her new home. An example that represents this is, “Not like the kind we had before,” this is explaining the new hibiscus is similar, but not the same as the one from home, so this reminds her of home. This is the reason I believe the author ends the story the way they do,"	2	1		2																					
10005	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph shown for several reasons. First, the author needs to conclude the story without leaving any questions in the readers mind as to what happens. This is achieved by incorperating the geese, hibiscus and her drivers test into the last paragraph. Next, this last paragraph adds a theme of perseverance to the story. The main character is driven to take the drivers test again through memories of Vietnam lastly, it adds to the character by saying that she will ""take that test again"", she is shown as being realistic and not overconsistent. These are some of the ways that the last paragraph enhances the story."	1	1		1																					
10006	4	"The author chose to end the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is starting to adjust to her new home and that she will not give up. You can tell that she still misses her homeland by her reaction to seeing the hibiscus plant, but also that she is growing accustomed to her new home because of how she recognizes the geese and will make the decision if when to retake the driving test based on their migration patterns."	2	1		2																					
10008	4	The reasoning for concluding this story this way is to state that the season of the flowers is over and is to be held off until the spring so that give the author a point where he/she can end the story and begin on a new one for when the flowers come back in the spring so inconclusion this is why the author ends the story with this paragraph that they chose.	1	1		1																					
10018	4	"The author concludes the story like this @CAPS2 the Author (Minfong Ho) is telling you what will happen in spring time. I @CAPS1 this @CAPS2 the text say's Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that the test again. This means that in spring the hibiscus will @CAPS3."	0	0		0																					
10020	4	"The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph becauses it symbolizes Saeng’s decision to try again. Things in nature are repeatative, seasons change but eventually they appear again, geese migrate but they too return and the author used this as a comparsion to Saeng’s decision to try for her license again. Just like Saeng the winter hibiscus was out of. As normal environment but was learning to adapt and that inspired Saeng to keep an trying even if she failed because the hibiscus was trying to survive the winter even though it was out of place."	2	2		2																					
10023	4	"Its the start of a new life. She has a new new school and a new plant, Its is like she has a connection to the plant, when it grow she grows stronger and more confident. That’s when she said when they come back when the hibiscus is budding she will be ready for that test."	1	1		1																					
10034	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she is trying to adapt to her new sorrounds. The hibiscus reminds her of her old life and it comforts her. So when she takes her test in the spring she will feel better and more comfortable while she is remembering her old life in a new place. In the story it says that she failed her test and then she bought a plant that reminded her of her old life. The plant brought back memories of her old life and that helped comfort her. The spring reminds her of her old life because the flowers in the garden are blooming, the geese return, and the snow has melted. Saeng feels like she could adapt to her new surroundings with the comfort of her memories of her old life."	2	1		2																					
10035	4	"The author chose this paragraph because it fit right like a good conclusion showed for example the word again it means that you did something already and it's over but you miss so you retry what you miss, but in the paragraph it's talking about the nature and how they want to test it!(""again"")!."	0	0		0																					
10039	4	"I believe the author adds this passage to the Story to represent determination and @LOCATION1. While Saeng is not originally from @LOCATION2 she is determined and willing to try and. adapt to our @CAPS1. While the winter was cold and harsh in many ways for her, the Spring will Bring foregiveness and relief from her @CAPS2. She will try to pass the driving test again to further herself into american @CAPS1, while the blooming of the Hibiscus will bring her @CAPS4 to home."	2	2		2																					
10040	4	"The author probably concludes the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng has realized she needs to be confident, and to also end the story on a good note. Also, the author wraps things familiar with Saeng, and things native to her new home into the last paragraph. At the beginning of the story, the girl seemed very upset and lost in this country, and missed her home greatly. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" But once she gets home, and tells her mother she failed her driving test, she seems to feel better. Towards the end, after she planted the hibiscus, she sees geese and she feels as if they're ""almost familiar"". The paragraph that ends the selection does a good job of tying her past (the hibiscus), her present (the geese & the snow) and the drama of the story (failing the test) into one."	2	3		3																					
10048	4	"I belive that the author concludes the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, was a great way to end it becase I think that she sees how much the hibiscus can take then she can take just about anything mainly the test. Also when her mother said “You what?” “Her mother stared at her incredulously”. Sh might have also understood that if her mum could get over being mad then she would over come being upset about the test."	2	2		2																					
10052	4	"The author leaves us at the end of the story saying “when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. The author is said that because the girl Saeng failed the test but still found something that remined her of her home. She was happy, but the plant were not exactly like the one from home. But she got used to it. The flower @MONTH1 not be the same but it’s an @CAPS1 flower and she is getting used to beining in @LOCATION1. When she goes back to take the test she will be ready and so will her plant. Her plant will full of life."	1	1		1																					
10054	4	"The author includes that paragraph at the end of the story because it connects Saeng to the geese and plant with symbolism. For saeng, the snow represents her troubles adjusting to @LOCATION1, the geese show her that she is, even now adapting to her new homeland when she geese seem familiar. The @CAPS1 hibiscus was pretty but the new @CAPS2 hibiscus, which symbolizes her since she came to @LOCATION1, is adopted to the mre resilient and withstand the snow which symbolizes her problems adapting to @LOCATION1. For saeng, the hibiscus budding again represents her becoming stronger and overcoming her troubles. She wants to go take the test again when she is stronger. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to connect the Hibiscus budding with Saeng overcoming her obstacles. "	3	3		3																					
10058	4	"In the story “winter hibiscus” by minfong Ho, the author is concluding the story with this last sentence because its showing everyone that the seasons over for the growing of the plants but when it comes time for the flowers to start growing again she will be back to take care of the plants because its her favorite & they are what she lives for now that she has to take care of them. Also the author probably put the conclusion of the story like that to get people interested in reading more of the story later on because your getting left in a sense of suspense, because you don’t know if she really will go back to the plants or just about them. another reason I think, the auther ended it that is because its still snowing she cares about the plans but she isn’t gonna worry about them until it is the right time again. For example she says “when they come back then I will take the test again,“ that’s showing she isn’t giving up on anythin she loves and she will keep trying until she gets it."	1	1		1																					
10063	4	"In ‘Winter Hibiscus’, the author concludes with Saeng saying ‘I will take that test, again, it means that Saeng will be ready as soon as the spring arrives and her hibiscus is all in bloom. When Saeng bought the hibiscus, she was sure that as soon as the winter passes with the coming of spring, she is sure that taking the drivers test, again will be easier to overcome the fear and grieving times in a new place. This means that Saeng is able to overcome her fear of a new place. This means that Saeng is able to overcome her fear of a new place. Saeng is also sure that the memories of her homeland will help her, too. In the end, its revealed that Saeng has become strong and has high hopes to see her success be fulfilled in her new homeland."	2	1		2																					
10066	4	"The author includes this last paragraph in the story, “Winter Hibiscus” to show that the main character still has hopes and has not given up on her new lifestyle. During the story, the main character Saeng reminisces on her not so distant past memories of her native home in Vietnam when she recognizes a certain plant from her country. This is important in the story because Saeng is still unhappy about moving to @LOCATION2 and she begins to cry as she walks home, having bought the plant, to her mother. “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” Saeng’s mother understood how she was feeling, and she was not dissapointed in her for failing her driving test either. Her mother made Saeng feel better by planting the familiar Hibiscus into the garden right away. The last paragraph of the story gives hope to the reader that Saeng will not give up her strength to live a different life in @LOCATION2 that she is not used to. “When the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” It is as if Saeng is vowing that in time, she will be happy with her new life, not just passing a driving test. The Winter Hibiscus stands as a symbol for Saeng to be strong in the new country while still remembering her old life in Vietnam.    "	3	3		3																					
10069	4	"I think that she was that way to say, hey I didn’t over come something and I’ll be back next year to take the test again like the hibiscus budding when she snow melts and the geese return @CAPS1 year."	1	1		1																					
10073	4	The speaker @MONTH1 conclude the story with that paragraph because the geese returning and the hibiscus budding @MONTH1 help her with her confidence. She wants to feel like she can do this test.	1	1		1

10086	4	"The author includes the story with this paragraph because since Saeng failed her drivers test for the first time when the hibiscus starts to bud it will represent a change in her life. Also, Saeng use to have hibiscus flowers at her old home in Vietnam so when the flower buds it could show that she has a new home. "	1	1		1																					
10087	4	"The author finished the story with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason for conclusion is that it is important for Saeng  to feel at home. When the hibiscus buds it wiil remind her of home and this will comfort her, when she feels at peace and at home she will do better on the test."	1	1		1																					
10097	4	"I think that the author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because she wanted us to see that Saeng was not giving up Saeng was originally from Vietnam but she moved to the United States. She missed being home so much because nothing was the same. “It’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. ‘I mean, not like the kind we had at-at'. She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home. “But once Saeng finally realized that she was beginning to adapt to the life in the United States, she decided that she was going to give the drive’s test one more try. “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."""	2	2		2																					
10107	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph before they were talking about the “winter hibiscus” and the geese. So the author just simply writes another concluding paragraph that just wraps the story up, and the reader walkes away with a feel good feeling."	1	1		1																					
10111	4	"The reason why the said she will wait til spring to take the test again, is to see if she’s still like the bitter melon over the Big-mac."	0	0		0																					
10127	4	"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” included the last paragraph to convey to readers that she will be moving on, but still remembering her old country. Before finding the flower, the author terribly missed her old country. ""It’s-it’s not a real one, ‘Saeng mumbled. 'I mean not like the kind we had at-at’ she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burst into tears again."" She missed her home in the other country and was having trouble getting past it. The author could not accept her new country as home yet. Saeng, the hibiscus flower brought back memories of her old country, making it even more difficult to move on.” One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb."" The flower was too much of a memory. She finally had something from home that she could hold. “Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold onto.” The author now had a solid thing to remind her of home. This was the first step to finally moving on. Now Saeng needed some time to get use to her new country. “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.” Saeng needed just a little more time, almost like a hibernation. She decided once the hibiscus came out of hibernation, and was ready to bloom, she would be ready to accept her new country and move on. Saeng decide the time between fail and spring would be long enough to adjust to her new life. By taking the test, Saeng will be moving on. The author included this last paragraph so that readers can infer that Saeng will take the last steps towards acceptance of her new country and move on by taking the test, although she will look back on her old country through the winter hibiscus."	3	3		3																					
10129	4	"The author ended the story with an unconcluded ending. What I mean is the author wrote so that he could keep readers interested so that they would want to read his other books. Also, with an ending of that sort it kind of leaves room for improving and room for a sequal."	1	1		1																					
10130	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up until she successfully passes the task he mother gives her.Saeng fails the test because, though she buys a beautiful plant it is much to expensive. “But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn’t cost that much!” Saeng becomes very upset and realizes that she has failed her mother. Saeng still plants the winter hibiscus in the ground. “Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.” This shows that even though she had failed she wasn’t going to give up on the hibiscus because it represented her home. It was very special to her."	1	1		1																					
10132	4	"I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows that the character in the story is starting to adapt to her new country. In the beginning of the story the character ” Saeng” is feeling homesick and has not adapted to her new country. She is on her way home from her driver’s test, which she just failed, and on the way she sports a hibiscus in a flower shop. The hishiscus is special to her because it reminds her of her home country of Vietnam. For Saeng the hibiscus represents comfort in time of disappoint, connection to her past experiences and ability to overcome obsticales. Saeng has not adjusted to this change in her life and it has affected her badly. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because he wanted to show the reader that there will always be changes and obsticates in your life but there will always be something or someone that will help you overcome it. The author shows this by concluding the story with this paragraph and showing the reader that saeng was the hibiscus as her way of overcoming and when she is ready and she has ajusted she will take her driving test again."	3	2		3																					
10135	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph because when she come back from taking driver's test on the way home she saw winter hibiscus that was so beautiful. Then she went to the store and buy that flowers and it cost a lot of money when she got home and her mom planting vejetable and her mom ark her what is that so she tell th truth and her know that the flower costs a lot of money she get mad with the dheredulously of her how can she do that - Saeng take a big decision that she going to that eventhough her mom mad she she love that flowers I guess because it remaind of in Vietnam. The author put this paragraph I think because that the geese return and the flowers is growth she will take the test again bease that when she buy is no flowers came out yet so when it came out she will go again just to let her know that you see the first time and waite when it growth than you can take the test again In my onpion that is a good ending and also it a good question too.	1	2		2																					
10148	4	"In the conclusion of the “Winter Hibiscus” Saeng notes how she will retake  her driving test in the spring when the snow melt sand the geese return.The spring is when these events occur along with the annual budding  of the  winter  hibiscus. Her family had moved from Vietnam to @LOCATION2, and she had bought a winter hibiscus  plant  to remind  her of  her  childhood. When it blooms, she  will retake her driving test because the body will bring her the hope of a new beginning in her life, and as a citizen in @LOCATION2."	2	2		2																					
10151	4	"In the stoRy “WinteR Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho, the authoR leaves the stoRy off with a poweRful ending. The ending was “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to heRself, in the spRing, when the snows melt and the geese RetuRn and this hibiscus is budding, then I will tRy the test again"". Basically the authoR concluded the stoRy with that because it shows she's poweRful, that she's willing to tRy and make heRself stRongeR, that she's willing to tRy again, and that she wants to help heRself. Text examples to pRoove this would be, “then I will take the hibiscus test again,"" ""Almost Reluctantly, she Realized that many of the things that she had thought of as stRange befoRe had become..."", and ""TheRe was a fRail, wiRy beauty to heR that touched Saeng deeply."" All those statements help backup why the authoR might leave such poweRful paRagRaph foR last."	1	2		2																					
10172	4	The author concludes the story with this to show that saeng won’t give up. It is possible to adapt and try to love whats around you. Saeng struggled to get out “I-I failed the test” and couldn’t say “at home” this shows her insecurity and lonleiness for the new world around her and by saying she will try again in the spring gives the reader hope that she will adapt and love her surroundings. She goes through an expirence today that old life and comparing it to the one she is living in now they have some simalarities and because she will try again in the spring means she has decided to go to give a new place a chance.	2	2		2																					
10184	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because is symbolizes the hope that things will get better. The author ends with hope because the flower symbolizes the girl and the girl saying that if the flower can survive the year. So can she. This symbolizes hope because the girl is realizing that it is going to take time before she can adapt to her new country but eventually she will. This is meaningful because the girl considers the day that she had to be horrible and that this statement ends the day on a good note. The girl spends the entire day wishing that she were back in her own country and missing her grandmother and friends. But this paragraph is the girl vowing a promise to her self that she will withstand the winter until spring and it will get better when she can take the test again. The entire story builds up to this turning point when Saeng realizes that she will make it through this struggle just like this flower will make it through the winter. Saeng realizes that it is going to take time for her to adapt to this new and strange country and the new lifestyle that she must adopt	3	3		3																					
10185	4	"The author concludes this story with this sentence, because it shows hope for the future. This sentence lets readers know that times are hard now, but in time things will get better. Saeng might have failed this test, but shes not giving up hope on passing it. She believes she will pass that test in the spring, when the time is right. Saeng might miss her home, but she won’t tell that interfer with her future. That is why the author concludes the story with “when they comeback, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return andthis hibiscus is budding, then I will take that tests again."	2	1		2																					
10187	4	"The author chose to end the story in this way because it effectively ties in different aspects and principles of the story. For example, this sentence includes both the geese and the hibiscus, representing her new home, and the old, together in harmony. It also states that ""... Saeng vowed silently to herself... I will take that test again,"" which relates to the determination of the hibiscus flower, which struggles persistently through the winter. A lot of wisdom can be gathered from the symbolic messages hidden within that final sentence It implies that, though the past @MONTH1 be behind you, it is with you in your heart as you face new challenges, and if you are determined, those challenges can be conquered."	1	2		2																					
10191	4	"The author closes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is willing to try again. Even though it @MONTH1 not be right away, Saeng wants to try to see all of the flowers that remind her of home again without breaking down. She can tell that although her mother is understanding, Saeng has let her down a little bit. “But how could you? You know how much we–what happened?” when her mother says this, she feels that she has let her mother down. But then, Mrs. Panouvong expresses that she is glad Saeng got it, after hearing that she had failed. Sensing her mother’s inkling of disappointment, Saeng wants to try again."	2	2		2																					
10197	4	"In “Winter Hibiscus” Saeng took her driver’s test and failed it. She she wants to try and take it again in the spring.

10203	4	The author of “Winter Hibiscus “decided to end the story with this paragraph because its like a new beginning for saeng. In saeng moves and fails the test .The winter hibiscus comforts her from the memories of where she used to live. It gives her hope and in the winter it wouldn’t be as nice as it would be in the spring. Spring is also time for new beginnings because in the winter everything dies and comes back to life in spring .saeng feels she would take the test as a new beginning. From my personal experience I always do spring cleaning because I want to begin fresh. Spring is also filled with fresh air and gives me inspiration to do good. This could be why saeng wants to take the test in the spring time.

10243	4	"At the end of the short story, “winter Hibiscus”, the writer Minfong Ho includes somewhat inspirational concluding sentence “when they come back  in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.” I think this sentence was added in order to create a sense of hope for the future, which contrasts so greatly with the depressing nature of the story, creating a happy ending. Throughout the essay, Saeng is depressed she had to leave her homeland so hurriedly losing her childhood and beloved grandmother, “A blink, a channed switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone.” as Saeng narrates in deeper detail. Also contributing to the feelings of sorrow in the story is how much saeng cries remembering her tragic past. Im both the greenhouse, recalling the events of her grandmother such as when she says, “Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s grey hair Saeng would help knot the hair the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it."" and in the garden, when she talks to her mother and plants the flower.

10270	4	"The author ends the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to show a comparison. Since the plant reminds her of home, when it buds she will be more confident to take the test. When she was looking at the petals of the flower it said, “Gently she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least she could hold on to.” This shows that she really missed her home, and she had nothing to give her confidence. The flower is the piece of confidence she needs to feel at home and even pass her drivers test. Saeng felt out of place in her new environment. The flower hibiscus, gave her motivation. It gave her a chance to connect with a part from her old home, in her new home. Saeng thinks, “And that rich sweet scent- that was familiar too”. This shows that this flower was a sentimental importance, she needed. Therefore, the author ended with that paragraph to show a comparison and the importance of the flower to her adapting.

She was sad because she failed the test and when she buy the plant it probalbly makes her feel better. I think the author probably concludes the story with this paragraph because it bring some kind of hope to her, and she probably will pass the test.

10286	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of different reasons. The author wants to show with meaning, that the budding of the hibiscus plant will be symbolic. Ho states, “Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits,” This shows meaning because it is currently a point in time where Saeng has to overcome negative circumstances, and with the plant dead it shows symbolically the meaning of the plant. At another point in the story, Saeng realizes that there is much more meaning to the seasons, Ho states, “Through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,” she is realizing that come spring time when the plant will be healthy and budding, she will be able to succeed and become somehow like a new person."	2	2		2																					
10287	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he or she feels like the audience should know what saeng is feeling. This paragraph ending shows that saeng will keep trying every spring to grow back her flowers and this shows that Saeng has a lot of potential to make her vowe top herself successful.	1	1		1																					
10292	4	"The author used the concludes with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She wrights that because when her flower starts budding she will be able to take the test cause she is like a flower. The author uses the concludes because when the flower is going to budd and the geese come back she will think that she is back home. Thats why I think the author used the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."	1	1		1																					
10294	4	I think she concluded with this statement because she doesn’t know if she will pass but she isn’t giving up on the test and will try to pass it again when her flower grows back. Right now she feels bad and the plant helped to cheer her up so when she sees the plant next year she wants to take the test.The plant is like a sign of good luck. I think she concluded with this paragraph because it leaves you with the idea not to give up when times are hard keep trying.  	1	1		1																					
10300	4	I think that in the story “Winter Hibiscus” was a good story and also the author added the paragraph at the end because the main idea was like to work hard and that is why it mentions at the way end “I will take the test again” so you don’t fall and stay down you work hard and get back up and try again.	1	1		1																					
10334	4	"The reason why the author concludes this paragraph is to show saeng that she will be waiting for them to grow back and she will try again for her test.

Saeng wants to prevail she wants to stick it out and the rough times she’s going through make it very difficult for her. When Saeng says “I – I failed the test” this shows that saeng feels disappointe that she didn’t  expect that because she is a fighter, So the author ends the passage with saeng saying” When they come back, in the spring, when snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” To show how much of a fighter Saeng is because she’s determined to strive under difficult conditions."	2	2		2																					
10345	4	The author puts this paragraph last because it shows that saeng is looking to a new lease almost on life. She now has something to take her through the year that is ahead of her she now wait till it is winter once again to see the hibiscus flower bloom once again and as wel as many more to come	1	1		1

The hibiscus the helped give Saeng one step closer to adapting to her new home. It says in the story Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before, through the quit repition of season upon season, almost femiliar to her now.”  In the way the author ends the story it helps give inspiration for a new beginning and new season."	3	2		3																					
10357	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show how some some people vowed silently because the don’t want to express themselves.

The two reasons he wrote this conclusion paragraph is to give the ending a hopeful tone and relate the objects she sees to the spring. “Winter Hibiscus” ends with a hopeful tone thanks to the confident vow Saeng silently makes. She had a rough day, and the author wanted to make sure she had something to look as a goal. It also reveals how strong of a person Saeng is. The author uses this conclusion paragraph to leave the reader with a hopeful and confident tone. The second reason the author concluded with that conclusion paragraph was to relate some of the objects she sees to the spring. The geese represent the new place she is living in, and the hibiscus represents her old home. This paragraph links these two symbols together, so the reader can relate them to the spring.

Saeng had become sad because she remembered her home in Vietnam. She longed for her natural home and familiarity. Her missed memories agonizingly hurt Saeng because she was now for away and in a different world. However, the author started to reveal hints that @ORGANIZATION1 would accept @LOCATION2 and find come childhood memories there too. “Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and –yes- familiar to Saeng now.” Already, Saeng was growing familiar with her surrounding area in @LOCATION2. Her hibiscus would keep her @CAPS1 culture, tradition, and memories alive, as the geese would help her feel happy and accustomed in @LOCATION2. As one kept her @CAPS1 and “@CAPS3 culture alive through memories, she would continue a successful life and pass her test.

Later in the story, she plants the hibiscus outside in the garden with her mother. As her mother goes inside, Saeng watches the geese fly overhead. “Almost reluctantly, (Saeng) realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her.

""Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, it's leaves quivering in the wind."" By Saeng's mother reassuring her that she was okay with her choice it made Saeng grow as a person, ""I'm glad you got it."" @CAPS1 mother also says, ""look how root-bound it is, poor thing."" That in a way describes Saeng clinging to stay connected with her country. Saeng’s mother also tells her of now the plant will surely survive. When the spring comes the plant will be just as strong, and so will Saeng. Which is why the author leaves off where she did"	1	3		2

Also, it shows that nature gives Saeng strength by saying that Saeng will take the test again when the geese return, when hibiscus buds and when the snow melts in spring nature gives her strength because it reminds her of where they used to live and her grandmother. In conclusion, the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng is not a quitter, and that nature gives her strength and confidence."	2	2		2																					
10452	4	"The character, Saeng, experiences both internal and external conflicts. Saeng had failed her driver’s test and stilled missed Vietnam. The ending of the story was an excellent choice of conclusion for the story. The flock of @CAPS1 geese represented her changes. She used to foot awkward and out of places. Many things were new to her. Saeng realized that life isn't so bad for her. The planting of the “winter hibiscus” represented her change as well. It showed how she will start new and continue happily. Saeng will “plant a new seed.” The ending was well chosen for the story because it foreshadows Saeng’s future. The story is inspiring and the ending greatly contributes to the effect."	2	2		2																					
10455	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because it shows Saeng will not give up. Saeng failed her drivers test and as she was walking home she found a hibiscus.

When it starts budding, @PERSON1 will take the test again."	2	1		2																					
10460	4	The reason why they include the story with the paragraph is because they talk about the same thing.

10467	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” for several reasons, @CAPS1, Saeng decides that she is determined to pass her driving test just like the hibiscus. Saeng’s mother says that it is “strong enough to make it through,” and Saeng decides to be strong like the hibiscus and make it through and pass the test. Next, the reason the geese are mentioned in the final paragraph is to tie in the fact that she is getting used to @LOCATION1 because the geese “sound familiar.” As much as she misses her old home, she is adapting. Finally, one can conclude that because she mentions the plant, which symbolizes her homeland and the geese, which symbolizes her new home, that as much as she misses her old home, she’s starting to get used to her new country and she recognizes that she ispart of it. She knows that letting her past get in the way of her will not help her pass the test and, like the plant and the geese, she will return again."	3	3		3

10497	4	"Minfong Ho, the author of “  Winter Hibiscus ” concluded the story with Saeng vowing to herself that she will retake and pass her drivers test in the spring when the geese fly back and plant rebuds.

10502	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the authore is trying to show the reader that she realized cares about the nature and loves It so because she is waiting for the spring and as soon as the spring comes she will take the test again.

10519	4	"The author concluded the story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with the paragraph she chose because she wanted to portray to her reader that even though Saeng was experiencing a hardship leaving her old home behind, she could still find a good life with new beginning here.

Although Saeng was grieving at the lass of her past, she could still find happiness here. In the story she once knew hibiscus cran her did home. She finds hibiscus where she is now and it is a semblance and reminder of her old home. Also, the story says.” Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This quote leads into the final paragraph and shows her acceptance that she can appreciate happly live in this new home. The final paragraph says,”.. when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” When things familiar to her and things their remind her of her old home come back, Saeng will have the strength to try to accomplish good things for this new life in a new home again."	3	3		3

10548	4	"The concluding paragraph to the story “Winter Hibiscus” gives a sense of hope for the future. The girl, Saeng, has just failed her test and is feeling depressed. Through a series of event’s, her depression leaves her and she feels hope.“Then I will take that test again.” This final sentence shows Saeng’s determination. She was upset about leaving her home and she was upset about failing her test, but thanks to a flower, she got her confidence back. Whenever someone is upset it is easy to give up. Until the final paragraph, the tone in the story is depressing. When the author put in the conclusion, it was like a light at the end of a dark tunnel. The author is saying that even when things are hard and seem impossible, something will be the to lift your spirits. There is always a posative in negatave situation, you just have to look for it.

10549	4	In guessing that it means that when winter or spring or whatever its harder to grow that garden. Also mabe its a challenge of some sort to make the garden grow by that time of year. So I would assume thats what its talking about with it.	1	1		1

10558	4	"The author concluded the passage with a very powerful statement. “When the geese come back … in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.” This statement shows renewal and persistance. I think she added this because after realizing the plant can come back time and time again, even after the harsh weather, she knew she could do it too. She vowed to herself that when the day comes again she will be ready to renew  herself and get back on track. It conveys persistance also. The plant doesn’t die each season. It’s hardy and comes back. If the girl can be persistant and come back next year to retake the test, she will be considered persistant. I think the girl wants to be just like flower. She sees it as being indomitable, renewing and beautiful. No matter where the plant is being grown, it will always keep those traits."	2	2		2																					
10562	4	The author included this because she was showing that it was winter and the flower was goin to bloom and the geese were flying here because it is cold.

10574	4	"The author includes this in the paragraph to simply be sarcastic for you to know that it is almost impossible for Saeng to take the test afresh.

For example, if someone were to tell me take a test and I said whenever @LOCATION1 is president again, then I’ll take the test. That would be very sarcastic meaning that it wont happen and I’m not taking the test, instead of just saying No. The author included that just to let you know that the chances of her taking the test is very low.

So when the plant budds, she will feel like she is at home again and is happy, that is when she will take the driving test. Also, that paragraph shows that she is slowly getting acustomed to the new home and lifestyle, “A flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks deer and–yes–familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now, like these geese.” Through these examples I believe that the narrator put that last paragraph there, to show Saeng assimilation into her new lifestyle, and her acception of her situation."	3	2		3																					
10598	4	Ii think the author concludes the story with this paragraph cause the author is saying Its gonna be a @CAPS1 year or some change is gonna happen and he feels That could of did better than what they did and is gonna take that test again.	1	1		1																					
10603	4	"The author concluded this story for a internal adjust. Saeng's memories are expressed through the one at the hibiscus. The spring is a season where everything is fresh and new. As by spring, Saeng's hope would be restored and thriving, when the budding hibiscus, and the will have the ability to try at the test again with more strength and inspiration.

10613	4	"Coming back from failing her driving test, Saeng is comforted by finding the hibiscus flower. It brings back cherished @CAPS1 about Saeng's homeland, because it is very similar to flowers that grew by her old home. The author concluded the story by saying ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to compare Saeng to the hibiscus. Like Saeng, the hibiscus must try to adapt to new surroundings. The author shows that Saeng recognizes this connection and is inspired by it. In Saeng's mind , if the hibiscus can survive being moved, then so can she."	2	2		2																					
10615	4	"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, Saeng has a deep emotion connection to the memories and flashbacks that the Hibiscus brings back to her. At one point in the story, she cries out of mourning for her grandmother because the hibiscus plants bring back aware of memories. Later on in the story, she takes the plant to her mother. At first @PERSON1 is upset but then she becomes understanding of her daughter’s actions and feelings. Saeng is upset that she didn’t pass her test and her mother understands that. I think the author ends the story this way because wants the reader to see that because the hibiscuses is so important to Saeng and reminds her of her past, she will have a reason and motivation to continue and reach her goal of passing."	2	2		2

10623	4	"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” Saeng decides to retake failed driver’s test in the spring. She does so because she is comforted on the moderate weather of the spring. It reminds her of home, and Saeng is very closely attached to home. It reminds me of all the places I’ve been and how I still remember my favorite one. Like Saeng, I buy objects that remind me of my old home Saeng’s commitment to her old home makes me feel less different when I miss my old home."	1	1		1																					
10624	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is going to start over and do better the second time around because she doesn’t want to disappoint herself. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
10627	4	Saeng told her mother that she failed the test. She she what to make up for it. By helping out in the graden. Her mother usher in and started to make dinner.	1	1		1																					
10634	4	"She ends it with that statement to show that she is ready to relive spring in the new country now that she is comforted by the hibiscus. The test is adapting to the new country and she failed it she believes because she had to be comforted by her native plants, but she believes that she will pass the test next year because every repetition of the season allow her to become  more adapted to the new culture. When she says ‘’when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.’’All those things tell her it’s a new year and makes it easier to accept what’s happening.        "	2	2		2																					
10639	4	The author concludes the story with this because it shows that she is still uncomforalable. For example when she broke down in the flower shop. This shows that even though things can remind her of home it isn’t the same. You have to get used to and become accostumed to a new place. This also shows that she thinks with more time to get used to her new home that she will be able to pass the test.	2	2		2

Ever though he had his days I would say to my self ''you have him and have patience '' and to this day him and I are still friends.	8	8		16				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2								
17981	7	"Hi, im writing about the topic patience. I think patience is very important to the world. Because if no one had patience everyone would be running crazy like banshees and getting mad al the time. It is important to have patients  because In life it’s not always fair and you have to wait your turn. For example when I go to get my allergy shots I have to be patient. Because other people got @CAPS1 first and act to get served first. I also have to be patient at my football games because everyone has to play, and I can play in @CAPS1 spot the whole game. Lots of people that aren’t patient make other people not patient. Another term for not patient is inpatient. Everyone needs to have some sort of patience. That is what this world need, a little more patience. THE @CAPS2."	6	5		11				0	2	2	2			1	1	1	2								
17997	7	"This is the time when I was patient to my friend @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and me live in the same apartment building, so we hang out all the time. One day I had an @CAPS1 to go to the carnival. I noticed she wasn’t liking the @CAPS1 than she said “she was scared” of rollercoasters, but I told her it wont be a big deal, we will not go on big rides. The day of the carnival, came I was exsited so was @PERSON1, as we got there she was really scared to go on the on therides,so I told her we could go on the smallest ride. After we went oh a few she wasn’t scared as much. Than wall, we were walking she saw a ride, one of the bigest rides there, she said we should go on that so than I told her if she wonted to I we could go on it, and she was sure, after that ride we kept going on differnt bigger rides, wall we were walking she said thanks for having patience and that I was a good friend. In summary that was the time I had patience for a friend."	6	10		16				2	2	1	1			2	3	2	3								
17998	7	"There have been times in my life where I had to be patient. My friends and I that day had decided to go to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. I love roller coasters, but I hate the lines that come with. When we got there we had to wait a half an hour to get in. When we made the decision to go on the @CAPS2 ride first. Next, we had to wait another @NUM1 minutes to get on the ride. Other rides we want on too had a long wait. So throughout the day there was quite a bit of waiting. Even when we got food we had to wait with all this waiting it took a lot of patience. My friend and I had to be understanding and tolerant of the waiting and long lines. By the end of the day all of us had gotten used to using our patience. That trip to @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 taught me to be a more patient person."	9	8		17				2	2	2	3			2	2	2	2								
18006	7	"When I was ten years old my mom promised me a phone. But then she I had to wait until @CAPS1. That got me mad because @CAPS1 wasn't until next month. I couldn't wait because this phone was a touchsreen with a key board. But I tried to be as patient as I could. The next day I kept seeing these commercials of the phone I wanted. It was very hard to be patient but I tried my best. So everyday I had to try to keep my mind on something besides the phone. Also a couple of my other friends had a phone and I really wanted to text them. Before I knew it it was only a week until @CAPS1 so I was excited, even though I had to pay for phone bill. I just wished the time would fly, but it didn't. So all I decided to do was wait. After six day past, tomorrow was already @CAPS1! My days of miserable waiting paid off! So I woke up the next day and opened my present and it was a brand new phone! My heart started beating of excitement. I was so happy then I thanked my mom. So being patient will eventually pay off."	8	8		16				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2

18017	7	"Being patient is sometimes hard but sometimes you don’t care. There are many times I was patient. Sometimes I have to wait an hour or @NUM1 minutes. There is a time when I had to wait an hour. The one time when I was patient was at dance. My mom danced me off at @NUM2. I waited five minutes because I was a little yearly. After I waited five minutes I had worried that maybe they were in a different class but no they weren’t. After waiting thirdy minutes I was really bored and remembered that dance started at @TIME1. I could of called home but I didn’t have my phone. Then when five more minutes went by I went in the playset. Me and myself swinging alone. When I was @TIME1 my mom came to pick me up from dance but I told her, “it starts at @TIME1. So I have to leave”. She kept asking me why I didn’t call and I kept telling her I didn’t have my phone. Then she left and I went to dance for two hours. Being patient that long is humble to me. I can go fifteen minutes but I can’t go an hour. Thats one of the horrible times I was patient."	8	9		17				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	3

We have practice @DATE1, and @DATE3. We also have six girls including me. My coach loves to make us do the dance one time by ourselves .On our first game we had practice right before we left for our very first performance. All of us were so excited we all just wanted to go and perform all day. But the game was at @NUM5:45 pm and they didn’t even start until @NUM6:00 pm which was way later than expected. So all my poms team, our coach, and all of our family had to wait patiently on the bleachers for over @NUM11 until we actually, finally got to perform. Finally it was the @DATE2 and the clock bit three, which ment we all went on the track to stretch .We were all so happy but still a little sad that we didn’t get to perform earlier. We had a minute on the clock so we walked to the other side. Getting in our formation the clock quickley started to drop from fifty seconds to @NUM12 then quickely we only had @NUM13 seconds until we went on. I couldn’t believe it, only @NUM13 seconds until our very first performance.

I quickly ran inside to get @CAPS2 dog penny [she is real not fake] @CAPS2 dog bitted out the door and I put her in the truck. We stopped at @CAPS2 grandmas and grandpas house and rest. We travelled through lots of roads until we got to the highway. “@CAPS1’s gonna be a long ride” I said. We passed so many cars. Then they passed us. For a second we lost our grandparents car. I looked back and behind about twelve cars I found them. We reached @LOCATION3 in about four hours. I knew @CAPS1 was going to be a long trip so I decided to take a nap. Daring @CAPS2 nap @CAPS2 parents [@CAPS2 mom] took pictures of me. I thought that @CAPS1 wasn’t nice. We now have one more state to go through and then were in @LOCATION1. That state was @LOCATION2. By the time we reached @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 was already @NUM1. We decided to get a room like a hotel. In the morning we stopped and ate breakfast. Then on the road again. I had to be patient because we still had a two hour drive to go. Longest five hours even but I was patient so @CAPS1 was fine. We arrived in @LOCATION1 and had no clue where we were going. So @CAPS2 dad turned his gos and we found our way to our cabins. That is a story about a time I had to be patient.	8	11		19				2	2	2	2			3	3	2	3

18215	7	Patients in my way of saying is a person that waits awile if she needed to. The only reason im putting this in my own way is because know one is patient in my family. Pations is s person where if they were stuck in traffic then they’ll be able to sit and wait or there’s a really long wait or line. Or they’ll be able to wait for something they need. Patients is just waiting for my turn I should put it. Its about waiting if I have to or if something runs out and they have to wait for it to come and get it. That’s what patients mean to me in my own way.	4	4		8				1	1	1	1			0	1	1	2

18279	7	"A time when I had to be patient was at my dance audition. Every year at @ORGANIZATION1 grove college I audition to help pay for my classes. I was ready and pumped to go dance, there were about @NUM1 people in the dance room. I worked very hard when I left the audition. My teachers told me that we would get a letter in the mail telling us how much scholarship money I got. Every day I waited at the mail box hoping my letter would come. A month had passed and I still didn’t get anything. I started to get worried and I thought I wouldn’t get anything. One day when I gave up all hope a letter came in the mail for me and said that I only got @MONEY3. I was very upset because my classes cost @MONEY1 and @MONEY3 was not a lot of help. I wanted to quit dance but it was a talent I had that I wanted to keep doing. So I waited until dance started and my teacher told me that there was a mistake, I actually got a scholarship for @MONEY2. My mom was very happy and so was I. My teacher apologized for the mix-up and for it taking so long for it to come. I learned a skill that year that was, patience can bring rewards to you but don’t give up because it will turn out alright in the end. I also learned that patience is good to learn at an early age, because when I get older a lot of things will get in my way, and I have to be patient so I can overcome all of them."	12	11		23				3	3	3	3			3	3	2	3								
18284	7	"Patience is a lot of things. Patience is used every day. You can be waiting for a check, you could wait for a letter. Sometimes paitents can be fast or be slow. @CAPS2 can be used in school or even a job. If you wait in patience on standing things could happen to you. For a test you can use patience by waiting for an answer to a question by waiting a little longer to get the answer instead of going fast and not getting @CAPS2 right. Patience can be used in @CAPS1 in experiments  @CAPS2 could also be used in math to find an answer. When you are building a model you have to use patients so @CAPS2 is right not having patients @CAPS2 will be wrong. That is what patients means to me and everyone has to use @CAPS2 and @CAPS2 is part of your daily life."	5	6		11				0	1	2	2			0	1	2	3

18294	7	"Patience is the key to tolerating trouble, problems, and helps you to not make tragic mistakes. You need to be patient when you even ??? a challenge in your life. Without patience, nothing would stop you from rushing into a situation with an unfocused mindset. If you try to deal with something without the necessary amount of patience, you’re quite likely to make a crucial mistake and/or degrade your chances of succeeding and reaching goal(s). In situations such as sports games arguments, disaster, and many other occurrances, patience will indeed come in handy. When playing sports, being patient will be helpful when you’re waiting to get playing time, when your team is behind, and when your teammates aren’t doing their correct jobs and responsibilities on the team. Having patience, overall, will most likely help your team execute smooth, and by respecting sharing your opinion as well. Ultimately, this will help you sort out the situation a little more smoothly. During a disaster such as a house-fire or when dealing with tornado damage, being patient allows you to sort out all the things that you’ve lost, and you’ve enable to think clearly a bait what has just happened I’ve experienced a house fire so I know that being patient is a great way to handle and live through such a situation. Overall, I guess what I’m trying to say is that when you’re patient you experience difficulties without complaining. Right now, you @MONTH1 not think that this applies to you, but honestly, I can guarantee you that life isn’t a “bundle of roses” all the time, so soon or later, you’re going to need to use patience. Waiting carefully for things to happen usually isn’t human nature but its indeed a necessity in everyday life. So we all need to recognize the fast importance of patience, so we all can live better lives, I’m certainly not implying that we need to hurry up and learn this trait, no, we simply need to learn it patiently."	9	7		16				0	3	3	3			0	2	2	3

My dad always said I was going to catch a fish and I believed him when I turned nine I went to a friend’s home for a party. He lived by a lake. Every body except my family brought rods and feels. I didn’t have any thing to do, so I asked a boy if I could borrow his pole and fish while he was eating. He said yes so I walked to the lake and threw out the line. I saw something big’s tail come out of the water. All of a sudden a tremendous tag on the line almost threw me into the water. A reeled in the line bit by bit so it wouldn’t break.

18626	7	"“Patience is a virtue.” You might hear that phrase a lot if you dislike waiting on things for a long period of time. Here’s a question for my audience what is patience? Do you know? Well in my essay, I’m going to discuss patience and how it affects our lives. In this day and age, it’s very hard to come across someone with a decent amount of patience. Due to all the ``@CAPS1” services and goods such as pizza delivery @NUM1 minute wash & dty acts people have begun to lose patience. What our generation has yet to realize is that we need that patience to get good jobs and get nice amounts of money. Another reason people need patience is their family. If you lack patience you wont be able to deal with your young and immature family members. For example I have no patience whatsoever so I can’t deal with anyone younger than @NUM1 years old. That will affect me in very negative way. Those are the pro’s and con’s of having patience thank you for reading my essay."	7	7		14				0	2	2	3			0	2	2	3

Soon enough, it was @DATE1, and my two favorite bands and a band I loved almost as much called flipleaf, would be in @LOCATION1 tonight. The day crawled.  I wanted to explode with excitement. All I could think was what would happen later today. Every second my heart pounced until I got in my dads car at @NUM2. cool clothes, crack, tickets? Check. @NUM1 days of no complaining? CHECK! We listened to the three bands we would be seeing all the way to @LOCATION1. I thought my heart had gone back to normal but with each beat of life along they hear got louder and louder and almost in time to the pound of their bass drums.  Passed a limo with one window open, I swear I saw the singer of breaking @CAPS1.(@CAPS3 @CAPS4) feiceps. I saw the limo just as we entered @LOCATION1. No more than ten minutes later we pulled into the parking building for the @PERSON1. I got a glimpse of the long line of people waiting to get in. I reached into my bottle of patience, and pulled out the small scraps of what I had left.  The enormous tunnels the lines were gray and dras. We had to walk for a mile to get to the end of the line, and the line sacrues of, if ???? up of snails, but before I knew it, I was in . I had yet to complain. I was proud of my patience."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

When I was at an outdoor mail with my mom, two older sisters, younger brother, niece, and dog, I waited patiently to go to the @ORGANIZATION1 store to try out the iPad. When I did, I realized that the iPad is awesome! After ward, we went to get ice cream. My little brother got a root beer flavored slushie, my niece, dog, and I got vanilla ice cream. After I finished my ice cream I put the container on the ground and let my dog lick the rest from the bottom. We had spent @NUM1 hours there! What a surprise!

I had @CAPS7 @CAPS8 what else @CAPS4 needed until @CAPS2 stomach growled it sounded like a bear protecting it's cubs, fierce, and starving.

I packed turkey sandwiches, pb&j sandwiches, chips. Saltandvinager, sour crean and onion (caross) and jolepenyo ceddar(yum). Now I have everything I thought, ""of @CAPS4 go."" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 mom and again I rushed out the door ""got the address,"" asked @CAPS2 father."" @CAPS10 @CAPS3 I got it."" @CAPS11 when @CAPS4 started to go @CAPS2 sister fell asleep. @CAPS5 was sleeping lik arock the whole way there although, I don't think rocks shore. after @NUM1 hours of being awake in the car I thought maybe I should try to sleep, but the excitment was rushing so fast I could feel it then I fell asleep. I thought I would be able to stay awake the whole way but I was marked impossible. Finally @CAPS2 step father yelled ""wake up!!"" I was so tierd when I woke up, "" are @CAPS4 there yet, first thing that came out of @CAPS2 mouth ""yeah"" and, of course, the first things I did was jump up and out of the care! ""@CAPS12!"" @CAPS2 mother shouted. I paused as if I was a charactor in a video game and the player press pause."" @CAPS13 take in some off the bags."" ""@CAPS14"" I said with a scowse on @CAPS2 face. ""@CAPS15 youhave to be patient"" as I took in the bag there it was to condo of @CAPS2 dreams and the first thing I did was sleep."	10	12		22				3	3	2	2			3	3	3	3

18853	7	"Patience @MONTH1 seem easy but, however, it can be hard. Waiting in line, waiting for @CAPS1 etc. all requires patience. Everyone, no matter how young or old has patience just like I did when I was in @NUM1 grade. Each day I wonder if it’s a dream or a nightmare. Everyday when I was in @NUM1 grade I always wanted something that would change my life eternally. After @NUM3 year that wish would finally come true. I was very patient waiting for our letter to be granted or denied. Before I knew it my mom, dad, and I were on a plane headed straight for china. There we would see the great wall, forbidden city, and @LOCATION1 not to mention our main purpose to adopt a little sister. I had no idea what I was in for. I was patient for @NUM4 weeks then we went to the lobby and she was with her caregiver along with all the other families waiting for their child too. I couldn’t believe we were the @NUM5 ones to receive our gift from china. BIG @CAPS2! The moment my mom tried to take her she started warning, pinching, kicking, and who knows what else. After an hour or so she calmed down and she calmly played with her toys and such. That night we went out for dinner at @ORGANIZATION1. My dad odered a milk shake and he let her ??? some of it that was also a @CAPS2. He did not get it back until the glass was empty. We soon learned that she would be a rollarcoaster with her ups and downs. She loved cake and ice cream and wanted dad only. It was dad’s dream come true. In conclusion, you will use patience everyday no matter how big or small. Patience will work its way into your life no matter how hard it is. Everyone has patience, the question is, “will you use it?”"	11	12		23				2	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

So I lived in @LOCATION4, went to kindergarden, made friends, moved into a new house, and so on until I was seven. That is when I found out that we were moving. Again, back to @LOCATION3. Well, now I wasn’t four anymore.  I had a lot of amazing friends here (in particular two of them) and now I would have to start all over again. I didn’t hate the idea but I didn’t love it either. Of course. It didn’t exactly matter. We were moving anyway and I knew from the beginning that I would easily have fun and make new friends. The only thing I didn’t want to leave behind were the old friends, memories, and all the other stuff I loved about this place. So I took along my memories, promised to keep in touch with friends, and then moved. Novi was different but good .There were plenty of changes to adjust to but it was pretty easy overall. I made plenty of new friends with which I now hang out with everyday. I’ve slipped into life here like you slip into bed every night. What I do is fun and feels like normal.  I have now been living here for four years. I have been exchanging letters, emails, events, and memories with friends down in @LOCATION4 and friends here all this time. But even so, I long to go back down for a visit. I have been patiently waiting for it to happen. Now, I think that patience is paying off, because I finally get to visit this year.

18978	7	"I walked into the big open room. The smell of crayon, animal crackers and dirt overcome the air and hit my nose like a big wave rolling in from the sea. I take my first nervous steps into the room. The floor is covered with toys and a lot of crayons. The kindergartengs are running around screaming like little animals that hear d they were about to be eaten for dinner. The teacher is standing right in the middle of it all. She has a distant look in her eyes and she looks like she’s about to cry. When she sees me and my name tag her face lights up a little bit. She practicly runs at me with arms open. The teacher introduces herself then says they’re all mine. I never would have realized student teaching would have me doing so much teaching. I knew I’d do a little but as the teacher introduced herself, then said she was leaving and I had to teach them the alphabet. So I was stuck with @NUM1 kids and a “war.” I eventually, with some grabbing and pulling involved, get the kids to sit down criss-cross apple sauce on the floor. It’s too bad I underestimated how wild they were. As I begin, one of kids starts throwing toys at me, so as calmly as possible I half growled,” @CAPS1 @PERSON1, that’s not nice, please stop.” @CAPS2 stops for about @NUM2 way too short seconds. So this repeats and I end up doing this with all the wild eyed, crazy haired dwarfs.Iit took a lot of stinking patience to get them to finally sit still. We got to about @CAPS3 when the kinds got fussy again. At that point I was feeling more like a babysitter than a teacher. I was gradually understanding how that teacher was willing to leave. Finally I get that light bulb going off in my head feeling I run to my purse grab my bag of candy and say, “when we finish learning the alphabet A-@CAPS4, anyone who can say the whole thing will get a piece of candy!:” I realized tothem that’s like gold to an adult. I was amazed and couldn’t believe my ears. Every kid learned A-@CAPS4, I actually ran out of candy, although it took a lot of patience and pointless bicking. When the bell rings I hastily leave to go home. It took a lot of patience but I did it, and reward myself. I slept!"	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

I had to get two @DATE1 jobs so that can help me make the money that I lost . so two weeks past by then I went to the game store so I can buy the game. When I walked In the store, the manager told me there are no more copy’s of any basketball games. So I had to be patient for a whole nother @NUM2 weeks, and I get very mad. So I wated @NUM2 weeks for the game and I finaly got the game. I was so mad I had to be  patient that long but I got what it was wroth. So that is my story about being patient."	8	10		18				2	2	2	2			2	3	2	3								
19003	7	"This year I tried out for the @NUM1  grade volleyball team for my school. There were so many girls trying out that I was nervous for what team I was going to get on or if I even would make a team. So I worked  my hardest and figured, I had had experience from the other teams I was on before and I was now confident I would make the team. After @NUM2 of tryouts they had grouped us into either The A, @CAPS1 or intermural team, according to your skill level. We got a letter that afternoon, and I made it into the A team! We then got right into practice and games. Winning most of the games, and improving on working as a team. Then a couple days ago, we played against @ORGANIZATION1 middle school. As northern middle school, w obviously were rivals and were determined to beat them. For “bragging rigts,”we joked, but most important because we really wanted to do our best. The first game was very close, but we won, and I played about half the time, surviving, hitting and moving all around the court. I   felt very confident, in the second game also, even though I didn’t play as much as I wished. I still had fun! In the game of volleyball, you play @CAPS2 games in a match. The best two out of @CAPS2 wins the match. At that time we had won both of the games, which ment we won, however we still had to play the third game. Even though we won the match our coach wanted us to win all @CAPS2! Pretend like it’s the winning point, and play your hardest, she would say. So as the third game started, I was on the bench with some of the other players. I waited till about half of the game and wondered when I would be in. Time had gone by and I was getting discoureged because I hadn’t played yet. I asked the coach a couple of times if I was going in or not, but she was too busy watching and coaching. So I sat, and about I point before the game ended, she looked at me and said, ”can you do it?”I shot right up and subbed in. I whent to the back of the line, tossed the ball in the air, and hit it! i had made the winning point! In the end I learned to trust my coach and to have patience, because it usually is for the best! But boy did I have a great time serving the winning point. It really tought me a lesson!"	10	12		22				3	2	3	2			3	3	3	3								
19008	7	Patience is when you wait for something with out complaining. A time I was patient is when I was @NUM1 years old. It was about @NUM2 that day but the winds were picking up just a little. I was being patient si icould go into a ride in @LOCATION1 adventures. It was shimbering timbers. The line was very and when I mean very I mean long. It took me about a half of hour to get on ride. Another ride I waited for was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. But that one was shorter. It only took about @NUM3 minutes. All these  rides have to show patiene because if I didn’t show patience I wouldn’t be riding the good rides. The last one is when I was @NUM4. I wanted to ride the thunder hawk and the line took like for a whole hour. I played my nintendo as while I was waiting so it could be patient. An hour later I got to ride that ride all because of patience.	6	6		12				1	1	2	2			1	1	2	2

19061	7	"This is a story about patience. Patience is needed in life. Sometimes when you get very frustrated, you need patience. One reason is if someone or something   get’s you mad, you need patience or you can get in trouble. For example if you get mad because of someone and you start a fight, you’ll get in huge trouble. Or if you try doing something and you can’t, you need patience or you can break something and get in trouble. Another reason for patience is if you are working with someone or teaching someone, you need patience so you don’t hurt their feelings if they can’t do something right. They might get mad and not want to be with you. A third reason for patience is if you know someone who keeps getting you mad or keeps humiliating you, you need to have patience with him/her. Just ignore the person so you both don’t get in trouble. If you wouldn’t have patience, things could end drastically.so that is why you should have patience. Without patience you can get in trouble, lose a friend, and a lot of other things could go wrong. That’s why you need patience."	8	7		15				0	2	3	3			0	2	2	3

My gymnastics’ coach has been very patient with me, he has been working with me for about a month, on this one trick. I wanted to make him proud, he is like a brother to me. His name is @LOCATION1, I have known him since third grade. Whenever he see’s me he says “my baby!” and gives me a hug and kiss on the forehead. @PERSON1 can do many amazing things, he has competed many times. He taught me my back handspring, the first trick I had. His patience helps me, but sometimes it doesn’t. I am happy he is patient but sometimes he is too patient. Sometimes I would rather have him push me harder. Whenever I think he gets disappointed in me, I feel really bad. I always give it my all when I feel like that. It is an amazing feeling when you get it for him. “@CAPS1” I feel on my but, again. Instead of the normal, enthusiastic “try again”, it was flat and bored. I went to the edge of the floor. My adrenaline was pulsing. I was going to get this! As I ran and jumped everything was good. I did the trick, and landed! For about a second anyway. My feet slipped and from under me, @PERSON1 came running to me smiling. He was proud of me, even though I didn’t stick it. We kept working and eventually I got it! I was really happy to tell my cheer coach, but even happier that I did it for @PERSON1."	10	12		22				2	3	2	3			3	3	3	3

Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant.  Also it means you experience difficulties without complaining.

My dad had told me that you needed turn the handlebars before you crashed, but I kept forgetting and falling down. Devestated that @CAPS1 wasn’t easy, I gave up a little bit after. Now, though, my mom gently persuaded me to try again. Holding on to the bike, she told me to pedal. She let go, and yelled, “turn! Turn!” but @CAPS1 was no use. I turned the wrong way and toppled over on the grass. “@CAPS1’s okay. You almost had @CAPS1!” mom said rushing over to me. Putting on a brave face, I tried again.

When I got back, we both did little dances, my mom congratulated me, and we called my dad to brag about my new accomplishment. To me, my mom showed patience that day.

My best friend @PERSON1 and I had been talking on the phone everyday for at least an hour each day for about two weeks straight. Finally, @PERSON1 asked me over. And if I wanted to go to @LOCATION1’s @CAPS1 the next @DATE1! Of course. I said yes, and soon enough, it was planned that I would spend the @TIME2 on @DATE2 and leave @DATE1 for @CAPS3 with her. The next few days were a bore, just sitting at home and babysitting my brothers. It seemed a millennium later that @DATE3 @TIME1 came. @PERSON1 called and said that I probably wouldn’t be able to spend the @TIME2, but we were still planned to leave for @CAPS3 at @NUM1:ooam on @DATE1.

We tried running around the house a few times, but that only took about ten minutes. We then decided it was time for a movie. We watched @CAPS5 to burn at least two hours of spare time. We had lunch and after that, things went by super quick to make up for how slow it had been passing. I talked to kenzie for at least two hours, and then my parents came home and everything went about as usual. Next it was time for bed. I tossed and turned in my sheets, but couldn’t get to sleep. Kenzie ended up calling me at @NUM2 just to tell me that she was eating a piece of pizza, which didn’t help at all. Finally, I fell into a deep that was needed. The next morning, I got dressed, packed my bags and was ready to go. Kenzie, her mom and her brothers arrived and we were finally off to a sweet @DATE4 day of @LOCATION1’s @CAPS1. The ride there seemed five minutes long, but that was a good thing.  We were there! We went on tons of sweet rides and got @CAPS7 @CAPS8 for dessert. I was both patient and impatient at parts.

19139	7	"Patient is very important if there were no patience everyone would be irritated all the time. if there were no patience we wouldn`t be able to get through the day we would be constantly looking at the clock thinking when am I going to get out. Some people have no patience and others havetons. That could affect how everyone acts toward each other no patience could affect the littlest things we are all fighting because we had to wait in line at a store, or have to count money. It could change the life style of everyone on the planet patience is one of the most important things on the planet. Patiences helps us make the right choice. Instead of someone asking you a question and you answering right away you wait and make the better decision. Although many of us think, on patience I can summarize that right now it is more than waiting it`s being acceptive of something you don`t like. It`s also going threw life without saying why can`t I do what or you can`t because I can`t. The world wouldn`t be the way it is without patience."	5	6		11				0	1	2	2			0	1	2	3

Every day I would come home sit down at the table and take my time, and doing work. @NUM1 problems a day was hard for a fourth grader. Whenever math started I would get out my homework and wait to check it. I never did terrible. @CAPS2 I was always proud of my work. But when it came to getting my homework assignment, I was never happy. A new lesson every day was also challenging. I had to be patient and take my time. I had to be patient and take my time. One day my teacher gave us as easy lesson and I felt confident I could finish it at school. I came to a hard problem every once in a wile and I would stress out. But I remembered what my mom said, “be patient and stay calm,” @CAPS2 I did. I was patient and I worked through the problem. Now to this day I remember to be patient. I also remember what we will have to live with being patient all our lives. Math is what helped me become a more patient person inside and out."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

There isn’t a book your assigned to read called  patience @NUM1,there is no movie called patience is the key. Non of that exists, even if you live in a world where a necklace can be turned into a camera, or a cell phone is a gun. I have just been assigned my first undercover mission and it’s not at all wat  i had expected. So far, all I have done is sat on a cold bench next to  the strength meter at a county fair. What people really don’t understand is the patience that is put in to being a spy. Sure theres an ocasional car being blown up bet  not today, not for me. I here the clock in my hand so ‘tick,tock,tick,tock’. @CAPS3  @CAPS2, there’s come action. The subject (the person I’m assigned to watch is on the move and, oh, nevermind, all the subject has done is bay a three dollar bag of popcorn. I start to doodlle a design in the dirt, with my foot. I’m just about to abort the mission. Seeing that nothing is happening when all of a sudden I find a clue. There in the dirt that lay just before me. I see a tiny computer chip. I pick it up and spray it with finger print revealing mist. A purple fluffy cloud of vapor sorround the chip. Sure enough when the purple cloud vanishes. I see that the subjects fingerprints are on the chip, I pull out my laptop at insert the computer chip. @CAPS1 @CAPS1 are the words that stay on the computer screen as if refusing to leave. I sit there waiting bored. I remember patience. I think to myself that if I’m able to defeat twelve armed robers with nothing but a tablecloth, I’m sure I can sit here and just be patient.  At least twenty minutes have gone by now but i feels like twenty hours. The computer still has written on the screen, @CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 wassucsessful. “@CAPS2!” I say aloud and people start to stare, but I dont mind. I click the square on the screen that says “open.” @CAPS3 a small message opens up that says “@CAPS4 me at the ice cream pallor.” I close my laptop and start to slowly walk over to the ice cream van, observing everyone , and everything around me. A man wearing a yellow shirt and a lady with a purple scarf diaped over her head are the only two people standing by the icecream stand. I walk a little bit closer and i realise that the man has a gun. I pull out mine and with a few loud roars they were both in handcaffs ofcoure, they were both working with the main suspect.

19412	7	Patience is when your understanding and tolerant. Also a person that experiences difficulties without complaining. A time when I was patient was when my baby sister was born. I was patient then because I had to wait until she was born and then I could become a big sister. My little sister was supposed to be born on @DATE1 twenty second. That day my mom wasn’t even breaking a sweat. I thought she would be ready to go and get her bags(which she packed the night before) and ready to have the baby. I most certainly was. One week and two days later my mom went into labor and was ready to have my little sister. I was patient for those nine days of waiting. I waited patiently in the waiting room with my dad and big brother until the nurse came out and said we could come inside of the room. When I saw my baby sisters’ face I almost started to cry. I knew I was going to love her and she was going to be just as patient as I was.	11	9		20				3	3	2	3			2	2	2	3

We waited for another hour or two but it never stoped. We forgot about my mom and brothers so we left. I was patient the whole time. We went and got in line for one of the new rides they just got and since it new the line was long. We waited for quit a while.

And every time my patience would grow to the size of a drop of water, the spider monkey in my head would be trying to find a way out so they could knock the idiot out.

It was just the older girls going, because we new if we took the little people we couldn’t go into the haunted houses, although we went inside one. It was so fun until we got to the lines. They were rediculasly long. I mean it literaly took us about an hour in a half to get on the rollercoaster. My cousins and I were talking for a long time. We were in the back of the whole part, called “The dead zone”, it was very terrifying but fun all at the same time. What a weird feeling. We finally got inside of the place and we still had a long way to go, stairs to climb, bars to pass, it was terrible. But did we complain, not me. I was patient unlike my cousins. We finally got to the top floor and can you belive it, we still had to wait. Then my cousins turned on some music to keep us occupied, but not for long. Then we looked over and realized how far up we were, and started to talk about how scary it would be to fell. Then we went on and on talking. But soon after that we had the people say “were going to hold of for a minute to check and make sure that the @CAPS2 coaster doesn’t have any mechanical problems.” That’s when my cousins went off. We tried to get her to calm down. So we all just sat down a waited. Finally the line was moving forward once more. Then we reached the top of the rollercoaster @CAPS3. We finally could see the @CAPS2 coaster, I guess at that point it looked like time flew by, mabey because we were excited. We finally were on the ride, one of the funest rides in the whole park called “The mauerie”. I guess the wait was worth it. The ride went about @NUM3 per hr, it was jerky, there were drops, it was fun.

19470	7	"There are two reasons why I think patience is important. The first is because if you are not patient, than you can end up distracting other people around you. For example, if you finished your @CAPS1 test early and you kept telling everyone else to burry up it’s distracting. Now that you’ve interrupted everyone, they have lost their train of thought and now they @MONTH1 have to start over. A few weeks ago, my sister and I were out walking my dog and pulled so hard my little sister fell over and my dog ran away. We had to be patient and wait for him to return.  My sister kept wanting to go call my mom to tell her the dog ran away again but I told her it would be rude to call because it would distract her from her work. Another reason why patience is important is because if you are not patient can get hurt. Let’s say you were going down the stairs and your sibling was in front of you and you needed to get downstairs quickly but they were walking down the stairs very slow, so you pushed them, they could get very hurt. In conclusion, patience is needed always and cannot be forgotten"	9	6		15				2	2	2	3			1	1	2	2

Okay so it was @NUM1 last year yar @DATE1 I think. My mom and I were left for a doctor’s appointment. So we left around @NUM2 after school started. So when we got there I was just waiting for like @NUM3 hours bored out of my mind. I didn’t know what to do so I saw the fish @CAPS3 I was watching them for about @NUM4, doing nothing then finally the women of the counter desk said , “@PERSON1 then I knew it was our turn. So we went in the room I layed on the bed. I went to sleep on accident, but while I was sleeping they gave me a painful shot it hurt so bad. Then I woke up and that was the time “when I was paitient.”"	7	7		14				2	2	1	2			2	1	2	2								
19499	7	"We all have our times when we are very patient, and the times when we lose all patience we have. Well , yesterday, I was very patient my sister, @PERSON2 throws tons of fits and she is very bratty. I don’t know what it is that ticks her off so much. She gets very mean and violent. Here’s the story. We were walking home yesterday. Everything was going fine. When we got home mom told us we had to clean. Well our room was clean, and I wouldn’t let @PERSON2 go up to clean”  it. She screamed at the top of her lungs and cried. @MONTH1 I remind you, she’s ten. She stormed up the stairs and she was on the phone with her. “friend” @PERSON1. I told her to hang up because we had to clean. Yet zazin she screamed. So our sister, @ORGANIZATION1 got @NUM1 said to knock it off, hang up the phone, and clean. Then @PERSON2 made us listen to @PERSON1’s  text messages. I’ll admit @PERSON1 wasn’t being very nice. So we told @PERSON2 to not answer the phone. We weren’t yelling, we were being very calm and patient. She was still screaming so we just left her alone to scream. Then, our mom came home. @PERSON3 and I told our mom what had happened. Then our mom told @PERSON2 she is grounded, no longer allowed to talk, text, or even talk to @PERSON1 at school. My mom also thanked @PERSON3 and I for being so patient. So that is my story about how I was patient. I’m not the most patient person, but I have my times, and so should everyone else. Life is so much better in the long run if you are patient!"	9	12		21				2	2	2	3			3	3	3	3

After he got online we played most of day then I got off and watched @CAPS3 because I was bored. Nothing was on so I got on the computer, still bored. So I tried to take a nap, didn’t work. After that I tried to play my xbox but after another hour (nowaround @TIME1) it got bored. I still played for about another half an hour till I just redid my account while listening to music and played some more till he got online.

The night before we left was probably the hardest. I was so excited I couldn’t sleep at all. The day we left I was so excited and I was running all around the house yelling.  Finally we loaded up the car and left for @LOCATION1. We drove our car there so it took almost @NUM1 days. But it was worth it, @LOCATION1 was really fun and pretty.

We were lost in @LOCATION1 for almost a hour going up and down looking for our cusion that were coming too. I had to search but there was no space to. I wanted to go outside and run, jump but I hade to be patient. It was @NUM1 in the morning and I was tird. We still had to look for our hotel which was taking for ever!

14841	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, many complications occurred during the plans and construction of the attempted docking mast. One obstacle was that dirigibles were just too heavy and the metal frame of the building would have to be modified. After repairing the framework of the Empire State Building, two trial runs were displayed by the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear blimp ""Columbia"". The result of the expirament were that the wind current, physically, didn't allow the blimp to come close enough to the building to dock Also, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban cities"" was an obstacle they could not surpass. Within years of postponing their efforts, airplanes made way and dirigibles, as transportation, were long forgotten."	3	3		3

A mooring mast added to the top of the building would dirigible's to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on, the electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and get passengers could safely get on and off The dirigible by walking down a gang @CAPS1 to an open observation platform. They of the Empire state Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations of the U.S. Naval Air station in Lakehurst, New Jersey."	2	1		2																					
14852	6	"The first obstacle that it faced with having to reconstruct the body frame so that it could support the mooring mast, The second is that dirigibles from other country's used hydrogen, wich is highly flammable, instead of helium. The third reason wich should have been apparent from the start was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The last reason is the wind conditions at that hight made it impossible for the dirigibles to land there without the tail and swaying in the wind."	3	2		3																					
14857	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced difficult circumstances and many obstacles during the task of designing a brand new Empire State Building to accompany this new means of travel. The builder's mission was to design the top of the Empire State Building to accommodate the mooring of blimps over one thousand feet in the air. The first obstacle was designing a landing area. This was difficult because the architecture needed had never before been created or even attempted in the past. A second obstacle was having to make sure the Empire State Building could withstand the stress created by the blimp. Paragraph @NUM1 says ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The difficulty with this obstacle was having to refurbish the steel frame at the Empire State Building which took lots of time, work, and over sixty thousand dollars. ""The greatest obstacles to successful mooring was nature itself."" There were violent wind currents at the top of the building and the blimps were never very stable. There were many pedestrians under a moored dirigible so this was a very dangerous obstacle. Lastly, the pre existing laws of airships flying the low over urban areas posed a new problem. even with successful architecture, laws disallowed the blimps in the first place! Planes were also becoming more popular."	4	4		4																					
14862	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there was many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced with allowing diriibles to land there. One of the obstacles were the safety problems. The drigibles had to come close enough to the Empire State building so they could be able to tie the dirible down. This put the diribles too close to the people. There was a law that that stated that airships can't fly to low to urban areas. There was a disaster that happened in Lakehurst, New Jersey that they were trying to prevent from happening in New York (paragraph @NUM1). Another problem with that builders faced was that the strong winds of nature did not allow diribles to get close enough to tie down to the mast. There were many obstacles builders had to face that at the end it was not worth making the Empire state building a dirible dock."	3	3		3																					
14863	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The steel frame of the Building needed to be modified and strengthened to make a place for dirigibles to dock. Also, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made. The last obstacle builders had was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame. It was not easy for builders to build a mooring mast on top of the highest building that was one thousand two hundred fifty feet, but the architects reached their point by designing the mooring mast."	2	3		3																					
14865	6	"There were many reasons why architects had problems allowing dirigibles to dock on the empire State building. One of the problems was that most dirigibles were @NUM1 ft long and it would be to much. There Would only be a single cable tether and it would add stress to the buildings frame. The entire Steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened which would cost over sixty thousand dollars.The greatest reason why the mooring mast would never fullfill its purpose is safety. Most dirigibles from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The greatest obsticale to the successful use of the mooring was nature itself. The winds on the top of the buildings were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back of the Ship would swivel around. They are meant to land on open playing feilds but using these at the empire state building Where they would be dangling high above pedestrians was not safe"	3	3		3																					
14867	6	There were many obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One obstacle was the wind. At higher elevation the wind is much more powerful. This would make it very difficult to accually get the dirigible close to the mast. Also the structure of of Empire State Building. The framework was not built for the amount of weight that would be on top of the building. Builders made over @MONEY1 worth of fortifying the framework. Those are some obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																					
14870	6	"In the excerpt, the Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the construction of the Empire State Building faces many problems. One of these problems is that the governer of New York, Al Smith wanted the building to be the tallest in the world. In order to do this you would need a mask to break the record. The mask made to made nature a danger to the whole building because of violent air current. Another reason how the Empire State Building failed is because their was a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. This law went in effect because of a German dirigible caught on fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Those were just some of the many problems the dirigibles faced while passing the Empire State Building."	2	2		2																					
14872	6	"Although Al Smith had expected the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to be unique and practical, builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, in order for the building to accommodate the stress that the dirigibles would add to the building's frame, the framework of the building had to be modified. This cost over sixty thousand dollars. In addition, dirigibles used hydrogen-a highly flammable gas. An accident could be fatal in a densely-populated area like New York City. Also, there were violent winds at the top of the building that would making docking difficult and could possibly blow a dirigible into the side of the building, causing it to be punctured. Finally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying to low over urban areas; it would be illegal for a ship even to approach the building's area."	3	3		3																					
14876	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are described. One obstacle was that most dirigibles were highly flammable. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible caught on fire near the Empire State Building, the accident would affect many people since its a densely populated area. Another obstacle the builders faced was the winds of nature itself. Even if a dirigible was docked, it would still swivel around too much. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""... they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" One more obstacle they faced was an existing law. In paragraph @NUM3 it says, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The architects faced many obstacles while trying to bring their idea to reality. It's better to plan ahead and think of every obstacle before bringing ideas to life."	3	3		3																					
14880	6	"In the excerpt from, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, tells about the original purpose to the mast on top of the Empire State Building was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles (blimps).Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the tremendous stress that the mast would put on the Empire State Building. In order to get around this, they put frame work around the entire building's frame. Another obstacle that was faced was safety. First of all, the wind at the top of the Empire State Building was to great for any blimp to stay aloft in mid-air without being tossed around. Finally, the possibility of the blimp either popping on the spikes, or blowing up because of the hydrogen, over New York City.In conclusion, the mast on the Empire State Building, looked good on paper, but once you add in natural elements, the mast had too many flaw to it."	2	3		3																					
14886	6	"Some of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly weather and safety. In paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This means that because of the wind and air currents always shifting the the dirigibles would be hard to control. Another obstacle they faced was safety. Also in paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights... where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street..."" @CAPS1 that means is having something heavy dangling above people is not a good idea. It wouldn't be a good idea because if the weight would of disconnected from the dirigibles there is a possibility that somebody could get injured badly. Those obstacles are @CAPS1 builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock."	3	2		3																					
14891	6	"When they build the Empire State Building they faced obstacles building it. An obstacle they faced was that they wanted to make it as high and as safe as possible. The way the architetures wanted to make it the tallest building in the world was by putting a mooring mast on the top of the building. A mooring mast is basically a dock for dirigibles (blimps). This was dangerous. It was because the Mast could snap at such a high altitude and plumate to the ground or snap, and dangle high above the street. ""... The Government people in washington are figuring on some way of mooring airships to this mast,"" says Al Smith four year term governor of New York. Although it may look nice, its not the safest idea."	1	1		1																					
14895	6	"In the short story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 There is an obsticle that the builders had to over come. Building the top of the empire state building was difficult because the dock part of the tower wasn't stable. Also the frame of the building couldn't support the dirigible, ""dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"". The designers designed a new tower that was a ""shinny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside"". The winches and controlling machinery would be housed in the base of the shaft its self. They also added a observation deck and more passengers were able to wait for the dirigible. another problem with it was there was a law that aircrafts couldn't get to close to urban places. Over all it was a hard pain saking design for them and costed alot of money."	2	2		2																					
14900	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the greatest being safety. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, most dirigibles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable. Also another issue was purposed in paragraph @NUM2, this was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered down, the back of of the ship would swivel around the morning mass. Yet another obstacle as to the reason why dirigibles couldn't dock at the Empire State Building was in paragraph @NUM3, this was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These obstacles made it nearly impossible for the Empire State Building to serve it's original purpose."	3	3		3																					
14902	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building had to face while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason is the dirigibles were unsafe. This is because dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. If the dirigible caught on fire in a densely populated place, then many people could die from it. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. This is because the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting so the back of the dirigible would swivel back and forth. They could only fix the problem by putting weights on the back of the ship, but to do that impractical and unsafe. This is because the weights are dangling high above pedestrians, so if one broke, it could kill someone. The third obstacle is that there was a law against airships flying to low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for the ships tie up to the building. The final obstacle was the wind could have pushed the ship onto sharp spires, which could puncture the ship, so the pilots wouldn't be able to get the mooring equipment. These are the obstacles the builders face, which caused the mooring equipment not to be installed."	4	3		4																					
14903	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety reasons, weather conditions, and government laws, defeated the purpose of the mooring mast on top of the building. For example, many of the dirigibles used at the time contained hydrogen instead of helium, ""hydrogen is highly flammable... above a densely populated area."" (@NUM1). The builders realized this was not smart. Furthermore, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents."" (@NUM2) This created a dangerous situation because the ship would swing around the mast. Lastly, the most obvious obstacle was a government law prohibiting a ship to even approach the building. ""...an existing law against airships flyinging too low over urban areas"" .(@NUM3) The whole idea that was built up to something great had slowly dwindled. The builders of the Empire State Building faced these obstacles, and many more, in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
14904	6	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, many obstacles of building the Empire State building as a docking station for dirigibles are describle. John Tauranac, the man who came up with the plan to dock dirigibles on the top of the empire state building forgot some very important things to take into account. First the entire building would have to be modified because ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stres to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The second problem that would need to be solved would be the safety of the city. Many ""dirigibles from outside United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM2.). If an accident like German dirigible Hindenburg happened, it would be ten times worse. Lastly, the ""violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM3) would pose as one of the greatest obstacles. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to tie up but could not get close enough because of ""forceful wind."" (paragraph @NUM4). The obstacles of making the empire state building into a mooring mast caused too many obstacles that could not be solved."	3	3		3																					
14905	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of a building had never been done before. They had to add over sixty thousand dollars worth of framework before they could even begin building the mast. Then, once the mast was designed, and the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the mast could begin to be framed."	1	1		1																					
14926	6	"Through the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, we learned that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the summit of the building. Some of the obstacles that the builders faced in this enginering challenge are; @CAPS1 the builders faced the challenge of how the Empire State Building was going to be able to support the weight of these long aircrafts. We learned this in paragraph @NUM1 when the author states ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the buildings frame."" To overcome this problem ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened (@NUM2)."" It is later said that these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem that the builders faced was, how safe docking a blimp would be in a highly populated area.  In paragraph @NUM3 we learned that most dirigibles are made of hydrogen, which is highly flammable. After ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey... The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" All in all in the excerpt The Mooring Mast will learned that the builders of the Empire State Building face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the peak of the building."	3	3		3																					
14927	6	"The builders of the empire state building could not dock dirigibles because of the building's structure, the winds pushing the dirigibles, and public safety. The structure could not handle the swaying dirigible becacse of the winds pushing the back side. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. this quote shows how dangerous it would be to put a large flammable dirigible over new york and the people in new york."	2	2		2																					
14929	6	"Most of the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building had were due to weather. If New York ever had a windy day the dirigible would pull at the mast. The mast is attached to the ""@CAPS1"" of the building, and it might affect the frames or ""@CAPS1"" of the building. Another reason is the danger it would bring to all of New York. If a dirigible ever hit something or something went wrong the dirigible would @CAPS3 on top of New York.

14940	6	"Although the idea for turning the mast at the top of the Empire State building into a docking area for dirigibles was a highly clever idea, it was not a very safe one at all. One ""reason why dirigibles could not moor the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law left the idea of the mast as a failure before construction even began, but the workers failed to notice this law. Another obstacle that added difficulty to the construction was how much pressure having the dirigibles moored to the building added to the base of the building. This caused another @MONEY1 to be spent trying to fix this problem. A third factor that made the idea of setting up a mast even more difficult came straight from nature itself. The winds that high off the ground made manuvering the dirigible in such a small space very difficult. This was proven when ""In December 1930, the U.S Navy Dirigible' Los Angeles' approach the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."	3	3		3																					
14946	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring at the top of the building. The main challenge was caused by nature itself. The winds above the building were constantly blowing and shifting direction. This would cause any dirigible attempting to dock swing around and below in the wind, which poses many safty risks for passengers going on and off the zepplen. The dirigible could also puncture its frame on nearby buildings while attempting to dock, which also causes safty risks for people on the building and on the ground. Have a zepplen attatched to the building also made it structurally unstable and modifications had to be made the frame of the building to give it more support. In the end, the idea was dropped because it would never work and was unrealistic."	3	2		3																					
14947	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced while trying to dock dirigibles. One obstacle was nature. At the top of the building, the winds constantly changing because violent air currents. This would make a ship swivel around dangerously. Even if it was tied in the back would move. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of ship with swivel."" Another obstacle was safety. Foreign ships use hydrogen, and extremely flammable gas. In fields, they use lead weights to weight down. If an accident happened with either it would be extremely fatal. A flaming dirigible or a falling metal object  at extreme heights would cause serious injuries because the landing is above a highly populated city. ""Dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen... is highly flammable."" ""Could be weighted down by lead weights, but using these at the Empire State building, where they would be hanging high above pedestrians on the street."" A law forbids ships to fly in low urban areas so, if the moore worked it couldn't be used. These events led to the quiet dissaperance of the thought in the late 1930's."	3	3		3																					
14948	6	"Throughout the passage, the builders were faced with many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. Al Smith had the idea to have dirigibles be a new form of transportation. The idea sounded great with the dirigibles moving at a rate of seventy five miles per hour and moving thousands of feet without needing to be refuled. Anxious, Al smith was very unsure of when the would all be done, saying, ""it's on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now."" It would just not be possible for the architect to drop the huge mooring mass on top of the buildings flat roof. Another problem would be the violent wind currents. The fate of the dirigible had faded out. Airplanes became more suitable to passengers then dirigibles."	1	2		2																					
14950	6	"There were several obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was they would have to change & fix the @CAPS1 of the Building in order to compensate for all the Stress there would be on the Building when the dirigibles landed. After they constructed & built the landing, there were several more problems. The first problem was that the hydrogen in the balloons is very flammable. This is a problem because New York is densely populated & with a flammable substance above there heads, it poses a threat. The second problem was the dirigible itself. It can easily blow in the wind, & would constantly wave in the wind, & unlike in a field, weights cold not be tied to the back of it because of the crowds below. The third & final problem they dealt with was the law: airships are not allowed too fly low over urban areas. The Empire State Building was too low in an urban area for anything to fly over it. Several of these problems led to the failure of the original idea & left the Empire State Building with a tall post of no purpose."	3	3		3																					
14952	6	"Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, was that it wouldnt be able to tie cable tether, because it adds stress to the buildings frame.

14956	6	"Although high expectations were concieved for the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as explained in the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1. The dream of having a mooring mast to dock new airships was quickly halted when architects first discovered the stress that a dirigible, held by a single cable tether, would add to the building's fame. As a result, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would...be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation...nearly eleven hundred feet below"" (paragraph @NUM1). Consequently, architects had to reinforce the buildings framework to accommodate the tremendous amounts of stress. Secondly, the owners of the Empire State Building found that a law concerning airships became an obstacle as well. Stating that airships could not fly too low over populated urban areas, the law became another practical reason why dirigibles could not moor atop the miraculous building. Finally, architects had also discovered the greatest obstacle to their success to be nature itself. The winds atop the building were described to be violent, forceful and unpredictable. As a result, mooring dirigibles to the mast ""where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"" (paragraph @NUM2). Moreover, the violent winds made it difficult for dirigibles to approach the mooring mast. In December 1930, the captain of the U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" feared that ""the wind would blow the dirigible into the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell"" (paragraph @NUM3). In effect, the idea of using the mooring mast to dock dirigibles atop the Empire State Building quietly disappeared. As described by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 in the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there."	4	4		4

14962	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, there is an obstacle the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. This idea would not work because the dirigibles is way to heavy, and that would cause more pessure towards the Empire state building. When there a massive amount of pressure on the building, it would collapse. ""The dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another obstacle is it was expensive to build it. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" In New York there are many places and people are tightly packed. There isn't any space that is big enough for the dock. ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York city."" These are the main obstacles of the Empire state building to allow dirigibles to dock."	2	2		2																					
14966	6	"In the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

In paragraph @NUM2, it states that ""if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around"", now thats niether practical nor safe. If the ship is tied, the back should be stable. The last obstacle that the builders faced was a law against airships flying too low. In paragraph @NUM3, it applies that ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Though some ships did attempt to reach the building, there was no success in that."	3	2		3																					
14981	6	"Al Smith, a former governor of New York had a brilliant idea to make the empire state building, the tallest building in the world.

But, this plan had many @NUM1, ""The stress of the dirigible's load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation"".  This is a problem because if the mast was just placed on the building, it would destroy itself.  Another problem is that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen.""  Hydrogen is a very flamable gas, and would put the whole section of the city underneath the Zeppelin at risk.  The third Reason was an existing law which prevented airships from flying too low in urban areas."	3	3		3																					
14987	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was attaching a mooring mast to the top of the building. Because of the height of the Empire State Building, they were unable to just drop the mast onto the roof for would have interfered with the buildings overall frame. In order to keep the mooring mast atop the roof, the architects spent thousands of dollars on modifying the framework of the building. Another obstacle for the docking of diribles was the preservation of the safety of the public below. Dirigibles were inflated with highly flammable hydrogen, creating the risk of a massive explosion over New York and endangering countless lives. Lastly, a very important obstacle for the builders was the danger of nature. Violent air currents filled the winds above and around the Empire State Building. Even if a dirigible were strung to the roof, the back of the ship would continue to swivel, causing even more danger to citizens below the building. Those were some obstacles that builders faced and prevented to making of a mooring mast to let dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."	4	3		4																					
14991	6	"During the Building of the Mast, the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The @CAPS1 obstacle was the building itself. By adding the mast lots of stress would be added to the buildings frame and therefore strengthening modifications had to take place before the mast was erected. Another problem was how to tether the Blimp properly since they are generally landed in wide open fields which allowed for wieghts to be place in the front and back of the blimp, they could be secured properly. But since the blimp was going to be attached to a mast, there was no way to secure the back of the blimp and therefore no safe way to tie the blimp down. And finally the last problem builders faced was the how to even get the blimp docked. Since there was such high winds on top of the building there was no feasible way to dock the blimp in less it was perfect weather. Ultimately all those problems made it so the mast could never be used."	3	3		3																					
14996	6	"The builders came across many obstacles while trying to build the Empire State building for dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was just having ""... a single cable tether."" which they went on to say it would add stress to the building so they had to fix that. They choose to modify the frame and strengthen it as well. Another obstacle was having to get the right equipment. They had to go get some information from the @ORGANIZATION2 air station. The last obstacle would be the dirigibles were filled with oxygen instead of Helium. This had meant it was very flammable which was something the must consider. While trying to make this work for the dirigibles they came across building problems, safety, and dangerous problems."	2	2		2																					
15002	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there were many and at the end the dock could not happen.

Being so high the dock would be moved around because of the winds. Also the blimp itself could not even attached itself to the dock because the winds wouldn't let it.

15007	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. So Al Smith thought putting a mooring mast at the top of the building, would allow dirigibles to dock there several hours. It would allow the dirigibles to refuel or get serviced and let passengers on and off. Another obstacle would be how the dirigible would be moored. It would be held by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the frame of the building. The stress of the load and wind pressure would have to be transferred all the way to the foundation of the building, which was about eleven hundred feet below. Third obstacle would be using hydrogen or helium. If they used hydrogen it is highly flammable, and the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. Those are some of the obstacles the builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	3		3																					
15013	6	In the excerpt the builders had wanted dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. They found that they couldn't do that because the winds would push the dirigibles in all different dirrections.

15018	6	"It was unrealistic and also unsafe of engineers to think that they could have dirigibles dock on the building. One major problem with the idea that the dirigible would add stress to the building's frame. Also the weight of the dirigible and the wind pressure would cause a problem for the foundation. Another thing, dirigibles were made up of hydrogen which is highly flammable, and if one of the exploded it would have been a disaster for downtown New York.

15027	6	"One of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that the construction of the mooring mast would add stress to the building due to its height. The architects, however, were able to design a special type of stainless steel that would be illuminated from the inside and provide support. Another obstacle was that the dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and having such an airship with flammable gas nearby civilization was considered unreasonable. Thus, a law was passed that forbid the transportation of dirigibles close to the public. Nature was also against the architects, and so posed a safety hazard when high-speed winds attempted to @CAPS1 the dirigibles from the sky while being weighed down with lead weights. In the end, the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was never used due to these issues."	3	3		3																					
15031	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there The higher calling for which the mooring mast was built was to put New York on the forefront of modern travel; the builders then, needed to solve some obstacles that were on their way.

According to the excerpt, @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the building's framework. Another problem was that of the stress of the wind pressure The wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. This was also solved, at least they thought, by making a few changes to the skeleton of the building. Lastly, was that the building needed a space to provide for passengers that were to come from the ""blimps"".

This showed the builders and owners of the Empire State Building that it was very dangerous for dirigibles trying to dock there. A main set of problems the builders faced was making the building itself strong enough to allow dirigibles to dock.

What they didn't seem to realize was just how many problems and obstacles there were to get in the way of the mast's success. One minor set back was that the mast (and the blimp attached to it) would add great amounts of stress to the frame of the building. This problem was taken care of with little stress by simply modifying in strengthening the building's foundation and frame. The largest obstacle standing in the way of the mast's success was the heavy winds at the top of the building, which were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"".

Also, the added stress of a dirigible moored on the Empire State Building could have easily cracked or collapsed the building and its foundation.

15105	6	"In the 1930's the world was evolveing and new technology's were comeing of age. One of these tecnology's was the Dirigible and some people thougt to expand it's use. One of these idea's was the moring mast on the Empire State building. This was a great idea but the things that stood in it's way made it impossible. A major problem was the safty, consdiring it was 1,250 feet up. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If this thing caught on fire, everyone inside would burn to death or crass into the ground and kill everyone under it. Another huge problem was the winds and ease of pushing it off corse. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These winds made it simply impossible for this to happen. One problem that should have bee looked at from the beging was law. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airship's flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1 this moring Mast was a fantastic idea, there were to many things standing in it's way."	3	3		3																					
15106	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, describes complicated obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles was competition. ""It was planned as the world's tallest building taller even than the new Chrysler Building,"" (@CAPS1 1). ""Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of world's tallest building"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). There was a competition as to had the tallest building between the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Another obstacle, was the safety and dirigibles. ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurts, New Jersey, The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populate area such as down town New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The owner didn't want to risk a accident to cost people's life it would have been bad rep for them. The obstacles that the builders went through was a positive thing, it made them @CAPS2 and open their eyes."	1	1		1																					
15107	6	"There are many obstacles faced because of letting the dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. First, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This means that the winds ontop of the building were strong and will cause the dirigible will swivel around the mooring mast, if tethered. Also, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the areas."" This shows that it was a waist of time thinking ships could moor at the State Building because there is a clear law against it. There still are many obstacles you have to over come for any project."	2	3		3																					
15110	6	"There are always challenges when you are trying something inovative. There are obstacles like getting approval, gaining support and you also need to be structurally sound. Al Smith and the rest of these archetects faced all of these. During the 1920s dirigibles were supposed to be the future of travel. Al Smith wanted to be able to dock a dirigible on top of the Empire State building. Other than getting people to go along with the plan he had other problems. The wind is very violent at that altitude. Dirigibles were not supposed to fly that close to the city it is dangerous and some were highly flamable. In conclusion There were too many large obstacles to overcome."	2	2		2																					
15111	6	"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""Hydrogen is highly flammable."" The dirigibles ran on hydrogen verses helium and if it were to ever to catch on fire there would be pedestrians everywhere below that would be in grave danger. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Because the dirigible would be docked so high with little back control, the fierce winds would be a huge issue. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If a dirigible were to dock there it would also be breaking laws. ""...was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The builders a lot more obstacles dealing with the docking of dirigibles than just architectural."	3	3		3																					
15121	6	"Builders of the empire state building faced challenging obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock their ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself"" This was a huge problem for the mooring masts because they could not get close enough to the building to land. The winds were too strong. Secondly, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" meaning that because there were so many people in a small area of downtown New York it was too dangerous for dirigibles and other aircrafts to be that low. Lastly dirigibles from outside of the state used hydrogen rather then helium ""hydrogen is highly flameable"" After the German Hindenburg had an accident with fire it was clear that taking the risk of an accident like that happen above the heads of thousands of pedestrians was a bad idea. The obstacles, which were noticed too late; before the construction, is why the dirigables are not allowed to land on the Empire State building to this day."	3	4		4																					
15125	6	"The builders of the Empire state building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders had to be cautious about safety, which played a big role with the dirigibles. Many dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Because hydrogen is highly flammable they wouldn't want the city to be destroyed and at risk of a massive fire. Another problem was nature itself. There were violent air currents above the building and not be a danger to the local pedestrians of New York. The final obstacle builders faced when trying to pursue the dirigible idea was a law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. They would be breaking the law to even allow it within the area of the building, with so many issues occurring in the development of the dirigible plan, the idea of using them quietly disappeared."	3	3		3																					
15128	6	"Based on the excerpt, the workers faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 the architects say that ""they could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building."" The reason for this is because the top of the roof is held together by just one cable tether. The effect of landing something so heavy on the roof would add stress the the buildings frame. In order to allow the dirigibles there they would need to strengthen and modifi the buildings framework, this would cost at least over @MONEY1. Rather than doing that the architects designed a glass, chrome and stainless steel tower that was @CAPS1 from inside. This would ""rise a conical roof that would house the mooring arm."" -paragraph @NUM2. Elevators would also be inside to help the passengers board the dirigibles."	3	2		3																					
15130	6	"Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock was that the winds at that height were alway changing and difficult to land a dirigible with. Also the dirigible are highly flammable because the used hydrogen rather than helium. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The project was a bad idea from the start. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" They even attempt to try it before they gave up. ""In December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds.""  It just wasn't made do that job so it wouldn't work."	3	2		3																					
15146	6	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that there wasn't a lot of room for them to land. The length of them was the same as four blocks in New York City. They also needed to consult with experts and take tours of the equipment. They did lots of experiments and tests on dirigibles. It was also dangerous to have them land there. It was also bad for the enviroment because hydrogen is used and it's is highly flammable. Dirigibles can't dock there because it wasn't stable and that makes it not safe for people.	2	3		3																					
15162	6	"In the excerpt ""the Mooring Mast"", the author @ORGANIZATION2 explains some of the obstacles that the builders had to face in their attemp of allowing dirigibles dock on the mast of the Empire State Building.First of all, the dirigibles were big and heavy and needed space to land. @ORGANIZATION2 stated that ""some were... the same length as four blocks in New York City."" If the builders wanted to @CAPS1 dirigibles on top of the building, they would need a lot of space to build a big landing platform for a safe landing.Secondly, the decided that they could not land dirigibles on a flat roof and decided to tie it with a cable tether. The authors says ""the architects could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the... flat roof."" They realized that the weight of the dirigible would deform the buildings structure and that the strong winds could cause damages down to the foundation of the building.In conclusion, the workers faced many obstacles in order for them to @CAPS1 dirigibles on top of the State holding."	1	2		2																					
15167	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in building a mooring mast for airships to dock at the top building. The stress and preasure of a thousand foot dirigible docked at the top of the building was too great for the buildings original frame work to support, so they had to reinforce and strengthen the framework and base so the preasure would be transmitted to the buildings foundation. Another obstacle was most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen was much more flamible and the hydrogen dirigibles like the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed in fire and they didn't want that to happen over New york's population. The final obstacle was the violent and shifting air currents over the building. Even if the front of the dirigible or ""mast"" was tied to the mooring mast the back would swivel around the mooring mast. The many unseen obstacles of the mooring mast made it in unpracticle docking point for dirigibles. In the 1930s after airplanes, and dirigibles had disappeared the ticketing & bagging rooms were turned into tourist and site seers areas."	3	3		3																					
15168	6	"When the builders of the Empire State Building were in the process of building the docking station they ran into many @CAPS2. One of these @CAPS2 being the air currents at the top of the building. The dirigible would be unable to stay still and safely let off its passengers. Evidence to support this claim comes from the article itself when it says, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another obstacle the builders faced was the law. This law prohibited airships from flying low in a populated area. Therefore an airship trying to dock at the Empire State Building would be breaking the law. This was explained in paragraph fifteen of the article when it said, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" @CAPS1, it became very dangerous to dock these dirigibles in a populated area or near a building because there was the threat of them bursting into flame. Such as the dirigible Hindenburg in 1937. The article explains that the builders realized this new threat, ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been..."" @CAPS2 plagued the construction of the docks."	4	4		4																					
15171	6	"Al Smith was a guy who had an idea of making the world tallest building, and he didn't give up. In December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State building, goal height would reach 1,250 feet. He also wanted transportation to involve.The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, was the lack of landing area. Al Smith thought he could add a mooring mast to the top of the building and allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and let passengers on and off.One of the greatest obstacle to let the dirigibles docked there, was the weather. The dirigibles moored in open landing fields could weigh down, where it could dangle high above pedestrians on the street. It was also an existing. law against airships, flying too low over urban areas."	2	2		2

Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Even dirigles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, this could be dangerous for pedestrians. In paragraph @NUM3 they describe another reason why dirigles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. These are some examples of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles docking there."	4	4		4																					
15176	6	"There were many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the reasons was that the dirigible hanging by one cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. This stress would cause the buildings foundation to crack. This obstacle caused the architects to have to strengthen the foundation, this cost them over sixty thousand dollars in modifications. Another obstacle was they had to make another floor which would be used for passengers and would let elevators bring the passengers to the eighty-sixth floor, where their baggage and ticket area would be located. These observation areas were to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once this was done, they then had complete the roof before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. Another obstacle was nature itself, the winds at the top of the building were always shifting and the dirigibles, that usually land in open fields, could be weighted down with lead weights, but could not be used at the Empire State Building, where they would be hanging over pedestrians on the streets. Another obstacle was that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for dirigible to tie up or even approach the Empire State Building. All these many obstacles led to the ideas of dirigibles and mooring mast, for the dirigibles had dissapeared."	3	4		4																					
15177	6	"The builders of the empire state building attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there was a fuetle effort. The tried a numerous amount of different ways to approach this idea. There were a few different theorie's on what would be best, and how to develope the Mooring Mast by Al Smith and John Tauranac. Each man had a different thought on how the whole structure would turn out. The architects designed a new glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that ranged from the bottom to the top of the empire state Building. This structure helped support the mooring are, where the dirigibles were docked. But the fate of the Mast was not to bright. ""The Mooring Mast of the Empire state building was Never destined to fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" This statement is utterly true. And shows the work of the architects was never fully planned and over looked for the Mast to be durable."	1	0		1																					
15178	6	"Based on the excerpt the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in atteptin to allow dirigible to dock there were the fallowings. One obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The greater obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The dirigible couldn't do anything even if tethered it to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."	2	2		2																					
15180	6	"The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 is mainly about builders and architects attempting to put a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building in New York. At first, the main idea of the mooring mast was to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast to drop off and bring on passengers. The mooring mast was needed because ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" (paragraph @NUM1). One reason why this plan did not work out was because it was not safe, because the hydrogen that dirigibles use is highly flamable (and this could cause a serious fire). Also, if it was a windy day, the dirigibles could get pushed around by the winds. To stop this, they have lead weights to weight them down, but they cannot use these with all of the people and other buildings around. Also, dirigibles could not fly too low over these kinds of areas. Although the plan did not work, it was better to have everyone be safe."	4	4		4																					
15186	6	"Whenever architectural work is put in act, thoughts of the potential consequences should be thought out beforehand. In ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The blimps consist of dangerous chemicals and, ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium,"" and hydrogen is extremely flammable. A possibility of flames could result in a ruined building, and even worse, a destroyed city. Although fires were a problem to consider, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This building is extremely high in the sky, therefore the winds get quite brutal. If a blimp was tied to the mast, the back of the ship continuously swivel and ruin the fabric of the aircraft. A mooring mast was just not a bright idea for a large city like New York. The population was too large, and the area was too crowded. The obstacles the architects faced were serious, and they helped the team to kill the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."	3	4		4																					
15190	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges in building a dock for dirigibles They would not be able to simply place of mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. The thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable would make the frame very unsturdy. With the weight of the dirigible and the wind pressure it would have to get transmitted to eleven hundred feet, where the foundation is. The would need to make the frame stronger to with stand the stress which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. In the end the mooring mast never was made because of safety, unpredictable nature and of the law itself. It was unsafe due to the highly flammable dirigibles putting the high populated region in danger. The winds would shift to constantly and violently and be to very difficult to control the dirigible. Also, the law that airships flying too low over urban areas would have made it illegal. Ships would not be able to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Overall, there were too many obstacles that made it impossible for the engineers to build a mooring mast."	3	4		4																					
15192	6	"The dirigibles were not able to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building for obvious reasons. When the construction workers were building the mast, they didn't realize how dangerous it was having a dirigible landing on the top of the building. There were a few cautions that the workers realized. First off, if the dirigible catches on fire like the one in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then a lot of people would be at risk because it is such a big city with massive amounts of people. Another reason they realized after was that it was too dangerous for the dirigible to land there due to the high swirling winds. If they tried landing there, but the violent winds wouldn't let them, then it would not be the least bit safe. This is how the workers of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there."	2	2		2																					
15194	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were: The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.

That is why this idea was unpractical and unsafe.Another obstacle in allowing dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building's mast was nature itself.

Problems with safety is the lead wieght be dangling high above pedestrians on the street which was niether practical or safe.

In ¶ @NUM3 it says that there was an existing law against flying airship above urban areas."	2	3		3																					
15199	6	"The Empire State Building was an incredible building without the idea of the attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. But with this idea of this mooring mast it braught up many obstacles like the safety of the public. Lüsted states ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This statement proves that if the dirigible were catch fire like the accident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then the citizens of New York's lives would be at stake. This safety hazard is one of the builder's problems.     These archatets faced many challenges with this mooring mast idea. Including the dangerous factor of nature. Lüsted states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This is extremely dangerous because the dirigibles start to move around the building while docked causing hazardous menuvers and putting pedestrian's lives at risk.

15205	6	"From the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attenting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the designing as well as the cost of this project could encounter problems. Such as, ""add stress to the building's frame."" If the mass interfered with the frame of the building, then changing the material of the building could cost ""over sixty thousand dollars!"" In addition, safety was a major component when trying to construct the mooring mast. For example, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen...and hydrogen is highly flammable."" New York is a very populated area, which means when building a mooring mast, safety must be considered into perspective. Lastly, their were restrictions on airships flying too close to cities. As it states in the excerpt, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Overall, when constructing the mooring mast, many builders were blind to the potential problems, making the project unsuccessful."	3	3		3																					
15207	6	"Based on the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there were, the strong wind currents, the fact that dirigibles were very flammable, and that they were very large and hard to keep still. In paragraph @NUM1 it states that the use of hydrogen rather than helium should have stopped the project. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it states that the biggest obstacle was nature itself. For the reasons above those are some of the obstacles builders faced in attempting to have dirigibles dock there."	2	2		2																					
15211	6	"The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building was unrealistic because there was a lack of identification of possible flaws in this plan. As a new form of transportation, dirigbles were not safe. This was proven true when the German dirigble, ""Hindenburg"", exploded in 1937. In addition, a more significant obstacle that was not adressed when the plan was created was the problem with its location. In the crowded streets of New York City, suspending flamable dirigibles above population is unsafe. This location is also an obstacle because of the equipment needed to land the dirigible: lead weights. The use of lead weights to way down the dirigibles is unimaginable with the possible dangerous situations it could create. The creators of this idea solely designed this system on top of the Empire State building to incorporate a futuristic form of transportation to make the building more unique. The Empire State building builders and encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their because the concept was far past the capabilities of their age."	2	2		2																					
15212	6	"Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced are dirigibles use hydrogen to float. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas and if it was ignited it was cause a lot of property damage. Also at 1,250 ft there is a lot of wind. The dirigible would blow around the building causing unnatural stress to the building. It would be very difficult to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."	1	2		2																					
15213	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.In designing the mast, the steel frame of the State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new siteation, @MONEY1' worth of modifications were made to the buildings framework, Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself.The mooring mast failed. Most dirigibles from outside of the @ORGANIZATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. Weather, such as violent air currents, were the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mast."	3	3		3																					
15215	6	"During the construction of the dirigible dock at the Empire State Building, architects and builders were faced with many obstacles. Before the mooring mast was installed at the top of the building, it became evident that ""the stress of the dirigible's load... would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" (paragraph @NUM1). This meant that changes would need to be made in the framework in order to support the weight. In addition, safety, weather, and legal issues were at hand. Filled with flamable gas, there was always a risk of a dirigible catching fire, and in an urban area the damage would be extremely bad. Winds at the top of the building were also dangerous. Air currents were ""violent"" and ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around"" (paragraph @NUM2). Normally, the ships would be weighted down, but, again, this was not possible in a city. The last issue builders faced was the law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). Although there was a law clearly against it, two dirigibles attempted to dock. Both attempts were failures and it became clear that the Empire State Building would not be able to serve as a dirigible landing."	3	4		4																					
15228	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. According to the author, ""... was destined to never fulfill its purpose [Empire State building being a dock for dirigibles], for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" As the author points out, there were many problems with this idea. The reasons were: safety, strong winds, and laws prohibiting this to happen. The safety issue was that the dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable. In fact the Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. If a dirigibles burst into flames while near the Empire State Building, it would be very harmful to the many people in the city around the building. Strong winds were another problem because the Empire State Building is so high, the winds at the mooring station would be violent and unpredicting. This would make it difficult to land at the mooring station and if it successfully did attach, the back end of the dirigibles would be blown around by the wind. The final problem was that there was a law forbidding aircraft to be a certain distance from a city. This law was trying to prevent aircraft from crashing into city. With all of these problems, it is clear that this plan could never have worked effectively."	3	4		4																					
15231	6	"One obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was, ""the lack of a suitable landing area."" New York City is full of buildings and there is not a lot a flat ground to land a dirigible. The builders second obstacle was that they couldn't find a way to get the mooring mast on top of the building. The builders would need to make a stronger building frame so the mast could safely be on the top of the building without adding stress to the frame. Another obstacle that the builders faced was nature. The wind at the top of the building was very unpredictable and strong at times. The back of the dirigible would move from the wind, even if it was tied to the building. The last reason was that there was a law that wouldn't allow the dirigibles to fly that low over an urban area. Therefore, the dirigibles couldn't dock at the Empire State Building."	3	4		4																					
15236	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles while trying to build the mast. One problem was that there was a lot of pressure and stress that would be put on the building if a dirigible was to dock there. This was because of the high wind speeds and of the sheer size of the dirigible. The designers had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the building's framework to account for the pressure. Another obstacle was that there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that the dirigibles would not be allowed to even get close to the building, let alone dock on it. Eventually, these obstacles and other safety issues, such as hydrogen inside, the blimp being highly flammable, caused the idea to dissappear."	3	2		3																					
15245	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles as an attempt to allow dirigible to dock there.  In paragraph @NUM1 it shows an obstacle the builders spaced.

15246	6	"In the Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. To dock, a moor mast was necessary. One could not simply Place one on the empire state building because it would add stress to the buildings frame. Also, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add stress, which would force more modifications to the frame costing upwards of sixty thousand dollars. The mooring mast was not completed mainly because of safety. After the combustion of the Hindenburg, owners of the Empire State Building realized a disaster it would cause if it hapened in New York. Nature was also an obstacle, with constantly changing violent air currents threatening to move the dirigible, which could not be anchored down as it could be in a field. It was a risk not worth taking. Lastly, a law passed earlier prevented dirigibles from even approaching buildings on such elevation over urban areas. These were the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	4		4																					
15263	6	"Al Smith faced some obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles dock on the mast on top of the Empire State building. The first problem him and the architects faced was they couldnt just put the mast on top of the building's flat roof. The mast would add stress to the buildings frame. Also, the dirigibles load and the wind would add stress. Another reason was safety. Most dirigibles used Hydrogen which was highly flammable. Also, the winds at the top of the building had violent currents. The winds were always shifting which would cause the back of the ship to move. Lastely, the dirigibles couldnt fly near the building because there was a law against air crafts flying to low over urban areas which made it illegal for dirigibles to tie to the mast anyways."	3	3		3

15301	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was that if a dirigible was moored by a single tether, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" Another obstacle was that most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, and when the Hindenburg was destroyed, builders realized that accident would have been much worse if it had happened ove a densely populated area like New York City. A third obstacle was violent wind currents that would cause the back of the ship to swivel around, and the back of the dirigible couldn't be weighted down like in open landing fields because that would cause the weights to dangle dangerously above that pedestrians on the street. These were major obstacles, and they are the reasons that the mast on top of the Empire State Building was never used dock blimps."	4	4		4																					
15310	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it focuses on the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Laws made it impossible for the original purpose of the mast, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."". Some dirigibles did try, but due to wind and safety reasons the idea was dropped. The safety of all human beings took part in the construction, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire...the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area..."". When dealing with other countries you have to take into account that they may not use the safest things. Mother Nature can be a funny thing, ""The winds on top of the building were constely shifting..."". With the wind changing at a moment's notice it can be hard for a ship to land. When building something always be prepared for obstacles."	3	3		3																					
15322	6	"The excerpt of The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted reveals that the architects of the Empire State faced a number of obstacles. Not only was the construction of the building now competive, but its expectations were unrealistic. The idea for such a masterpiece of a building held a number of potential problems that its architects not very competitive. As the work-in-progress of the Chrysler building grew, the Empire State Building strived to be taller. In order to achieve greater heights, its architects suggested and addition of a mooring mast, to not only make the building the tallest, but to add to its purpose. The addition of a mooring mast would require a lot of planning, though. If a giant steel framed balloon were to dock at the top of the building as is, it could dangerously shake the foundation of the building, so the frame of the building had to be rebuilt much stronger. Also, the architects didn't realized the danger of docking dirigibles. Dirigibles, or blimps, were fueled by hydrogen, which is very flammable, and proved a threat to the thousands of people living below."	2	2		2																					
15333	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Wind caused a great problem in the docking of the dirigibles ""The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze"" (para 6). The swinging of the dirigibles body would cause pulling on the building that the building's current frame wouldn't be able to support. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" (para @NUM1). The builders of the Empire State Building now had to strengthen and modify the building's frame to suit the stress of the dirigibles' loads Another obstacle that the builders of the building faced was the framing of the mast. The roof had to be completed before the mast's framing could take place. The workers had to work for another two monts after the building was already complete due to Al Smith's idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The builders worked hard to suit the new building for the docking of dirigibles. Unfortunately their work was for nothing."	3	3		3																					
15334	6	"Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building created many obstacles for its builders. Some of which weren't even discovered until finally attempting to do it.The first of the builders problems started with trying to prepare the actual building for the added stress that would be applied when having dirigibles try to dock. They spent @MONEY1 on modifications to reinforce the framework of the building. Then ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower..."" This created lots of unnecessary work for the workers, as well as made obstacles.There was also a lot of danger associated with docking dirigibles that the builders had to deal with. The violent changing air currents would require them to make the mast as sturdy as possible and account for the movement of the dirigibles. Finally the builders find out the biggest obstacle which is that it is legal for airships to fly that low over urban areas, so technically they weren't even allowed to do what they did. Thinking back on it, it is obvious to see that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose..."""	3	3		3																					
15335	6	"There were some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the violent wind currents that made the dirigibles rear swivel, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around."" A second obstacle was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, which made the mast nearly useless. A third obstacle was that foreign dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable. After the dirigible called ""The Hindenburg"" was destroyed, ""the owners realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as New York. Those are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	3		4																					
15338	6	"The wind was a huge issue when building the empire state building. The building was so high off the ground that the top was not as stable. If they used dirigibles on the Empire State building it would be dangerous because the weights would be dangling high in the air over all of the pedestrians heads. That plan was not smart or safe. The purpose to build it higher was just so it could be the tallest building, there was really no good reasons for it."	1	2		2																					
15340	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First the building had a flat roof and a dirigible moored to the top, only held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame. Modifications to the building would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Other problems the building faced had to do with safety. Some dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable and if an accident were to happen in New York it would be disastrous. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting and even tethered to the mooring mast, the ship would not be secured. This was also very unsafe. The Empire State Building never succeeded it's purpose."	3	3		3																					
15345	6	"Builders faced many obstacles such as safety, nature, flammability and law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mast. The first problem is ""the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose."" The dirigibles also, use hydrogen not helium, which is very flammable. The Hindenburg, a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey and, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse [it] could have been if it [happened] over densely populated area such as New York. The violent air currents also played a role, the back of the ship would swivel around and around. When dirigibles moored in landing fields they would be weighted down with lead weights, which would be dangerous for pedestrians on the street. Also, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. There was no way dirigibles would be able to dock at the mast"	3	3		3																					
15348	6	"There were many obstacles that the Empire State buildings owner faced. One obstacle was not having enough room for the dirigible to land. To help solve this problem, the architect added mooring mast to increase the buildings height. Another obstacle was that the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be expanded in order for there to be more height added to the building. Altogether this would cost over @MONEY1. The main reason, and obstacle was safety. The owner had to make sure that the dirigible was not flammable, in which it was. Wind and nature also played a big part in deciding to go through with the idea. The strong winds would make the dirigible swing and constantly shift. This would make the dirigible hang over people on the streets of New York, which was not safe. The idea that landing dirigibles on top of the empire state building was neither safe or practical, and there were just too many struggles and obstacles for a plan like this to ever follow through."	3	3		3																					
15351	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, one was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@NUM1) This shows that docking dirigibles can be harmful as some buildings and many people can be negatively affected. The large business district is too densely populated to allow such a thing. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM2) This obstacle builders faced brought up that lives are yet again in danger, not to mention very expensive damage that allowing dirigibles can cause. Another obstacle builders faced was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM3) All of these obstacles that the builders faced were very important and paved the way for the idea of dirigibles to be docked attop of the Empire State Building to be disarmed. The dangers involved were too significance and the top of the building now much safer purposes."	3	3		3																					
15352	6	"There were many problems with the designing of the dirigible docking system. The first of these problems comes from the practicality of the consept. The winds created by the updrafts in the cities are violent and making landing a blimp too risky, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another obsticale that was faced was the strutural design. The Empire State Building was not originally designed to moor blimps, and modifying the building to do so was expensive, ""over @NUM1 doolars' worth of modifications,"" The final obsticale was the fact that there were laws in place stopping airships from flying too low over buildings, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" These impracticalities prooved to be challenging obsticales"	3	3		3																					
15353	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building planned to use the building to make New York the leader in modern travel. They built a mooring mast which they planned to use to dock dirigibles. Unfortunately, there were some unexpected difficulties and this goal was never accomplished.When the architects first decided to add the mast to the Empire State Building, they realized that they would have to redesign the entire building's support structure because of the pressure that a docked dirigible would put on the building. Even after this problem was solved, there were numerous obsticles keeping the goal from being reached.The architects had failed to see many of the potential problems with the mast. Not until after the mast was built did they realized that most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium to stay afloat. Hydrogen, being highly flammable was not a risk that the builders wanted to take over the densely populated city. The architects also realized that the unpredictable high winds at the top of the mast would be too dangerous to dock a dirigible.Once these obsticles appeared, it became evident that the Empire State Building would never dock a dirigible."	3	3		3																					
15356	6	"When attempting to add a mooring mask to the Empire State Building, the people who were adding it faced several impediments. Right away, the builders took the size of a dirigible into account. If there were something that large at the top of the building, the frame would be warped. To solve this problem, they had to spend over sixty thousand dollars to change the original framework, to a more suitable one. Another obsticle faced by the builders of the mast, was that they had made sharp edges on the building that could damage a drigible attempting to dock. Also, they realized that the mast was above a large urban area, so if there would be an accident, bad situations would take place. There was also a law about aircraft traveling too low over a City. The drigible mooring dock atop the Empire State Building was not meant to be."	3	3		3																					
15367	6	"Problems the builders of the Empire State Building cam across were some tricky, life threatening ones. The first being as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. When it explains that if a dirigible was to try and dock and something went wrong and it caught on fire, their would be serious damage done to the people below on the streets. Another obstacle the builders had to deal with was the ""greatest obstacle"" in paragraph @NUM2. the fact that the wind a top of the tower would be whipping the dirigible around with just a cable holding it to the mooring mast. Not making it safe for anyone around the building or in the blimp. One other reason the builders had to figure out when building the mast, was that no airships flying low could enter the area as mentioned in paragraph @NUM3. Those are some of the problems the builders had to face if they wished to dock dirigibles on the building."	3	3		3																					
15374	6	During the construction of the Empire State Building the builders had to face many @CAPS1 in attempting to allow driggibles to dock there.     In the reading selection The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted it discusses many of the @CAPS1 that were faced. For an example an obstacle they had to face was finding a landing area because there was a huge lack of suitable landing area in New York City. The second @CAPS1 they faced was how to make dirigible's global so they had a meeting with the president of a formed airship transport company would use the dirigable's service across the pacific ocean. The architects had meetings with the government about safeways of mooring airships to this mast.     The builders went through many @CAPS1 to use the dirigibles but eventually it wasn't enough to Put the Plan into affect.	1	1		1																					
15378	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the problems was that a thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable tether would add stress to the frame. The obstacle they went through was to make the frame stronger. In paragraph @NUM1 it states the obstacle they went through to make the building stronger. ""the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower."" and ""The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners.""Other obstacles they went through was making sure the mooring mast was tall enough, and in paragraph @NUM2 Smith says, ""people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."""	2	2		2																					
15385	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring @CAPS1 by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building had a hard task on their hands. They were building the tallest building in the world and when Al Smith, the head in the construction of the building, said to make it taller things got even more difficult. Mainly because they wanted this newfound height to be used as a dock for dirigibles. What they didn't know is that it is a little more difficult than just tying up a blimp to a building. They had many obstacles at hand. The architects would have to modify the building because a thousand-foot dirigible moored on the building would add stress to the building. Dirigibles used hydrogen which is extremely flamable, if it were to catch on fire in downtown New York it would be desasterous. Nature poses a threat as well, the winds on  top of the building would cause the dirigible to swivle around. The final obstacle is there is a law that prohibits airships to fly to low in urban areas.

15399	6	"The Empire State building is one of the tallest buildings ever built. It way because of this, that it was impossible for a blimp to dock on the mooring mast. The article by @ORGANIZATION1 titled ""The Mooring Mast"" describes well the problem blimps may have encountered. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The wins on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" It's true, should a blimp try to moor there it would do nothing but twirl around the mooring mast. It could also crash into other buildings. It could tear up the mooring mast. There was so much the builders didn't look into."	2	2		2																					
15412	6	The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's roof because it would add stressing to the building's frames. So they had to modify the building's frames to strengthen them. Also most dirigibles rather use hydrogen which is highly flammable and destroy a population of New York. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds constantly shifted and the back of the dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast making it unsafe for the pedestrians below. Finally another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the building was because there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas.	3	3		3																					
15422	6	"The problems the builders had in attempting to build the Empire State Building were first of all, the dirigible would have to be tied to the mast and the single cable tether would ""stress the buildings frame."" In paragraph @NUM1, the author says that the wind pressure and the weight of the dirigible could not be supported by the current foundation and so the frame would have to be made stronger and changed. The final problem was when ""Columbia"" delivered newspaper to the Empire State building. The mooring equipment was not installed because of previous problems with the design, laws and common sense used when making this building. The rest of the problems had to do with the obliviousness of reality due to the actual effectivness of the building."	2	2		2																					
15424	6	"The @CAPS1 who made the Mooring mast faced many obstacals when trying to get dirigibles to dock. Some were safty, nature its self, and pre existing laws.

Winds at the top were always changing and could make the dirigibles crash to the mast. An existing law prevented airships to fly too low in urban cities. For all the work the @CAPS1 put into the mast it could never live up to its potential."	1	2		2																					
15434	6	One obstacle the builders had to face was the amount of wind that was blowing that high in the air. The dirigibles were so big that the wind had a lot of resistance on them and made them sway from the back.Another obstacle was that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which is highly flamable Being filled up with such a flamable gas it could easily turn into a disaster. Especially with all the people who were so close to it on the ground.	2	2		2																					
15439	6	When building the Empire State Building the @CAPS1 wanted to keep it the tallest in New York. They modified the buildings that it would not be succeeded by the chrystler building. It's original property was not to be a mooring mast. The empire state building had to be refraimed then the government banned aircraft too low then commercial airliners took over the avaiting industry. It was too dangerious for dirigibles to dock because the strong currents can blow them out of place causing accidents similar to the hindinburg.	1	2		2																					
15444	6	"According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced three main obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The first obstacle was concern of public safety. Dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen, which is a highly flammable element. An accident in a densely populated area like New York could be catastrophic. The second obstacle were the violent winds on top of the building. Using lead weights to tie down dirigibles was not practical, because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. A mishap would send those heavy weights flying down and causing destruction. The third obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building illegal and out of question"	3	3		3

15479	6	In the story construction workers faced a problem. The idea of having a dirigible's dock ontop of the empire State Building was comming to an end. When thinking about the idea the architecture Never put thought in legal persasures as in air crafts cant fly low on urban areas. Also the heavy wind that picks up from the building making the air craft hard to controll. Another was the dangers they could inflict to civilians. If not @CAPS1 right the air craft can get loose and dingle down to urban areas or like the german dirigible catch on fire and Blow up. Even though they had a prototype that work they discontinued the project giving air planes the better way to travel in the air.	3	2		3																					
15480	6	There's more than one obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there. The biggest obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why blimps could not moor on the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.	2	2		2																					
15485	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1 there are many reasons that a proper, working Mast was impossible. there were natural reasons and mechanical reasons. As well as time and safety. Nature played a key role in this project. The winds around the building ""were constantly shifting"" because of the location of the building. When the to blimps attempted to go near to test it out One was too unstable to dock and the other through paper down a rope ""after this stunt the idea of the mooring mast was shelved."" @CAPS1 replaced the blimps over time and blimps wher flammable and dangerouse. Also, flying at that hight is illegal."	2	2		2																					
15486	6	"When the builders were almost ready to place the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, big problems became apparent to them that caused complications in docking dirigibles. One factor was that by law, dirigibles couldn't be that low above the city, as they could accidently  crash into a building and fall onto the crowds below. Another factor was the air currents around the tall buildings, especially the Empire State Building at a height of 1,250 feet. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the winds would violently rock it, and could crash against the building and fall to the streets below. A recent factor arose when the Hindenburg dirigible burst into flames from the hydrogen in it when it flew over New Jersey on May 6, 1937. Nobody wanted to risk that happening over New York City, either. So because of flammable hydrogen, violent air currents, and by law, the builders had complications when building the mooring mast to allow dirigibles to land there."	3	4		4																					
15492	6	"There were a handful of problems that came along with the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building.  This idea was hardly practical, for safety reasons mostly.  If a dirigible docked there on one cable, extreme tension would be put on the building.  Also, if an international dirigible were to dock filled with very flammable hydrogen and catch fire, the results would be catostrophic.The task of actually docking would be a problem as well.  With such a high altitude, winds were very strong.  Nothing could prevent the dirigibles from swinging around the building.  In other situations, dirigibles would be weighted down with lead weights.  However, if these were to fall, they would land in the busy city streets of New York.  Lastly, there was a law against low flying air ships, completely dismissing the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
15499	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly due to structeral and safty issues. According to paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This problem required over sixty thousand dollares' worth of modifications to the buildings framework. Although structural issues were a problem, the safety of the pidestrians created a even bigger obstacle for the builders.Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium which created huge fire hazzards ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York"" (paragraph @NUM2). Even though the exsisting law against airships flying too low over urban areas prevented dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building, the biggest obstacle of them all was nature itself. The dirigibles shells could be punctured by the winds constantly shifting due to violent air currents."	4	3		4																					
15501	6	"The first obstacle is being able to get the passengers on and off due to the height they are already at. Also as stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 therefore the power of the wind is a huge obstacle. Another obstacle stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS1 the law was another obstacle they had to face."	3	3		3																					
15510	6	"In the @DATE1's, dirigibles were known as the transportation of the future. After the Empire State Building was built, the builder's attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. There were three main reasons that prevented the builders from attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, at the top of the Empire State Building. ""The one obstacle to there expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Al Smith thought that if a mooring mast was added to the top of the building, it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for hours. But it was not easy for the architects to drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the moorin Mast was nature itself."" The violent air currents from the wind, would caused the back of the ship to Swivel around the moorin mast.

In the end two dirigibles attempted it, but it did'nt work."	4	3		2																					
15511	6	Their were many obstacles builder face while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building. The first problem they faced was safety. Alot of dirigible especialy those from out side the unitestates used hydrogen which is highly @CAPS1. So this was not safe in a place with a big number of population like down town New York to have a dirigible fly that low. It is not safe because In case of an accident there could be a large amount of deaths. The second ob stacle the builders faced was that the winds on the top were constantly blowing and could not allow the dirigible to stable in one place. Instead it would just go around and around the mast. The third and last obstacle that the builders faced was the law. There was a law that did not allow air ships to fly too low over urban areas. So It was illegal for a ship to be tied on the Empire state building.	3	2		3																					
15518	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of them was not being able to just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A dirigible attached the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would stress the building frame. Its weight and air pressure would weaken the foundation of the Empire State Building. They had to make sixty thousand dollars worth modifications to the frame work so it could be strong enough to with stand the weight of the dirigibles. Another problem the mooring mast not fulfilling its purpose, which should have been thought about before it was built; safety. Many countries outside the U.S used hydrogen instead of helium, hydrogen is really flammable. There was an inccident where a blimp was destroyed in a fire due to hydrogen in their balloon. The biggest challenge was the wind above the building. The wind was constantly shifting because of violent air currents. If the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would turn on the mooring mast. Blimps use weights to land in open fields but couldn't over the Building because weights dangling over pedstrians wasn't safe.

Their first problem was that they could not drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire state building. Mainly because it's only held by a single tether, and because it would add stress to the buildings frame. Another @CAPS1 is that the wind speeds were so much greater in the top of the building that it pushed the dirigibles away from the docking station. Also, most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium to stay aloft, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. For the creators of the building, The idea just seemed unpractical, a dirigible would be to hard to keep in one place dangling @NUM1 feet in the air above New York City."	3	2		3																					
15544	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was finding a way to have a dirigible moored on top of the Empire State building without adding stress to the buildings frame. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (Lüsted). Another obstacle that was face was money. they needed to make more than sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (Lüsted). The biggist obstacle the builders had to face was nature, the winds would shift the dirigible to much. ""The greatest obstacle to the success of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (Lüsted). As you can see there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	2	2		2																					
15550	6	"There were several obstacles to the success of the construction. Perhaps the main obstacle, the obstacle that nothing could be done about, was the wind itself. On paragraph @NUM1 it mentions how the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These giant- balloon like machines would constantly swivel around the mooring mast even if they were tied down. The Hindenburg disaster in May 6, 1937 also proved how dangerous it would be to have blimps filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas over a densely populated area, like downtown New York. The project was also held back by existing laws about flight in an urban area. ""It was illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" -says the author on paragraph @NUM2. Incoming blimps would simply be flying too low against law for this to work."	3	3		3																					
15555	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 wanted to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building for refueling and services and to let passengers off and on. However, the builders of the Empire State Building went through many obstacles to allow this to happen. ""The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION3 in Lakehurst, New Jersey"" (¶@NUM1). They had to meet with experts and analyze if that was going to be a successful idea. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed....the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (¶'s @NUM2 & @NUM3). Another obstacle that the builders had to deal with was nature. the winds up there were very strong, therefore the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was not successful."	2	2		2																					
15568	6	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were. The used of hydrogen rather than helium because hydrogen is highly flammable. The obstacles of it was nature itself. There's always strong and dangerous winds on top of the building. So it makes it possible for the dirigible to swivel around which is dangerous. Dirigibles moored in the open landing fields could be weighed down but, using these at the Empire State Building can dangling high above pedestrians which is not safe. Another reason is the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. If the dirigible blows the sharp spires of the building can puncture the dirigible's shell. These are the reasons and obstacles why its hard to attempt the dock of the dirigibles."	4	3		4																					
15572	6	"The builders of the empire state building face a lot of problems on trying to make a dock for dirigibles.  The builders could not just simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof.  They had to think about how the dirigible @LOCATION2 fair, they had to strengten the foundation of the building and a landing area for the dirigible.  Dirigibles were able to dock him by means of an electric winch The problem with this is they were in Downtown New York and New York city was a densely populated area.  A dirigible floating in the middle of a largely populated area would be very unsafe.  Also a dirigible is made of hydrogen and helium and hydrogen is very flammable.  So if an accident happens and a dirigible was destroyed, people below would be dead.  Another obstacle was the law, Airships cannot fly too low over urban areas.  The greatest obsticle of them all though was nature itself The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  This idea sounded great at first, but too many things could go wrong."	4	4		4																					
15577	6	"The obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was dificult. The builder met with experts to better understand the way the dirigibles work. He also was told that architects couldn't put a mooring mast on top because of the buildings flat roof. Paragraph nine States a thousand-foot dirigible- held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" The stress would then be passed all the way down to the buildings foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. The builder put over sixty thousand dollars' worth of changes into the building. After all that time and money he was told that the plan would have to fall through. The dirigibles greatest obstacle was the wind, if it moved in the air that could be a problem. Although this plan didnt work, its still 1,250 ft and taller than the Chrysler building."	3	3		3																					
15578	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" a historical article by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it is made clear that there were at least three obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. These issues were the building's pre-existing frame, fire safety, and nature itself. The plans for the Empire State Building had not intended a mooring mast to be dropped on the roof of the building. As a result, architects had to change their entire plan: ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" (par. @NUM1). This was a significant difficulty. Also a concern for foreign dirigibles was that the gas the use made fire safety and issue: ""... the owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area,"" (par. @NUM2). Getting around the fire hazard would be impossible. Finally, as stated in the article, nature was the mast's greatest obstacle. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" (par. @NUM3). The violent winds kept much from happening with the mast. With the three aforementioned obstacles, the fate of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was grim. It would never do what Al Smith had intended for it."	3	3		3																					
15581	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders faced many obstacles. The main issue that was not noticed till the end; was that it was an enormous safety problem. The builders wanted to make the mooring mast a docking point for dirigibles, blimps, and zeppelins from the country and from other countries, but other countries used hydrogen, rather than helium; and hydrogen is extremely flammable. A fire over a metropolis such as New York would be catastrophic! Also, dirigibles used large lead weights to weigh them down. Using them in a city dangling over pedestrians would be neither practical, nor safe."	2	2		2																					
15590	6	"Throughout the story workers of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacles they faced was trying to ge a thousend foot drigible mooring at the top of the building. This was held together by a single cable tether and that would add stress to the buildings frame. All the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, but that was eleven hundred feet below. Another obstacle is that hydrogen in the dirigible was highly flammable. If a dirigible was ever destroyed it would kill a lot of people because the Empire State Building is in downtown New York. The greatest obstacle was that the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing so would be very difficult to land. The last obstacle was it was against the law for airships to fly too low in urban areas."	3	3		3																					
15592	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it explains how the developing idea of landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building was eventually rejected due to many obstacles. The first design flaw that the engineers @CAPS2 was the stress the dirigible would add to the building's frame. A mass that size attached to the building by a single cable tether would be @CAPS1 in the building's foundation. The greatest obstacle the engineers @CAPS2 in allowing dirigibles to dock was safety. With the use of hydrogen, the dirigibles are highly flammable. This would have created a dangerous situation ove a ""densely populated area such as downtown New York"". The final obstacle the builders @CAPS2 was the wind. The winds at that height were extremely strong. Chapter @NUM1 it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would create a dangerous situation for the ship's passengers. In ""The Mooring Mast"", it described how it would be nearly impossible to land dirigibles atop the Empire State Building."	4	3		4																					
15596	6	"Allowing dirigibles stock at the Empire State Building was never possible because of the obstacles that the architects faced. First, nature was against the builders. The strong winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting, which proved a hazard to dirigibles. Mooring dirigibles would lead weights was out of the question because they were a danger to pedestrians. Another obstacle was an already existing law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building. The final obstacle was that a dirigible could be accidentally ignited and fall on New York. The destruction of the Hindenburg made clear that it was not possible to have a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
15604	6	"Some obstacles that the empire state builders had while creating the Empire state building is having to deal with all fast winds. This reason being is because the giant needle that was build on top of the building was waving back an forth. which mad it harder to keep in place.Another obstacle would be, @CAPS1 bringing the dirigible or blimps towards the giant needle. It would pouncher the blimp. There was only made of cotton fabric."	1	1		1																					
15607	6	"This dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible was a dream that would be hard-to-reach. The architects and engineers that attempted to establish a mooring mast had high hopes, including meeting with the president. ""Held by a single cable tether"" would not be stable enough to mount the dirigible because the building frame would be stress to too much. What if they were to do this, the Empire State Building have to be modified and strengthened to adapt to the new placement of the dirigible. But instead the architects assigned a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower"" and then designed the mooring mast. However, before the mooring mast could be complete, the roof had to be completed before the mooring mast could fit in its position most of portly the main problem with the mooring mast was nature. Nature could easily mess up the mooring mast, due to winds, which would cause the shifting of the dirigible. Also due to a ""law against airships flying too low"" the dirigible would break that law as well. The whole attempt to make a mooring mast slowly deteriorated because of all the obstacles."	3	4		4																					
15609	6	The builders had many obstacles in their way to accomplish their Idea of docking dirigibles. One main problem was that most dirigibles around the world used hydrogen gas which is highly flammable which can make things very dangerous at such an altitude.                                                 The greatest obstacle to it's success was nature itself. The winds where the docking would occur were constantly shifting and this would make the stability of the dirigible very difficult with the back end stretching so far away from the tower. Another reason this wouldn't work was because of an already existing law against air ships flying so low over urban areas.	3	3		3																					
15615	6	"Competitive architect Al Smith wanted the Empire State Building to be the tallest most unique building. ""Their top, they said, would serve a higher calling"" (@NUM1). The Building was supporting the age of transportation by dirigible. Al Smith commented ""It's on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now"" (@NUM2). In reality the architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast. There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One great reason was safety. If any dirigibles from outside the United States used to the mast it could be highly flammable due to using hydrogen rather helium. Another reason was nature itself. Shifting winds due to violent air currents made it dangerous as the back of the ship would twist around the mooring mast. Most importantly an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. That law would then make it illegal for a ship to ever tied to a building. By the late 1930s dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes."	3	3		3																					
15617	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle being the safety of the people below on the streets. In the excerpt in paragraph @NUM1 it clearly states that it was dangerous because of the dirigible caught fire it would be ""Much worse if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" Another obstacle would be that there is a law that is stated in paragraph @NUM2 that says that there is ""An existing law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The greatest obstacle though was nature itself as stated in paragraph @NUM3. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1 the wind would make the dirigible swivel around and around the mooring mast. An idea came into plan that said ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights,"" @CAPS1 why not at the Empire State Building? Safety is the reason because the weight on the building would be dangling above people on the street which would be unsafe. Then flyers who approached the building would fear that the wind would blow the dirigible on to the sharp spires of other buildings in the area which would be unsafe."	4	4		4																					
15621	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Strong winds due to violent air currents would make it impossible to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building. The wind would blow the dirigible off the mast into New York City. In paragraph @NUM2 under ""The Fate of the Mast"", a line states ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law made it illegal for dirigibles and other aircraft to even fly in such and urban area like New York. One final obstacle is safety precautions. In paragraph @NUM3 a line states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium."" If a dirigible were to crash and it had this highly flammable gas it would create a massive disaster. Violent winds, laws, and safety precautions are all against the docking of dirigibles at the mooring mast."	4	3		4

15630	6	Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building came with a lot of obstacles to make it work. One obstacle is their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Some dirigibles were as long ase one thousand feet long which is equal to four blocks in New York City. Another obstacle is they could not drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof.

Also, the reality of the construction and location was a future problem for the workers. The process was a troubling challenge overall.It was not very safe to have a large aircraft with passengers hanging over a large city. One percaution that was of great concern was that other dirigibles used hydrogen, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The potential of having a fire over a city was a risk that they could not face. The dirigibles were not even allowed by law to get close enough to the Empire State Building to dock. The workers had to face reality when it came to the construction and location. The mast was so high up that dirigibles would not be able to dock because of ""violent air currents."" Some blimps did not even have the proper ""mooring equipment installed.""

These obstacles were very difficult to solve.      In the dirigibles, there are filled with hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flamable if the dirigibles caught on fire. It is also dangerous to be above a very densely populated area because if the dirigible ever failed, it would fall on inocent bystanders. It also is dangerous because the winds shift a lot, and it can get popped by other objects or buildings around the dirigible. Thus, why it is difficult to turn the mast into a loading dock for dirigibles.         Turning the mast on the Empire State Building into a loading dock for dirigibles is very difficult to do because it is not safe."	3	3		3																					
15648	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" it shows that it was not easy making the dirigibles a safe docking station.A struggle that was faced during this time was that dirigibles from other countries were made with hydrogen which is highly flammable.

With all this wind it was hard for pilots of dirigibles to steer.

15652	6	"Based on the article, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, including the overall structure of the building being affeted by stress from the dirigible, safety issues, and the impact of nature. To start off, the dirigible's weight plus the wind pressure around the building, caused too much stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the building would have to be strengthened and modified in order for the dirigible to be docked onto it. This modification and strengthening of the building process would call for an investment of over sixty thousand dollars. Next, the safety issue arose after being neglected before the building process began. Most dirigibles there were used outside of the United States contained hydrogen, which is a highly flammable gas, as opposed to using helium. This was a serious problem for a German dirigible named Hindenburg, when it was destroyed by fire in New Jersey in 1937. @ORGANIZATION2 writes ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1). This was a major obstacle along with the wind factor. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting and no lead weights could be placed on the dirigible to stop it from shifting because it was a serious threat to pedestrians below. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that prevented them from becoming a big landing spot for dirigibles."	4	4		4

Next was the alterations made to the building, the building wasnt strong enough to hold the dirigible @CAPS1 they make @MONEY1 worth of changes. They finally realized this was an unsafe idea, and it wouldnt be good with the highly flamable hielium, @CAPS1 they were back to square 1. Then the government gave them a law that said no airships flying to low at or over urban areas, wich would make it illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the empire state building. And the top floors were turned into soda fountain."	3	3		3																					
15669	6	"Based on the excerpt, some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced on letting things dock there was the law against air ships, safety and nature. There was a law that said that air craft's weren't allowed to fly that low. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" Also it was unsafe due to the hydrogen in the dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.""

Another obstacle was whether. The winds on top of the building were always shifting because of the violent air currents. For example, U.S. Navy dirigible, Los Angeles couldn't tie up to the mast because of the wind, which might have resulted in a puncture in the shell of the dirigible. One more obstacle was the law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas. According to the passage ""This law would make it illegal to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area""...

It could not be dropped on, so sixty thousand dollars worth of maintenance had to be done to the frame. A third problem they had was tying up the dirigibles, violent winds could turn the Blimp around, possibly puncturing it.

(Lüsted, paragraph @NUM1) It was reported that the winds on top of the building were constantly changing because of violent air currents. A dirigible on the building would not be able to land properly or be weighted down with lead weights like those in open landing fields. It would not be practical to dangle weight over the heads of hundreds of people walking in the streets below. In addition to nature itself, safety was another great obstacle that the builders were faced with. It is written that, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (Lüsted, paragraph @NUM2). Since hydrogen is highly flammable, an accident could be extreme in a densely populated area like downtown New York where the Empire State Building was located.

Even if they were able to tie the front of the dirigibles to the building the cable that is holding it will cause pressure to the building. They only way you could have the building not have pressure on it was to modify the building so it can get stronger that would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Even if they were able to get around all these obstacles there is a law against airships flying to low over the city. So either way it would not have been able to happen."	3	3		3																					
15696	6	"In the making of the Empire Building the builders faced some problems. All of these problems or negative for what they actually wanted to do. Some of these problems were because of what the balloon was made of. Most balloons used hydrogen instead of helium. In the excerpt they say ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" which could cause many deaths. Also another was strong winds that could carry the balloon and be hard to handle. Last situation would be that there is a law about low-flying vehicles and the balloon flys low. In conclusion the problems they had could not be fixed, so the plan was ruined."	2	2		2																					
15698	6	"When Al Smith wanted to make a dock on the Empire State Building he wasnt really thinking straight. That was a horrible idea. Passengers would risk their lifes going on and off the dirigibles. He probably wasnt thinking about safety things and just was going for looks. The obstacles he would encounter words death from idiots that would go up there, weather, and @CAPS1. The weather was a huge factor because if it were to be windy it could through the dirigibles to go off course and crash. The @CAPS1 to make this landing pad would be crazy too because they would have to buy all the floats and make a landing station. @ORGANIZATION2 wasnt in a smart guy for letting dirigibles for landing."	2	1		2

15707	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was that it was very dangerous to have a hydrogen (highly flammable) filled dirigible dock over one of the most densely populated areas at the time. They could not let the accident that had happened in Lakehurst, New Jersey happen in New York: ""..., The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The greatest obstacle was due to natural causes: ""The winds on top of the building were consular shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigible would not be able to stay steady for docking or unloading. Other ideas to solve this problem like weights were, ""neither practical or safe."" The final obtacle was the law. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". As shown, It was simply impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building because of natural causes, danger, and the law itself."	3	4		4

Another obstacle that arose was nature, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would sway violently with the wind. Other dirigibles moored in open fields added lead wights on the back of them so they could not move. But there is no where for those weights to be attached to at the top of the Empire State Building. A practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

15731	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles docked there. Based on excerpt, one of these obstacles were the lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. If they got close enough to tie up, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers because of the fear that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigibles shell.

Famous and important dirigibles had lots of trouble with their landing like for example on December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mask but could not get close enough because of forceful winds. The dirigible could move uncontrolably and crash into the Sharp Spires on other buildings around it.

Another obstacle they faced, was that ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another main obstacle that the builders faced was that ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.""

Before they made the changes, they also realized that it was extremely windy up there, ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1, it would be safe to be up there, never knowing how bad the winds would be. So they decided to make the building shorter. After all the work they put in, it still wasn't good enough because there was a law that was ""against airships flying to low over urban areas"".

15778	6	There are some obstacles the builders face during this time while building the Empire State Building. One of the issues was the unsolved problems of mooring airships to fix a mast at a height desirable to postpone installation to a later date.

And another obstactle was the lack of a suitable landing area.	1	1		1

If an accident would occur above a densely populated area, such as New York, it would be catastrophic. Another obsticle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.

15780	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles such as weather, chemistry, and construction issues in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the height of the building meant that, ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Due to the violent wind currents, the backs of the dirigibles would constantly orbit around the mast. Another problem that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the gases that most dirigibles were made of. Most of the dirigibles from outside the country were made out of the gas hydrogen: an incredibly flammable gas. This problem was exhibited by the German dirigible Hindenburg that was destroyed by a fire. With this misfortune, the owners of the Empire State building noticed ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as a downtown New York"". With this realization, the builders of the Empire State Building finally came to realize that a dirigible dangling high above the street was not safe or a practical idea. Lastly, the construction of the building itself posed a problem the obstacles of the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would put stress upon the frame of the building and would be incredibly expensive to modify. However, the builders fixed this problem at the cost of sixty thousand dollars. Unfortunately, the other problems with the construction were too great."	4	4		4																					
15781	6	"Complex. A building is a complex structure that cannot be easily tampered with, and still be considered safe. That is the major problem the builders had. It isn't easy you ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). They had to strengthen the structure and that took ""sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" (¶ @NUM1). Plus the builders had to design a nice plan for the mast, to make it look nice. They even had to use glass which is a harder material to work with. Although the greatest obstacle the builders had was allowing the dirigible to dock. One it was filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable, and if it ever blew up it would have killed a lot of people in the city. However ""the greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (¶@NUM3). This was mentioned in @CAPS1 @NUM3 and is the main reason why the idea failed. The winds were always constantly shifting, which caused the back to swivel and become unsafe. Weights on the back would have made it even more dangerous, because they could fall. Lastly laws prevented flight so close to the ground. But even so many other blimps tried, like ""Columbia"" and ""Los Angeles"", and found it was too hard to fly that close to building and dock as well. The idea had many holes in it.

The builders were also breaking The Law because there is a law saying how low an airship can fly over an urban area, the dirigibles would be way too low.

Plus when you attempt this you are above crowded New York streets. If there was ever a malfunction or error while docking then thousands of people may lose their lives. Its much easier lending dirigibles in an open field than in mid-air because you have much more room, your planting the dirigible on secure ground, and you can weigh it down so it doesnt move around.

The @ORGANIZATION1 had to take tours of the equipment and mooring operations. The safety of the passengers of the derigible was very important and a huge obstacle for the construction of the Empire State Building. Two floors would be designated to passengers.

This pressure, and the wind pressure, would be ""transmitted to the building's foundation."" The Steel frame would also need to be reinforced, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Several other problems arose due to pedestrian safety issues: most foreign dirigibles used highly-flammable hydrogen fuel instead of helium. Everyone involved in the project realized that should the hydrogen cause a fire, the many people living in downtown New York could lose there lives @CAPS2 the dirigible would be dangling 1,250 feet over crowded @CAPS3, endangering countless pedestrians. @CAPS2 there was a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Although the Empire State Building never got to fulfill it's purpose, it is an international landmark in the heart of New York."	3	3		3																					
15898	6	"In their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building the builders ran into obstacles that in the end prevented the whole idea from moving on. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM1 line @NUM2) because of the changing winds atop the building there would be no safe way to moor a, lighter then air, dirigible on top of a high building. The wind also posed another problem because if the captin let go of the controls the dirigible might spear itself atop another pointy sparer, thus leading to the other high buildings to be an obstacle. The Law of the day also became an obstacle ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"" (@NUM3 line 1) the building itself was high up but even at the top it wasn't legal for any airship to moor due to hieght restrictions. These attempts at building a mooring dock atop the Empire State building would have sent to New York spirling up ward to being in the land inovation but the obsticles were to great to surpass."	3	3		3																					
15903	6	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders went through many obstacles. Dirigibles are steel frames balloons, with envelopes or cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Dirigibles could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rodders and passengers could ride in the gondola, under the balloon.A dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. Also the law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."	2	3		3																					
15910	6	"In attempting to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building the builders faced many problems. The first problem was the fact that most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. The problem with hydrogen is that it is highly flamable and would be a huge risk to have a hydrogen dirigible over a city full of pedestrians because it could catch on fire and hurt them.Secondly, the wins at the height of the Empire State Building were always shifting which presented great risk to pilots. If their dirigible got blown off course it could collide with other tall buildings in the city. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles got blown off course by the strong winds and the pilot could not take his hands off the controls in fear of hitting other buildings.Lastly, there was a pre-existing law that would have made it illegal for a dirigible to have entered the airspace around the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
15925	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  First, there was the problem of having a large dirigible moored to the top of the building help by a single cable tether which would add stress to the frame of the building, all the way to its foundation.  To fix this, the frame of the Empire state building would need to be strengthened.  Another problem was the safety of the citizens on the streets below.  Dirigibles using hydrogen could burst into flames.  Also high winds would make it hard for the dirigible to tether to the mooring mast.  The dirigible could not be weighed down since the weights would dangle over pedestrians on the streets.  The effectiveness of these winds was shown when the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempted to dock.  During this attempt the winds were very strong and the captain of the dirigible feared that it could be punctured by other buildings sharp spires.  Those are several examples of what builders of the Empire State building had to face."	3	3		3																					
15935	6	"One problem that the builders has was that they had to make the mast big enough. Some dirigibles would be @NUM1 feet long. If the just dropped a mast on top of the Empire State Building becaus the stress of a thousand-foot dirigible held to the Empire State Building by just one cable tether, there would be a lot of stress put on the building's frame. If they did the weight of the dirigible and the wind all of that stress and pressure would be put on the buildings foundation that was nearly eleven hundred feet below which was not safe at all. They had to go through all of the different possibilities and they also had to make sure that it was going to be safe. While designing the mast they had to consider the winds at the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. If they did design a good mast the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians, which was not safe."	3	3		3																					
15940	6	"When Al Smith first had his idea to build a mast on which to dock dirigibles, it started out as friendly competition. However, nobody predicted the obstacles that would be encountered while trying to execute the plan. One of these obstacles was simply that it was unsafe. Dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flammable. If there was an accident the results would be devastating in places populated as New York City. Another obstacle was the wind. The wind currents at the top of the building shifted constantly, making the dirigible swing from side to side, which was dangerous for passengers. One more obstacle was the fact that there was a law that prohibited airships from flying below a certain height in cities. Clearly, many obstacles were encountered, and the mast never ended up serving its intended purpose."	3	3		3																					
15941	6	"Based on the excerpt, obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the mooring mast, and rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architect designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."	1	1		1																					
15947	6	"Base on the excerpt the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They not going to do it because it might hit other building or fly into other self. ""Could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1 lines @NUM2). That mean it wasn't safe."	1	1		1																					
15955	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One was the architects couldn't drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. The thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The second problem was the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. The third problem was the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. It was over sixty thousand dollars worth to make the buildings framework. But unfortunately all the problems were unsolved and the height made it desirable to postpon to a later date but instead of becoming the transportation of the future, they had been given away to airplanes."	3	2		3																					
15956	6	"When the architects first looked at creating a safe landing zone for the dirigibles they over looked several key factors. The Empire State building is over @NUM1 feet tall, at those heights the winds become very powerful and would blow the diridible all over the place. This was proved in paragraph @NUM2. The Goodyear blimp called the ""Columbia"" attempted to reach the mooring mast although they had a skillful pilot he could not get the Steel framed balloon close enough to dock on the Spire. Another factor the architects did not weigh in to the equation was that most diridibles were filled with hydrogen which is very flammable. If a zeppelin did catch on Fire then that would be on massive ball of fire coming down on the streets of downtown New York. The ""Hindenburg"" gave us the example which was all we needed to see to change our mind about wanting a massive flammable balloon hoovering over the streets of New York City."	2	3		3																					
15960	6	"Based on the excerpt, I dont think they should have attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. According to the excerpt, I think this because something really bad could of happened and something probably has happend, But back then they really had no choice except for balloons."	0	0		0																					
15967	6	"The builders faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the biggest and hard obstacle to over come is saftey for everyone. The builders had to worry about the safty of the people coming in and out of the dirigible, the people on the near by streets and to the people in the side of the building. Saftey was one of the main reasons why the dock never was completed.Another huge obstacle that faced the builders was nature. This is true because winds at the top of the tall buildings were always changing and this would make it hard to land the dirigible on it. Like the excerpt states in paragraph @NUM1, Dirigibles were weighted down in the back by lead weights and this would cause a problem with pedestrians walking under in the streets."	2	3		2																					
15970	6	"The builders of the Empire state building encountered many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there. A main concern was safety, after Hindenburg, a German dirigible, was destroyed by fire over New Jersey. This prompted the realization that had such a disaster occurred over New York, a highly populated urban area, it could have been far worse. Another obstacle that was encountered was bad weather conditions. The winds on the top of the Empire State Building were consistently shifting, making it impossible for a dirigible to stay unmoving. If the dirigible was so unsteady, it would be very unsafe for it to be floating above millions of people. Lastly, it was illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the mast or even approach the area due to a law that prevented all airships from flying too low over urban areas. Due to all the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, it is apparent that dirigibles were simply not meant to dock there."	3	4		4																					
15973	6	The problems that the workers had to face in letting the dirigibles dock at the empire state Building were crusal & @CAPS1 Because first if they would of tried to Put Mooring Mast on the top of the Building Roof And then have A thousand pound Dirigible on top of It holdn @CAPS2 would be to Much for it to hold. And the stress of the dirigible's weight and wind pressure will need to be transmitted to the Buildings foundation which was 11 hundred feet Below The frame of the Building would have to be stronger Modified @CAPS3 it could work But it would be Over @MONEY1 to Put into the Building frame work in order for it to succeed But the Most Reason why it was difficult for the workers is Because of the winds And if landed they would need weights to weigh it down but it would be dangling high above Pedestrians witch wasn't Practical or Safe.	2	3		3																					
15974	6	"While building the Empire State Building many obstacles had occurred. During the process of planning the @CAPS1 of the building architects started to realize that there could be many complications.Several complicostions occurred during the process. Architects noticed that the building itself was not made to add additional parts. As an architect said ""it could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" Wind was another harsh factor for the construction of the Empire State Building itself. If ""held by a single cable tether, it would add Stress to the buildings frame. The engineers will also muched with the building's issues."" the Steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.Safety and nature also had a big play in the obstacles of the building of the Empire State Building. Architects planned out to maintain the dirigibles very high up. wanting to do this could be very dangerous. ""dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical or safe. Building the dirigible would have caused many accidents, injuries, and deaths if made. Nature would also be inroled in this plan. ""open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights. If anyday had very fierce winds this object could have came down and caused serious danger."	2	3		3																					
15976	6	"In the excerpt of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders went through many obstacles in the attempt to allow dringibles dock on the Empire State Building. At first Al Smith wanted this newly designed building to be the tallest one in the world. Now this 1,250 foot building would reach new heights by adding a top hat to the building and allowing drigible to dock there. Passengers to get off and on the blimp, along with the conductor refuling its engine. Although this was a great idea there were many issues that the constructor did not see, This is because the thousand foot dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame. The wind would also add thousands of dollars in damage, to ensure that no damage or harm would be put on the building or residents of New York the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be strengthened. This cost the city of New York over @MONEY1 in the hopes of putting it on the map for modern travel."	2	2		2																					
15988	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The man who came up with the plan was Al Smith, who saw the opportunity to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. Which this would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on or off. But with this came lots of work. And they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building. The architects had to make plans on how they were going to set up the mooring mast. In the story it says ""Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows."""	1	1		1																					
16002	6	The obstacles the buliders had to go through was preety hard. It was hard because the building was so high up in the air. They needed special gear to do it. Al Smith had to wait for an answer before building the mast because it was dangerous. Over sixty thousand dollars had to be made to the building framwork. The other obsticals were to drop and let passengers on. Also to refull your dirigibles if you had one. And it was just to make the building bigger.	1	2		2																					
16003	6	"The builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock. The first was that they couldn't just put the mast on top of the building, it would have put too much stress on the buildings frame. They had to transmite the stress all the way down to the foundation of the building. They did over @MONEY1 worth of framework to the building.Their next obstacle was to find a safe way to dock and unload the ships, which was impossible. First off the ship couldn't even reach the building because the violent ever-changing winds were too much to control the ship in. But even if they did dock the back of the ship would have been pushed around and around the mast.Another obstacle was a law that prevented airships from flying that low over urban areas. So now the ships couldn't ever approach the building to tie off to the mast."	4	4		4																					
16004	6	"Although the problems with docking a dirigible were not considered in the beginning, the builders of the Empire State building faced these obstacles eventually. Their ""greatest reason was one of safety"" for the passengers and pedestrians below in the city. Many countries ""used hydrogen rather than helium"" in their dirigibles, and ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" which could have caused several problems in the future. A German dirigible called Hindenburg was destroyed in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 because of fire, and it was after that incident that the owners of the Empire State building realized that an accident like that could not take place ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" because too many people could be injured. Even though safety was a large problem, ""the greatest obstacle... was nature itself."" when a dirigible was ""tethered to the mooring mast,"" the violent air currents at the top of the building would cause the ""back of the ship [to] swivel around and around."" The air currents not only made it hard to hold the dirigible steady, it made it extremely challenging to even reach the mooring mast. The idea of using lead weights to hold down the end of the blimps was not used because dangleing weights above @CAPS2 ""was neither practical nor safe."" one last obstacles the builders faced was the existing ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law prevented any dirigibles from being tied to or even approach the building. However, two blimbs (Los Angeles from U.S. Navy and the @LOCATION4 from Goodyear) did try to reach the building but were stopped due to the wind speeds. The several obstacles that presented themselves to the builders of the Empire State Building prevented the mooring mast from being used for the future of transportation."	4	4		4																					
16005	6	"In the @CAPS1 The @CAPS2 Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. The largest obstacle they faced was safety, most dirigibles who were comming from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. Another obstacle was just nature itself. Winds were constantly shiffting caused by violent air currents. Another obstacle was there was a law against airships flying to low over urban areas.

16034	6	"There were many obstacles that got in the way of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building. Most of these had to do with the framework of the building and safety. Workers encountered obstacles with the new plan of mooring blimps even before they started constructing. To be able to support the air crafts, the frame of the building would have to be ""modified and strengthened,"" or else there was no way the building would stay standing. Safety was the main issue with fulfilling the plan to moor blimps to the Empire State Building. After everything was built and finished, it was soon realized that the ""mooring mast was destined to never fulfill its purpose"". Some reasons for this were because foreign dirigibles were made mostly of hydrogen, which is highly flammable and extremely unsafe. Also, just attaching a dirigible to the mast would be dangerous due to winds that were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Not only was unsafe to moor dirigibles to the tallest building in the world, but it was also illegal. Airships were not allowed to fly to low over populated areas. After the construction of the mooring mast, it was soon realized that would never be used."	3	3		3

This became an obstacle because the building had already been built, so they'd have to work around the existing foundation. Another obstacle that was faced was a law.

Finally the greatest obstacle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""

16074	6	"Based on the excerpt given, the idea for allowing dirigibles to land on a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building in New York City was not practical. One obstacle that proves this point is that most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen a highly flamable gas rather than helium like a balloon. This raises safety issues for the urban city. Another obstacle that prevented this idea from being practical was that certain laws were passed stating that dirigibles and airships could only fly so low over urban areas due to violent winds and the risk of destruction. The mooring mast was and isn't practical for the landing of airships and is mainly useful for tourist attraction."	3	2		3																					
16075	6	"The architects of the Empire State building faced several obstacles when constructing the mooring mast. One of which would be that the purpose which it was suppose to serve (docking dirigibles), the original design of the building could not handle it. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""A thousand foot dirigibles would add stress to the buildings frame."" Because of this realization, they had to make ""sixty-thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1)Another obstacle they would have to face would be the additions of new floors. They originlly designed the building to be about @NUM3 floors, but with the addition of the mooring mast, the builders had to make an extra top and do it with such detail so that it could be both an observatory and a boarding dock.These first two obstacles, although they were difficult, nevertheless they were solvable. Some of the obstacles the builders had to face were not fixable. The first was that dirigible's from @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen (which is highly flamable). Due to the location of the Empire State building (downtown New York), a little accident could cause huge problems in the city. Also, thwy did not take in consideration the winds at the top of the building. The Empire State building would be at such a high altitude that there would be very high winds. These winds would cause for the dirigibles to be unstable which was also not safe. With these last two obstacles, the mooring mast was still built, but served as a design instead of a dock."	3	3		3																					
16082	6	"In the excerpt from, ""The Mooring Mast"", the author, Marcia Amidon Lüsted, explains how the spire of the Empire State Building was originally meant to be used as a mooring mast. This purpose of the spire was never to be fulfilled because of the numerous problems and obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the biggest problems that the builders faced were unpredictable and violent winds, the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, and air laws. The winds posed to be a problem because even though the front of the dirigible would be tethered to the mast belonged back side would be allowed to swing freely in the wind which could cause it to crash into another moored dirigible. The winds also would make just getting to the Empire a hazardous job. The use of hydrogen was a problem because hydrogen is a volatile gas in the sense that it explodes, which would be very dangerous over a densely populated area. Lastly, the air laws were a problem because the United States has a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas, which would make a mooring at the Empire State Building illegal."	4	3		4																					
16085	6	"Without a doubt, the builders of the mooring mast that was to rest at the top of the Empire State Building were highly innovative and ambitious. However, it is also clear that they faced many difficulties that they both overcame and were overcome by. One major difficulty that they faced was that a one thousand foot long dirigible being tethered to a 1,250 foot tall building with extreme wind currents around the top would put a great deal of stress onto the building, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" @CAPS1, the builders were over to overcome this problem. After the building however, the mooring mast was not able to be used for it's full purpose because of more challenges that it faced. After the tragic accident with the Hindenburg, ""the owners realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a density populated area such as downtown New York."" Another concern was that with such strong winds and only being able to tie the front of the dirigible to the moor, the back would swing around. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" The final challenge facing the mooring mast was the prexisting law against low-flying aircraft. This put an end to Al Smith's dreams."	4	4		4																					
16095	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main concern was the dirigibles themselves because they use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above a densely populated area it would be desasterous. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the building's mooring mast was nature. A mooring mast is used for docking airships such as a dirigible or a zeppelin. With these large air crafts, docking them on top of a building where winds are violently shifting is very dangerous. the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, posing as a @CAPS1 threat. Dirigibles moored in open land feilds where they could be weighed down with lead weights. With a dirigible moored over the Empire State Building, it would dangle high above pedestrians, this is neither @CAPS2 nor practicle. Constructing the Empire State Building had @CAPS3 more challenges and obsticles than its architects would have hoped for."	3	3		3																					
16098	6	"The obstacles that the builders faced are flying blimps too low in the area and making the Empire State building taller than its actually supposed to be. Like in @CAPS1 three Al Smith realized that he's in danger of losing his title for world's tallest building. On December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State building would reach a height of 1,250 ft. All he had to do is add a top or a hat to the building and that would make it even taller than any other building in the city. Anothe obstacle they faced was a law about airships flying too low above urban areas. They made this law so no airship would ever tie up with a building. Flying too low is a huge safety hazard; it could take the lives of hundreds of people."	1	2		2																					
16100	6	"in the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted there were many obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One of the problems was that a huge dirigible held the top of the building held by a single cable would have stressed to the rest of the building. in order to make the tower half of the building more stable they would have to spend sixty thousand dollars on modifications @CAPS1 nature was a key issue the winds were unpredictable because of violent air currents and even if the dirigibles were tied to the mast, the back would swivel around @CAPS2 large dirigibles dangling above pedestrians was not safe. Another reason as to why dirigibles could not be docked at the top of the Empire State Building was because there was a law not allowing airships to fly so low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal to ever dock ships there. overall, these were some of the obstacles faced well building the Empire State Building"	3	4		4																					
16116	6	"In this excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, we learn about how the spire on top of the Empire State Building was actually meant to be a landing spot for dirigibles. However, it could never actually have a dirigible dock there, for various reasons. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to tie up at the mooring mast. First, they could not because they were mostly made of hydrogen, which is very flammable. This is an especially big problem since the dirigible would possibly catch fire about New York City. Next, there was the problem of winds. The wind at the top of the mast is extremely violent and the back of the dirigible would constantly be swinging around. Using lead weights to hold it down were a possibility, ""but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The last problem, and possibly the most obvious, is that there was a law that prohibited airships, like dirigibles, from flying too low over densely populated areas. Therefore, this ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS1 this excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, though they should've seen them coming, in trying to get dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast."	3	4		4																					
16118	6	"The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, talks about the height of the buildings, the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. The architecture who built the Chrysler Building was secretly hiding something. The secret was that he constructed a 185-foot spire inside the building, it shocked many people and the media by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler Building. Now it's a height of 1,046 feet, which is 46 feet taller than the height of the Empire State Building. One obstacle to their expand use in New York city was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith thought that a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service to let passengers on and off. The mooring mast couldn't just simply drop a mooring mast on top or the building. Adding a mooring mast to a cable tether could add stress to the buildings frame. They finally build the mooring mast and they raised the American flag again."	1	2		2																					
16119	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was an issue for the builders. The dirigibles made outside of the United States were used with hydrogen. This became a safety issue because ""hydrogen is highly flammable"". On top of the building, the wind is always shifting because of ""violent air currents"". The shifting winds would be a problem because they would cause the end of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem the builders faced was the ""law against airships flying too low of urban areas""; making it illegal to dock the dirigibles. The builders also feared that the high winds could ""blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area"", causing danger to the city. There are many obstacles the builders faced that made it impossible for the dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building."	4	3		4																					
16121	6	"Allowing dirigibles to dock to the Empire State Building was never a safe idea. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" @CAPS1 obstacles arose once the idea got thrown around.Builders soon realized that docking the dirigibles to the Empire State Building would cause stress to the building; ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Safety was a major obstacle because dirigibles from outside the @PERSON1 used hydrogen that was highly flammable. Then the obstacle of wind came and played. Usually they would weigh them down but that was not ideal being so close to other buildings and hovering over thousands of people. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The idea was never successful due to the obstacles presented."	3	2		3																					
16124	6	"Al Smith's plan to add two hundred and fifty feet of height onto the Empire State Building by attaching a resting stop for traveling blimps was plaussible in theory, but as it was put in motion the workers had to face multiple obstacles that ultimately made the attempt unsuccessful. The easiest and the only fixable obstacle was the issue of the added stress the blimp put on the building's frame. The whole building had to be strengthed to adjust to the pressure, but the workers eventually got the construction done. However, the biggest thing that hindered the mooring mast from being successful was nature itself. The winds that high in the air were constantly shifting violently, so even if the dirigible had been attached to the mast, the back of it would swivel around uncontrollably. Unfortunately because they would have landed high in the air, using lead weights the control the back of the aircraft was impractical. The prevention of natures problems is not possible, and similarly nothing could have been done to fix the issue of unsafety. Most blimps outside of the @LOCATION2 used a more flammable gas inside of them, and landing a dirigible that could catch on fire high above New York City was an extremely dangerous idea. There was nothing the workers could have done to solve other countrie's blimp composition. Finally, if nothing else, there were solid laws that made it illegal to ever have anything tied up so low over and urban area. Obviously, this obstacle couldn't have been overcome without waiting years and a lot of legal business. Placing the mooring mast on the Empire State Building with hope to land dirigibles seemed good, but during the actual process many obstacles were presented, most of which had no solution. In the end, the hope to ""equipp [the building] for an age of transportation,"" had to be given up."	4	4		4																					
16135	6	The obstacles the builders had to face were very big obstacles. One of them being the Mooring Mast it's self. The building which wasn't strong enough to hold an airship with it's original design. So the building had to be Modified and Strengthened to accommodate this situation. They would add a rocket shaped tower built out shiny glass and chrome-nickel Stainless steel. This tower would illuminate from the inside. Which would bump the building from @NUM1 floors to 102 floors . I got all this information from paragraphs @NUM2.	1	2		2																					
16136	6	"Based on the excerpt some obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the laws @CAPS1 plane height, the fact that some dirigibles used hydrogen fuel instead of helium, and lastly at such great heights the strong wind currents were a problem as well. The restriction of plane height was that plaes could not fly to low above cities without being a safety hazard. ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". (The MOORING MAST). Another obstacle related to the fact that some outside the U.S dirigibles used hydrogen fuel in place of helium which could cause a problem because hydrogen is highly flammable. ""From outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"". (The Mooring Mast). Lastly, strong winds were an obstacle as well, the high wind currents would blow the dirigibles all around as the attempted to dock at the Empire State Building which would pose as a problem. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". (The Mooring Mast). In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	4		4																					
16143	6	"Despite the pricey investments of sixty thousand dollars that needed to be put into the building for this project to become a reality, there were many more obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obstacle they faced was the safety of people; a dirigibles dangleing nearly @NUM1 feet above ground with the possibility of explosion and pedestrians below doesn't seem like the smartest idea. Another problem they faced was the stress that the dirigible-held on by only a single cable-would put on the buildings frame. With the wind blowing the dirigible around the load and pressure of it would have to be sent all the way to the base of the building about @NUM1 feet down. In order for this to work the builders would have to strengthen the steel frame of the building. Maybe the most difficult obstacle they faced was nature itself, strong wind streams above the building would have caused the dirigible to swing around once it was docked, as well as running the risk of being blown of course and into another building. And if they ever wanted this idea to work in the first place they should have checked the laws first; aircrafts were not allowed to fly that low over urban areas. Builders of this landing dock and the empire state building just faced too many obstacles."	4	3		4																					
16150	6	"Trying to construct the Empire State Building in a way to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the building, brought up many challenges for the builders. There was a huge saftey issue having the blimps so close to the city. In paragraph @NUM1, the fear of winds that could blow the blimp into other buildings, wrecking them, scared people. The second concern was the fact that the blimp is full of highly flamable gas and if they blimp was ever to burst into flames above a city, much damage would be done to the blimp and New York City. The last major concern is located in paragraph nine. The problem would be the amount of stress the building would take on by having a blimp tied to the top of it. The whole building would have to be reconstructed to help the Empire State Building not take on that stress; In fact, basically every part of the building and blimp would have to be remodeled in order to keep New York City, and the passengers of the dirigible safe."	3	3		3																					
16153	6	"As it was the idea of a dirigibles dock was quite far fetched THe first problem thay encountered was that having a thousand foot long dirigible attached to the empire state building would cause a great strain on the buildings framework, @CAPS1 they would have to change the structure of the entire building to strengthen its framework. The largest problem was a matter of safety. Dirigibles use hydrogen which is extremely flammable, also the author states ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" making the idea of a dirigibles dock extremly to risky. They should have been spotted before so much money was put into making this dock."	3	3		3																					
16159	6	"There were obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the many obstacles the dirigibles had to face was the lack of a suitable landing area, which I found on paragraph six. Another obstacle would be on paragraph @NUM1 where it says ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Nature itself would be another obstacle for the dirigibles, because ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1 but not least, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Which means it is illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even go near the area. In conclusion these were some out of the many obstacles a dirigible had to face."	4	3		4																					
16172	6	"The mooring mast seems like a great idea. A landing dock for dirigibles would have jumped travel into the future. As it turns out, however, architect Al Smith bit off more than he could chew. First of all, the fate of the Hindenburg put worry over the owners heads. ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that (Hindenburg) accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". The second problem is that there is an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""This law would make it illegal for the ship to tie up to the building or even approch the area"", The final and most problematic part of the mooring mast was actually revealed to be nature itself. As it turns out, the wind on top of the building were too violent and unpredictable. Even if the dirigible was tethered, ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". Overall, it seems like this was a great idea gone bad."	3	3		3																					
16174	6	"There were multiple obstacles that made the idea of docking dirigibles foolhardy from the start. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) the idea of such a volatile object over the population became far more of a threat than a luxury. Lead weights needed to support the craft could not be supplied, and would also prove to be hazardous. Given the Empire State Building's nature, the modifications became hasselsome and added unnecessary difficulty. The winds at that altitude would also provide docking issues and instability. Finally, the airplane overtook the blimp, because it could travel faster and hold the same, if not more, number of people in a small area. Blimps became dangerous and cumbersome, and would not benefit New York as Al Smith had hoped."	2	2		2																					
16176	6	"The Empire State Building was built with great potential, but it would never reach it fully. The Empire State Building was supposed to reach @NUM1 feet, being just inches taller than the Chrysler Building, when the architect who designed the @CAPS1 Building snuck up and stuck a 46 foot pole on top. Of course the Empire State Building had to be taller, so they set a new goal and reached 1,250 feet on December 11, 1929. Al Smith, @CAPS2 of New York and Architect, decided that the Empire State Building needed a cherry on top, so he decided to put a mooring mast for zeppelins on top. This plan was destined for disaster: the foundation wasn't stable enough for zeppelins, they could easily be blown out of control and onto the sharp tip of the Building, and also, since  zeppelins had hydrogen in them, they could explode and fall onto the densely populated @LOCATION1. All in all, the mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building was built for disaster"	2	2		2																					
16178	6	"It is clear that there were problems in trying to dock dirigibles on the Empire state Building. The first reason's that, the law against flying airships to low over the Empire State Building made it hard to do so. Next is that the thoughtes in being unsafe because some dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is flammable A big reason is when the german dirigible got destryed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building then realized how much more worse the accident could have been if it had happened on such a densely populated area suched as downtown New York City. The last reason was the thought that they would use lead weights to hold the dirigibles down, but they realized that it wasn't practical nor was it safe. It was clear that there were problems in the docking of dirigibles on the Empire State building; but it is probably a much safer choice for both the residents/citizens of New York and all of the people who ever work(ed) on it such as architects, engineers and the aviation pioners."	3	3		3

16189	6	"As a result of the idea to build a mooring mast, the builder faced a few obstacles in construction the mast. The first problem was structural, the weight of the dirigible tied it with a single tie would put great stress on the building. It was said between the dirigible's load and wind pressure the stress would be distributed all the way to foundation of the building. Another obstacle was the safety. Many dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen instead of Helium which is highly flamable. The owners realized the ""Hindenburg"" incident and realized the effects it could of had on downtown New York. The final obstacle was nature because the winds shifted at the top of the building. The problem discussed on this was despite the dirigibles being tied, it could swivel around the mast. The many obstacles faced led to the mooring mast not being constructed to its full purpose and blimps were less commodly used."	3	3		3																					
16193	6	"During any type of construction, the builders face some type of obstacles, as do the builders of the Empire State Building. One obstacle the builders faced in attempting to let dirigibles dock on the Empire State building is the high flammability they have. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey and if this would have happened in New York, with a more densely populated area, the accident would have been much worse. Another obstacle they faced, their greatest obstacle, was the power of nature. Air currents were violent, so the winds were constantly shifting and this would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast, even if it was tethered to it. One last obstacle they faced was an existing law that prevented airships to fly too low over urban areas, like New York. Seeing the obstacles they faced, the builders realized that being able to moor a dirigible to the mast on top of the Empire State Building just was not meant to be."	3	3		3																					
16204	6	The builders faced some problems such as weather conditions. The winds were violent from changing wind currents. Another was the law of how close an aircraft could be to a building. Another problem was the building had to be strong enough to hold a blimp in place. The builders would have to strengthen the buildings skeleton in order for it to work. This they did. Another problem is some foreign Blimps are made with hydrogen. This makes them highly flamable. With others made of helium. The hydrogen could catch fire and fall onto pedestrians. These are the problems they faced.	3	2		3

Another dangerous aspect is that this huge piece of material would be dangling high above pedestrians, as opposed to there much safer usual landing of open fields.

After the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire, builders realized how bad the devastation would be if that happened over densely populated New York City. Nature was also a large obstacle. Shifting air currents at the top of the building would make the dirigible very unstable. It would be dangerous to have an unstable dirigible hanging above crowded city streets.

The owners of the Empire State Building realized that a much worse situation would happen it were to catch on fire ""above a densely populated area"" (@NUM1).

To prevent this from happening the Government had already made a law that banned flying aircraft from going to close to urban areas. To build this @CAPS1 the architects would have to break laws or bend rules. Another conflicting idea, that disrupted, plans for a dirigble docking station would be nature, harsh winds could easily sway a blimp, and swaying could cause the blimp to punture on a nearby building, ""Even if the dirigble were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would still swivel around the mooring mast.""

16257	6	"Despite all hope and anticipation surrounding the construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, the project was never destined to be a success. In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there are many obstacles described that the builders faced as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. The first major obstacle that the builders came upon was that when a dirigible was mounted onto the mooring ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". This obstacle caused the need for an abundance of extra support on the frame needed to maintain sturdiness of the building. The other, and arguably greatest obstacle that the builders faced were the rapid wind currents that surrounded the building. The winds caused problems for the dirigible because ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". This caused a major design flaw for the builders in the way that they would have to maintain control and safety of the dirigible as it was docked by the mooring. As much as the plan dwarfed others of its time, it was short-lived. The plan had far too many obstacles to overcome and serves better today as a memorable characteristic of the Empire State building."	3	3		3

To fix this problem, the ""frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" Another obstacle faced by the builders involved nature. The winds on top of the building were violent and often shifted directions. This hindered the ability of a dirigible to moor on top of the building and remained a problem. The final obstacle faced was a restriction on the flight of airships over urban areas. This restriction made it impossible for dirigibles to moor on top of the Empire State Building.

16330	6	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, obstacles builders faced building a mast for dirigibles to dock there are detailed One obstacle builders faced was how to go about attaching it. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" Another obstacle would be the accumulated cost of the renevisions due to the first problem. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frame work."" These obstacles prevented the mast for ever being used its intended purpose."	2	2		2																					
16333	6	"Many obstacles faced the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempts to dock dirigibles or zeppelins. First and foremost, a mooring mast would have to be added to the building. However, according to @ORGANIZATION2, ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" before a dirigible could be moored to the mast. Secondly, outside of the United States, most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen gas, rather than helium, as shown in @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1. The owners realized that it would be quite dangerous to have a dirigible moored over downtown New York, after the German ""Hindenburg"" ""was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION1."" (@ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1). In accordance with @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM3, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Violent winds, caused by air currents at the top of the building would cause a moored dirigible to swivel, and using lead weights to counter this would be dangerous over such a densely populated area. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los @CAPS1 could not even dock in December 1930 due to winds. Lastly, an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the mast anyway. (p @NUM4)"	4	4		4																					
16341	6	"Although the mooring mast due to hoist at the top of the Empire State Building was a well thought out plan, it provided some obstacles for builders. The biggest problem was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is a highly flammable product. If an accident, such as fire, occurred at the Empire State mooring mast it wouldn't be safe to take place around millions of people such as New York City. Another factor affecting building was nature. The winds above were constantly shifting due to currents. The only way to tie down the dirigibles would be to use weights, but that would also be extremely unsafe to be hanging above a city of people. The last issue was an existing law that prevented airships from flying to low in urban areas. This law makes it illegal for ships to even attempt to tie to the building, therefore it made it nearly impossible for builders to work."	3	3		3																					
16342	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with some big obstacles. One obstacle was they had to make sure that the Dirigibles could dock safely. They had to be sure that the passengers could get off and on safely. Lastly they had to be sure the building would not collapse when they made the mooring mast. These examples shows that the builders were faced with many obstacles when building the Empire State Building."	1	2		2																					
16343	6	"The building wasn't designed to carry the extra weight of having a dirigible attach to the top. And the dirigibles had to have weights drop from the back to keep it in place, that wouldnt be very safe have lead weights dangle over @NUM1 feet in the air. The mast was built out of Glass which could have been dangerous if a dirigible couldnt stop and went straight into the tower. Also the electronic winching stations didn't seem like they would work to well."	2	2		2

One obstacle was that a law stating that airships couldn't fly too low over cities, meaning they couldn't dock at the Empire State building. Another obstacle was that foreign blimps used hydrogen instead of helium to fly, and hydrogen is very flammable, so using hydrogen blimps in @LOCATION1 would create public safety issues. Finally, nature would prove to be the greatest obstacle because of wind, which could get quite violent and cause the blimps to possibly get untied from the building or fall.

The engineers realized from the start that even if they could get a blimp docked, it would put additional stress on the buildings structure. to fix this, they had to reinforce the entire building. In addition to this, the docking of a blimp was dangerous in itself. It could easily be destroyed like the Hindenburg"	2	2		2																					
16391	6	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the mooring mast had to face obstacles that hindered the success of the docking of the dirigibles. First, the architects had to design the mast. They knew that the frame of the Empire state building would have to be strengthened to carry the load and wind pressure of the dirigible. Therefore, they ""designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the buildings skeleton"" and planned for the reconstruction of the building and mast. Workers were excited with their plans and ready to watch the launch of a revolutionary moment. However, once they realized the many problems with their construction plan, they faced many roadblocks that prevented the plan to follow through. ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" proving that the mooring mast was unsafe and could lead to potential accidents. Also, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Showing the physical insecurity of the ship on the dirigible. Lastly, the law states restrictions on airships flying too low, and the dirigibles would be breaking that law. Even though builders wanted to provide a launching pad for the dirigibles and had an ideal design, there were too many faults that made the mooring mast impossible to bring to reality. Clearly, the builders faced many problems that could not have been solved in trying to allow the dirigibles to dock"	4	4		4																					
16398	6	"The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were severe. The greatest and most important obstacle they faced was safety. If a plan is not completely safe, it shouldn't happen. The Empire State Building would not have been stable enough with the winds being so powerful. Also, most dirigibles or blimps used hydrogen not helium which would be extremely dangerous if the blimp caught on fire. Especially in a place as crowded as New York. This was another problem with landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building.                                                                                                                                                                  Another obstacle was the wind. A dirigible could not land unless it was weighted down with lead weights which also was not a bit safe for people walking freely in New York City. These problems are the reasons why the dirigibles could not land on the Empire State Building"	3	4		4																					
16401	6	"Dirigibles had a top speed of Eighty milles per hour, and they could Cruise at Seventy milles per hoor for thousands of milles witout needing refueling. Some were as long as one thousand feet the same length as four bloks in New York City. The one obstacole to their expanded use in New York was the lak of a suitable landing area. The greatest obstacle to the sucsessful use of the mooring mast was nature it salf a window on the top were Constantly @CAPS1 due to biolent air corents."	2	2		2																					
16403	6	"In building the Empire State Building, builders had to deal with numerous obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was what the dirigibles would attach to. Builders thought that by adding a mooring mast it would make docking easy, although they disregarded the building's foundation. The builders realized that the foundation was not nearly strong enough to accommodate dirigibles, so over an additional sixty thousand dollars was spent to make it stronger. Builders then had to brainstorm how passengers would board, along with a place for baggage and ticketing. To resolve this, a glassed-in observation area and open observation platform were constructed. Another obstacle was the existing airship law for how low they could fly. The dirigibles clearly went against this law and the idea for using the mast for docking. After failed attempts at docking the idea went away, and builders realized the plan would never work."	2	3		3																					
16411	6	"The excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, after the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the fear of such an accident occurring in a densely populated areas such as New York posed a problem, because most international dirigibles used flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Another obstacle was the nature of the mooring mast, and the violent air currents that cause shifts in wind. Having a dirigible moored to the top of the Empire State Building, ""dangling high above the pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"" (paragraph @NUM1). Also, there was an existing laws that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, therefore making ""it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (paragraph @NUM2). The architects of the project were so excited by the novelty of the idea that they were blind to these potential difficulties. These obstacles and unsolved problems contributed to the unsuccess of the mass, and the idea disappeared and was forgotten"	4	3		4																					
16414	6	"The architects of the Empire State Building faced many safety & practical obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock on top of it. For example, dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen, rather than helium, gas. Hydrogen gas is highly flammable. Therefore, the German dirigible the ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by a fire in 1937. The architects of the Empire State Building foresaw that this could have been a much more tragic event if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Furthermore, anchoring a @NUM1 foot dirigible to the top of a building with a single tether would add stress to the building's frame. In order to solve this problem, the architects would have to make @MONEY1 in modifications to the building's steel frame. Additionally, there are violent & unpredictable winds above the Empire State Building. If a dirigible were tethered to the mast, it would swivel around the top of the building with the wind currents. When moored in open fields, dirigibles can be anchored with weights. However, dangling weighted anchors above the heads of pedestrians could be potentially dangerous. In 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" tried to moor the Empire State Building, but couldn't get close enough to the spire to tie itself up because of sharp winds. The pilot had to maneuver around other spires as well, for fear of puncturing the dirigible. Clearly, there were practical & safety reasons why the dirigible moor was unable to be completed at the top of the Empire State Building."	4	4		4																					
16416	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow drigibles to dock there. For one, most drigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, so it could explode. For instance, on May 6, 1937 the German drigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. There is no predicting that that could never happen again. The greatest obstacle in attempting drigibles to dock there was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents and even if it was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Drigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets wasn't practical and not safe. Another reason is because there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, due to fear over the wind, blowing the drigible in to other buildings in the area which would puncture the drigible's shell and cause a lot of damage."	3	4		4																					
16418	6	"When something is getting invented or built, many obstacles are faced. The number one obstacle was safety. The wind at the top of the empire state building was another problem. The actual building was a problem too. All these problems and the architects tried to work around them, and failed.Safety is important, if one person dies per trip nobody is going to go on the ballon. Safety is important, no safety means no bussiniss. The wind was a huge problem. If the balloon won't stay still while unloading it is very unsafe. The skeleton of the building would have to change and that is an expensive fix. These are some of the major obstacles the architects faced. Maybe one day they will fix it."	2	2		2																					
16425	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The difficulty in having stress from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure is that it would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.      Wind was another obstacle that the builders had to overcome. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. And even if the dirigible were to be tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using the led weights at the Empire State Building would not be safe, as they would dangle high above pedestrians on the street."	3	3		3																					
16433	6	"When allowing dirigibles to dock of the empire state building they were faced with many obstacles. One of the many obstacles the builders were faced with was the empire state building was not well structured to hold a dirigible of @NUM1 ft and the buildings structure would need to be modified to altleast sisty thousand dollars more. Another obstacle the builders had faced was the dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium so hydrogen was very flamable This ment they didnt want something bad to take place above the building and in a ""populated area like downtown new york"". The last main obstacle they had to face was the mooring mast was always differer by the nature around it and the dirigibles would wear on its causing danger to people in the town of new york. Those were the few obstacles the builders had on allowing drigibles to dock near the empire state building"	3	2		3																					
16434	6	The builders of the Empire State building had alot of problems in biulding the @CAPS1. How Would they be able to allow dirigables to @CAPS1 there? High Winds and laws stood in the biulders way. The fram of the building had to be renforced so it would not fall to the ground. The landing gear date had to be postponed due to building scedual's.  Whe a dirigible did try to land it couldnt. The air streems were too much for it. In the end the idea was unrealistic. High winds and laws prevented the @CAPS1 from ever being used.	2	2		2																					
16436	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire state building. @PERSON1 says in the excerpt ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This shows that in order for the dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building, there must be enough landing space. If a mooring mast was added to the top of the building it would only allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. One of the others practical reason why dirigibles could not moore at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The architects could also not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, could add stress to the building's frame. So the builders of the Empire State Building did not allow the dirigibles to dock on top of thier building. Also because of everything that could happen to the building."	2	3		2

If the builders had decided to that than the dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame which could also jeopardize the lives of all the tourists who visited and everyone who worked there.There was also the fact that ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.""

The most obvious being safety since most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.

16458	6	"In their attempts to try and build a platform for dirigibles to dock at, the builders of the Empire State Building failed to note a few difficulties. One would be the way passengers got one and off of dirigibles. While anchoring to refuel and allowing passengers to get on and off, the rear of the blimp would constantly swivel which could endanger the passengers and could possibly cause the dirigible to get damaged or destroyed. Another difficulty was the way the mast was built. It had a design similar to that of a rocket, so it was not possible for dirigibles to completely land. If it had a platform-like design, so instead of hovering dirigibles could land, which allowed for more stability."	2	1		2																					
16460	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the architects faced was the building's frame. They needed to design the landing area so that if a dirigible landed there, it wouldn't add too much stress to the building's frame. Another problem was the stress of the load, and wind pressure. In paragraph @NUM1, the author says ""The stress of dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred  feet below,"" and that is why the dirigible's load, and the wind's pressure are a significant problem. Finally, after the builders figured out that they needed to make various adjustments, also to strengthen the building's steel frame, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made,"" which is a lot of money!

They then had to accomidate with the new situation that new modifications had to be done so that the dirigible would not add stress to the buildings frame, since the steel frame of the building could not with stand the load and wind pressure that would transmitt nearly @NUM1 feet below. The biggest obstacles that led to the fate of the mast was the fact of, since most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which was very flammable, and they could not have any accidents taking place above downtown New York. Nature itself was the greatest obstacle though because, of the constant shifing winds. The dirigibles could be weighted down in the back with lead weights but with them dangling high above pedestrians on the street was not safe or practical.

It was basically a competition to see who was to have the tallest building in New York. A mooring mast was put on top of each building for more height. Although, the builders did not account the balloons, or dirigibles that pass in the air. Dirigibles are highly flammable, and if they so happen come in contact with a mooring mast, it could be destroyed, just like before, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937,""...

The weather conditions that were occurring high above of this 1,250 ft building made it difficult for dirigibles to dock themselves making the outcome unsafe. Builders also had to face the reality of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". with this law taking its action it made it illegal for a dirigible to even attempt a landing on these docks. The main concern of obstacles these builders constructing this landing dock would be the strong winds that would occur. The winds were so powerfull and strong that the blimp would face ""the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell."" This obstacle of weather was a huge struggle to these architects making the dock of these dirigibles unsuccessful. The obstacles that were faced in constructed this dock came to the outcome of dirigibles being ""given away to airplanes""."	4	3		4																					
16502	6	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were, the one obstacle to thier expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area, also saw a opportunity for his Empire State Building to have a mooring mast added to the top of the building that would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, or to let passengers off and on. Also dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. In conclusion, these are the obstacles which the builders of the Empire State Building faced, to allow dirigibles to be docked."	1	1		1																					
16507	6	"The builders of the Empire State building had to face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was placing the mooring mast on the building. Lüsted states, ""The architects could not simply place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof"" (Lüsted @NUM1). This meant that they would have to build another structure to be able to place the mooring mast. The second obstacle they faced was preparing the building to dock dirigibles. Lüsted claims, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top... held by a single tether would add stress to the buildings frame (Lüsted @NUM1). The dirigibles would weigh the building down so they would have to find a way to prevent damaging the building. The architect would have ""The steelframe modified and strengthed"" in order for any dirigible to dock there. These are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock."	3	2		3																					
16516	6	The obstacles the builders faced with the mooring mast was the winds and the gases used in non-@CAPS1 dirigibles. The wind was a problem because that high up the dirigibles' back would swivle around the mooring mast. The gases used was a problem because out of country zeppelins used hydrogen which was highly flammable which would be bad if the zeppelin went up in flames over the densely populated New York.	2	2		2

16526	6	"In the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders faced many obstacles. They were trying to get Dirigibles to land on the empire state building. They faced many problems while trying to accomplish this feat. If they were going to have Dirigibles land atop the building they would have to add floors to the building. Another one is ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation."" Which means they would have to waste even more money. Then something they found out later is they couldn't even do this, in the first place due to legal matters. If they did that then they would be getting themselves in trouble with the legal system. Once they realized that I think that they realize the project was a failure and told the world ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postone too a later date the final installation of the landing gear."""	3	3		3

16531	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to suffer through many hardships in building the Mooring mast and trying to dock Dirigibles on it. Some of the obstacles that the builders had to over come where the weather, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" (paragraph @NUM1). The winds at the top of the Empire State Building shifted a lot to do to the violent air currents, even if the Dirigible was tied to the mast the wind would push the back all the way around the mast. Another obstacle that the builders had to overcome was that they feared that the lead weights that held the Dirigible down would be dangling over the edge of the building, leaving it unsafe for pedestrians and for the pilot and passengers on the blimp."	2	2		2																					
16538	6	"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders ran into a few obstacles. One obstacle was a previously existing law about airships flying too low over urban areas like downtown New York. Another problem the builders ran into was high winds causing the back end of the dirigible to swing in the wind, making it unsafe for passengers unloading. Unlike dirigibles moored in open fields, lead weights could not be used to weigh the back of the dirigible down because they would be dangerous for pedestrians on the street. Another safety issue was most balloons outside the United States filled dirigibles with hydrogen which is much more flammable than helium. Dirigibles filled with hydrogen could cause a disaster if it ever caught on fire. Although the idea seemed great at first, the builders at the Empire State Building realized it was not practical or safe."	3	3		3																					
16540	6	"Architects constructing the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles for the mooring mast. During the 1920s dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. The idea of making a mast wasnt so farfetched at first. As construction neared completion many concerns arose. Many dirigibles outside the United States use the highly flammable gas known as hydrogen. Another problem was the docking of the blimps, winds on the Empire State Building constantly shifted which forced the rear of the dirigibles to rotate around the mooring mast. Lastly a law was formed to restrict airships from entering an urban area at low altitudes. When all the problems came together the idea of mooring dirigibles quietly disappeared."	3	2		3																					
16547	6	"Based on the excerpt, it is clear that the builders of the mooring mast atop of the Empire State Building faced multiple problems. To begin, the excerpt states that dirigibles from other countries were often filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. The danger of hydrogen was demonstrated when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames. The Hindenburg incident could have been far worse if it had happened in a densely populated area, such as New York City. Aside from the Fire @CAPS1 the mooring mast would create, there was also a ban on low flying aircraft so in densely populated areas. According to the excerpt though, the greatest obstacle was ""Nature itself."" This was a reference to the powerful winds and violent gusts found at the peak of the Empire State Building. With those winds, it would be outstandingly difficult to control a dirigible safely. After realizing all of these complications and obstacles, it was decided that the mooring mast would not be built."	3	3		3																					
16553	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles faced was making sure that the people below would not get hurt. If something happened to fall, someone could get hurt. Another obstacle faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. That's the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	1	1		1																					
16554	6	"Builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting durables be able to dock there. Some of these obstacles weren't caused by the building it self, nature took part of it due to the forceful winds at the height of 1,250 feet it was hard for the pilots of the dirigibles to steer the ship close enough to tie it up. This situation occurred to the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" fearing the wind would blow the ship onto Sharp edges or other buildings in the area. Witch would cause the shell to get punctured leading to a disaster the captain failed to attempt to reach the building on december 1930. Another obstacle builders faced was that an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas witch would put civilians on the street at risk. Another obstacle was not a large enough dirible would put stress on the buildings frame."	3	3		3

16561	6	"Obstacles are faced everyday, but the builders of the Empire State Building had even harder challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. The reasons as to why dirigible could not dock there were obvious. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, a very flammable elements, to float. If a dirigible caught fire above a densely populated area, like downtown New York, a very serious problem would develope. Another obstacle, being faced, was nature. The winds were constantly shifting because of violent air currents causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Lead weights could be used to weigh down the back of the ship, but dangeling these weights above pedestrians is very dangerous. Also, there is a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building. The idea for making a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a clever idea, but evidently it was impossible."	3	3		3																					
16562	6	"In the article "" The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted it is apparent that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges, during the attempt of trying to dock dirigibles. The dirigibles themselves could be a hazard. ""... Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. ""In likes of what had happened to the German airship Hindenburg, officials didn't want a similar disaster to occur in downtown New York. Also, the dirigibles light mass would make it a target to high, forceful winds."" The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currets."" This reality caused fear that a zeppelin could potentially be blown into a spire of some sort on another building, causing it to suffer a hole in its fragile lining. The law also caused obstacles for docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building ""... dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law thwarted many of the would-be attempts of mooring these. Mooring dirigibles was a dream talked about in, ""The Mooring Mast,"" however that soon never had the chance to come true."	4	4		4																					
16567	6	"Building just a building alone is a tremendous job for builders, then adding on a docking mast for dirigibles makes it significantly more difficult. The architects and builders had to consult with experts as to how this construction should take place and whether it was safe or not. The architects and builders had to tour equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 and also had to meet with the president of an airship transport company. Perfusive planning and many meetings later they would begin building this mooring mast.As for the building the construction workers could not just drop a mooring mast onto the flat roof of the Empire State Building they had to find another way, they did not want to put stress on the buildings frame. They came to the conclusion that the frame of the building must be modified requiring over sixty thousand dollars. Workers got to add the mast and then construction was haulted due to danger of pedestrians, all that work for nothing."	2	2		2																					
16569	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.       One obstacal the builders faced was the winds on top of the building. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even though the dirigible were tyed dow to the mass, the ship would swivle around the mooring mass. This would make it unsafe for pedestrians.       Another issue with landing the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was safety. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly Flammable. When a German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, @LOCATION3 owners of the Empire State Building relized that accident would be much worse in down town New York."	3	3		3																					
16577	6	"In the process of building the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles for the builders. Al Smith, who was the one who designed the building, wanted to make the building taller. He did this by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on a mooring mast at the top of the building, reaching 1,250 feet high. There was obstacles in the way of attaining this goal. Safety was the greatest reason why it was never used as a docking station. Hydrogen was used in the dirigibles, which was highly flammable. An accident had already occurred having to do with a dirigible, called Hindenburg, in New Jersey. As popular as New York is they couldn't take the risk of putting harmful, dangerous gases in a densely populated area. Another problem that occurred to stop this building from being used as a mooring mast was the powerful wind currents that constantly shifted. The dirigible would be dangling high over pedestrians swivelling around because of the wind, this made it very unsafe and not even practical. One last reason the Empire State Building would not be able to have a mooring mast in which dirigibles could land was because there was a law which stated airships were not allowed too low over urban areas. These were some of the obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1."	3	4		4																					
16595	6	"One of the obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was to strengthen the frame of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below (paragraph @NUM1)."" If the building was not strengthen, all that stress and force would collapse the building. Another obstacle faced to the perfection of docking dirigibles was modifying it's safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @NUM2)."" If a dirigible were to be destroyed by fire in downtown New York, I guarantee a really serious hazardous accident. Downtown New York is densely populated, a destroyed dirigible in downtown New York puts in danger the passengers of the dirigible and the pedestrians of downtown. Other than the two obstacles explained above, nature is another obstacle to the Empire State Building. Strong winds can affect the Building or even the dirigible. ""The winds on Top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph @NUM3)."" Violent winds could force the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. A swiveling ship above pedestrians is no where close to safe. The law enforces that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Flying too low over urban areas, once again, puts both pedestrians and passengers in state of danger. The dirigible could be blown by the wind and blow onto a sharp spire of other buildings in the area. These are the obstacles faced in docking a dirigible successfully."	4	4		4																					
16599	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow drigibles to dock there. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof."" That was struggle number one, a thousand-foot drigible would add too much stress to the frame. ""The stress of the drigibles load and as the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" That was another obstacle the builder's had to overcome considering the foundation was eleven hundred feet below. The Empire State building then had to be strengthened and modified in order to build a stronger foundation for the mooring of a drigible upon the Empire State Building. Those were some of the many obstacles the builder's went through in designing the mast."	3	3		3																					
16603	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. Because it was held by a Single Cable tether that would add Stress to the buildings frame. Another obstacle was that dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the Building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Even though, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and Strengthened to accommodate this new Situation. Overall, this cost over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications."	2	1		2																					
16605	6	"In the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building, builders were faced with several different obstacles. One obstacle the builders faced was how they were going to modify the building to be able to support a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" because it would add too much stress to the buildings frame. Another obsticle along with the modifications to the buildings' frame was the money. Building this new structure would cost, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"". One of the most important obsticles however was safety. Although most blimps in the united states use helium, outside countries mainly use hydrogen. Hydrogen, being highly flamable, was absolutely out of the question to be in a city as highly and densely populated as New York. The other safety hazards included the winds which were, ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" because the back of the blimp could not be weighed down and also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" which would make their attempts not only dangerous, but illegal. In the end, the mooring mast was never completed."	4	4		4																					
16611	6	"After finishing the @ORGANIZATION1, architects want to start mooring dirigibles right away. However, due to three potential problems the architect had never realized before, they never could moor any dirigibles. One problem was the most @CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. This was a problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable, ad after the Hindenburg @CAPS2 up in @ORGANIZATION2, architects feared a similar catastrophe could happen in @CAPS3, but many more would die. Another problem was high winds. Because it was so windy at the top of the building, it was almost impossible to hold the dirigibles steady. Also, the dirigible would have swiveled while tied to the building because there was nothing holding down the front and back. the third issue was that there was a law against flying dirigibles at the height that was necessary to moor on the Empire State Building. That's why no dirigibles ever successfully moored on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
16613	6	"While constructing the Empire State Building, the builders were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One such obstacle that the builders had overcome was the law that prevented airships (i.e. plains or dirigibles) from flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM1, we learn that ""[this law] would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Another obstacle the building crew of the Empire State Building was faced with when constructing the mooring mast was nature itself. Because of the violent wind currents near the top of the building, the way the wind blew constantly changed, causing a great difficulty for any dirigible to connect to the mast properly. In paragraph @NUM2, we are told about how if it were possible to connect the mast to a dirigible that the back would swing. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical or safe."" Because there were too many obstacles with not enough safe options, the mooring mast project were shut down; proving that during its construction its builders were faced with too many obstacles."	3	3		3																					
16614	6	"To design a mast for the dirigibles to land was no easy matter architects could not just plop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof The stress from a thousand foot dirigible would transmit weight and wind pressure all the way to the foundation. To be able to create this mast the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthend. First, the architects ""designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a steeped-back design that imitated the overall shapp of the building itself."" This rocket shapped mast would have four wings at its corners of aluminum and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. For the winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring, they would be placed in the back of the machinery. Finnally, when this was all completed the existing plans for the building were to be put in place."	1	1		1																					
16624	6	"The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. for example it would have been almost impossible to dock with the violent winds blowing at that height. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". It would not have been @CAPS2 to land a dirigible there because the text is saying the winds at that height were not stable and that the ship would be tossing and turning in the air. Another obstacle the @CAPS1 faced was the law of airships flying to low to the ground. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" That's saying that even if a dirigible could moor at the Empire State Building, It's illegal because all airships have to fly a certain height over urban area. The workers building the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles were just to great to overcome. Thus no dirigibles have successfully docked there, and none ever will."	3	3		3																					
16629	6	"The one obstacle the builders had when trying to build this building was not away for the dirigibels landing to be convinient for all. The dirigibels have a very fast speed of eight miles per hour, and they were as big as four blocks of New York City, paragraph @NUM1. This was a problem for the builders because the dirigibels were very big, and the building it self as well. The siz was a problem because the enormouse dirigibels woud not be landing in the right space. Having lack of time was always a problem because the building would not be completed on time. The builders always had to hold back because ""engineers consulted with experts... architects met with presidents"" paragraph @NUM2. Holding back on the making of the buiding to meet with thouse people took away time. When there is something very high, and wide in the way there will be a problem."	2	0		0

There was this particular time when @DATE1, @CAPS1 and I were feeling more giggly than usual. It tends to happen a lot when we're together, but this time was way different than the others.

""@CAPS7 since @CAPS2 has car he can drive into town and buy some cheap saran rap then @CAPS15 back to the four way intersection right out side of my neighborhood and tie the rap around two of the trees on opposite sides of the street so cars will speed through it!"" I quick explained as i ran out of breath. Bursts of loud laughter came from all directions were my friends were standing as I came to realization that this idea was golden. ""I will drive and go get it, but does anyone got some money too pitch in!"" @CAPS2 pounced as @LOCATION2, @CAPS6 and I, handed single bills to him.  "" that's plenty! give me a few minutes then we can meet at the intersection right out side of @CAPS10's neighborhood."" @CAPS2 said as he brushed everyone off his car and begin to dip out of my neighborhood. ""@CAPS12 text me when you're about to get back!"" I screamed to @CAPS2 as sound of his poorly maintained engine bellowed in the @TIME1 sky. Minutes flew by and the rest of us just sat down on the curb, talked, and waited for @CAPS2. Ring ting my custom ring tone for incoming texts sounded. My eyes quickly scanned the phone's contents and concluded that @CAPS2 was ready with the saran rap at the four way intersection.  ""@CAPS15 on @CAPS1 @CAPS4 go! @CAPS2 is ready and so @CAPS1 do this thing"" I muttered as i grabbed my jacket and headed for the exit of my neighborhood. @CAPS6 trailed, as @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 brought up the back. i yelled once again to enhance the passe. @CAPS2's car lights lit up the @ORGANIZATION1 air as he made a blinking signal to express where he was to us. All four of us quickly jogged over to the drive way of a house that was for sale right near the exit of my neighborhood to where @CAPS2 was parked. ""@CAPS17 you @CAPS4 long enough,"" @CAPS2 explained. ""well we are all here! so @CAPS1 go to the intersection and set this up!"" @PERSON1 explained as the started too lead toward the intersection which was about fifty yards away. As we reached the intersection there were no cars! We all @CAPS17 to this opportunity and @NUM1 and @PERSON1 look out for cars!"" i yelled as @CAPS2 and i began the process. Quickly i opened the saran rap and ran crossed the road, uncoiling the rap as i went. Soon as @CAPS2 and I were both on opposite sides of the street we both started to firmly rap the saran around trees we have already pick out. Once i pulled and inspected it finding that it was prefect i sprinted to a short fence that was a boarder for the neighborhood on one side of the intersection. i was guessing this was where all my friends were hiding. ""haha this is prefect! i am made sure everything feels right!"" I explained as we all gazed upon delicately hung rap than ran from both sides of the two way street. ""@CAPS21 we must wait,"" @PERSON2 said as anticipation fell into place. Four heads bobbed up and down as we checked to see if cars were driving down the road. Since it was about @NUM2 pm most of the good folk of @LOCATION1 were sleeping or inside. But suddenly a car came out of @CAPS21 were, speeding and only @NUM3 yards from the great prank. ""@CAPS22,"" i yelled as the car continued driving closer and closer. Boom! The car speed through the saran rap, then came to a screeching stop. Laughter burst out as the inspected target was completely in disarray. But the anger male driver hearing our laughing decided too leave his car and chase us! ""@CAPS23 up,"" I screamed! We all @CAPS23 right as the man reached the fence where we were hiding. Although it was too late for @CAPS6! The anger man caught him as the rest of us all high tailed it for my house. As soon as we reached my house we all began too ask our self's what happened too @CAPS6! Suddenly out of @CAPS21 where @CAPS6 came running, as he @CAPS22 reached us we started too burst into laughter once again! The whole left side of @CAPS6 was dripping with soda! @CAPS6 would never tell us what happened that @ORGANIZATION1 although we could have guessed! As the @CAPS25 and long @ORGANIZATION1 rapped up we all called quits and hit the sack at my house. But laughter wasn't in short supply that @ORGANIZATION1 as we all fell asleep!"	22	20		42				5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20747	8	" These days you don't really need a reason to laugh. Laughter just radiates out of some people as frequent as a breath of air. I believe that everyone has someone they can laugh with because everyone has someone they enjoy being around. One of the people I enjoy being around most is my best friend @PERSON1. No matter what the situation, whenever we are around each other we end up having fun. Laughter can turn a bad day completely around. One of my most recent examples of the power of laughter happened just a few weeks ago. One of my, ""friends"", tried to play a cruel joke on me that ended up being a bigger mistake than she could have imagined. Once I had figured out that this person whom I once trusted was trying to spite me I became overwhelmed with my emotions. At one point I actually considered attacking this girl right in the middle of every one in school. Thankfully I used my better judgment to run away from her, and hide instead of hurt her. Half of the class period progressed and I was still very upset and unprepared to confront her. So there I stayed safe in hiding until my best friend found me. @PERSON1 had come to comfort me after she got wind of what happened. She talked to me until I calmed down and my tears stopped. She made me feel much better. Her just being there for me, and being able to remonis in the fun times we had together and the laughs we shared, seemed to make all my problems disappear. Eventually she convinced me to go talk to my,""friend"", who as it turns out was ashamed of herself for her actions. We were able to make up and return to a somewhat normal life. To this day and more than likely for the rest of my life I will believe that laughter is the best medicine. I guess I'm lucky in that I have found the best person in life for me to share all of my laughter with. Every body has to have a somebody."	18	20		38				3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20755	8	" ""Laughter is the key to the soul."" @CAPS1 you are having the worst day of your life, or the best day of your life, laughing can always make it better. I was sitting in @CAPS2 class one day, and was bored out of my mind. Then, a shy, quiet kid, all of a sudden started laughing! @CAPS3 couldn't stop! It was like @CAPS3 was on ""laughing gas."" @CAPS3 laughed so hard @CAPS3 couldn't breathe. Now this made me laugh, and then my best friend sitting next to me laugh. Soon enough the entire class was laughing! So even though some of the people in @CAPS2 class might have been bored, or had a bad day, the laughter was spread throughout the room, making it a better day. Laughter spreads like wildfire, and it makes everyone happier. And when you are happier, you are healthier. So with that, a @CAPS2 relationship must have laughter in it, in order to work. When you ask someone what they like about there boyfriend or girlfriend, if it is a @CAPS2 relationship, they will almost always say, ""@CAPS3/she makes me laugh."" @CAPS5 when you don't have laughter in a relationship, you end up in more fights, more disagreements, and more disappointment. The more you laugh the more you can live a better life and enjoy life more. Have you laughed today?"	15	15		30				3	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
20759	8	" As I waited in the car, anxious to meet my best friend and man I'm in love with, I started to laugh. Not because something my mother or brother said was funny, or because I saw something funny, but I was nervous. I'd talked to him countless times on the phone, many many text messages, and countless emails. But I was still nervous. I knew him better than I knew most people, yet my anxiety seemed to be making me lose my sanity.  As our black rental sedan pulled up to where he was waiting outside of where his family lived, I got more nervous. @CAPS6 if he wasn't actually the way I thought he was? @CAPS6 if he didn't like me? @CAPS6 if I didn't like him? As soon as he stepped into the car, smiling brightly at me, my nervous laughter and my anxiety all melted away. I smiled back. ""@CAPS1, @PERSON1,"" he said. ""@CAPS1 @PERSON2,"" I said, butterflies in my stomach. I was smiling broadly still, he reached out and cautiously took my hand.  ""@CAPS3 was the drive?"" he asked, lightly squeezing my hand. ""@CAPS4, and nerve wracking,"" I replied, nervous laughter bubbling up again. ""@CAPS5 your here now, and I'm very happy @CAPS7 are,"" he said, smiling. And for the rest of the car ride to the restaurant our conversation flowed so smoothly I thought I was dreaming. Here him and I were two guys in love with one another, a new thing for both of us, and we were happy as can be. The whole car ride we held hands ad talked, I felt like I'd known him my whole life. Not just the year and a half I'd known him.  We arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 all too fast and all of us got out of the car, I was famished and so was he. But we had to wait for a table for a half-hour before we sat down. Once at the dinner table my mother, who was very happy I found someone I loved so much and knew of our love, started regaling us with tales of my childhood. It was one of the most embarassing moments of my life. I was bright red for almost the entire time she told these stories. Some of which I remembered, others I did not. @PERSON2 laughed and joked wth me about all of them. Which made my nervous laughter come out as actual laughter. It also helped that he was holding my hand under the table.  After we ate dinner and dessert we went to the nearby mall for some shopping and to just hang out. My mom and brother went one way, and @PERSON2 and I went another. We bought some clothes together and finally ended up in a book store. My favorite book store, @ORGANIZATION3's. Back in my favorite section, young adult fiction, I noticed @PERSON2 staring at me. ""@CAPS6?"" I asked stupidly. He smiled deviously.  ""@CAPS7 just look very... In your element,"" he smirked.  ""@CAPS8?"" I said, in mock confusion. He just smiled and took my hand in his again. ""@CAPS9 problem,"" he said, squeezing my hand. He pulled me closer to him, we were the only people in this area of the store. ""@CAPS10 if I'm a little forward?"" he asked. I shook my head @CAPS9. He leaned in and kissed me very gently on the lips, I blushed a bright red and started to giggle after our lips parted. He quirked an eyebrow, I knew @CAPS6 he was thinking just by the look on his face.  ""That felt fantastic,"" I said, putting my fingers on my lips. I had a silly grin on my face.  ""@CAPS11,"" he simply said, kissing me again. ""I love your laugh, love,"" he told me, I was on cloud nine, I was truly in love with somebody and I felt great! I'd never been this happy before. Except maybe the first time I went to @ORGANIZATION2. But this was definitely better, because it could last much longer. Which it has, since we've been together ever since. Both our gazes fixed our future together. Now whenever I remember that I was start to giggle happily to myself. Yes I get a stare every once in a while, but I don't care. Laughter is the thing that helped bridge the gap between him and I. Making us the closest we've ever been."	23	24		47				4	4	5	5	5	5	4	5	5	5	5	5						
20771	8	"Someone once told me that laughter is the key element of comfort. I believe that @CAPS7 is one of the most important part of any relationship. @CAPS7's what brings people together. A perfect example; about two years ago in the middle of fall, I was crying about my dog passing away. My ex-boyfriend tried everything to make me feel better but nothing was working. I was so hurt I told him I just wanted to be alone and he understood. As he was walking away he slipped and landed in a puddle. The way he fell reminded me of the cartoonSpongebob @CAPS1, when @ORGANIZATION1 slipped on a banana and fell hard. I looked at him and his entire back-side was drenched. His cheeks were cherry-red with embarrassment. I just busted out laughing, I couldn't help @CAPS7. He saw that water had gotten all over me, then he started laughing. That was a moment of comfort brought on by laughter. Whenever we had a promblem, we could always laugh @CAPS7 off. That's actually how I met him. I was hanging out with a couple of my friends and we decided to go see a movie calledStep-@CAPS2. There was this one seen where one of the characters said, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS3 that was so funny, last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur,"" then other character looked like he was going to cry. I thought that was so funny. After the movie was over my friend @PERSON1 suggested that we go back to his house. When we got there, @CAPS4 was waiting on the steps for @PERSON1. @PERSON1 stood back a second then said, ""aw were you waiting for me little one."" @CAPS4 replied with, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS3 that was so funny , last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur."" I laughed so hard I almost went the bathroom on myself. @CAPS4 and myself were the only ones laughing and we just clicked. If he wasn't funny I can honestly say I would've never been with him. I love laughter. I believe @CAPS7's the easiest way to trigger the best emotions."	15	18		33				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	4	4						
20775	8	" One time when i was spending the night at @ORGANIZATION1's she wanted to sleep oustide in a tent. @CAPS2 was @DATE1 and we always tryed seeing eachother anytime possible because she had to go back to boarding school alot. So her mom set up the tent for us on the deck, and after we ate dinner, we grabbed our things and went ouside. She was on the phone with her boyfriend and i was on the phone with mine, and both of them were best friends. @CAPS2 was like two best friends dating two bestfriends, and we were closer then ever. My boyfriend had to get off the phone because he had work in the @TIME1 so @CAPS2 was just @LOCATION1 on the phone. I started saying really funny things and she just started laughing so hard that she snorted and at the time she was still on the phone with her boyfriend. At this point i was just cracking up with laughfter, @ORGANIZATION1 started laughing even harder because she saw me laughing and pee'd her self while she was on the phone with her boyfriend. For some reason she forgot that she was on the phone with him and started laughing even more after that happend, so all of this was going on at around one in the @TIME1 and i was surprised her mom didn't come out and yell at us for being loud. When i looked over and saw that she had pee'd her self i yelled out ""@CAPS1 my god, @CAPS3 pee'd your self @ORGANIZATION1!"" @CAPS2 was the most funniest thing, i dont think i have ever laughed so hard in my entire life. So her boyfriend finally got her attention and said ""@CAPS3 should probably go take care of that,"" and then they got off the phone. She was really embarassed after that, i mean i would be too if that happend to me."	15	18		33				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
20778	8	" @CAPS10 @CAPS10 @CAPS10 , @CAPS1 @CAPS1 @CAPS1, and now even @CAPS2 ( @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5). Laughter! some say it is the best median. It can brighten a cloudy day, cure a case of the blues, and even sooth a breaking heart.  On the other hand a simple sinker or soft giggle can break a heart to! I have had first hand experience listening to goofy squeals being thrown my way and not because I told a witty joke simply just for siting, siting in my @NUM1 grade class room and becoming the but of my pears jokes. Before I go on with this story there are a few things @CAPS6 must know. Let alone that all @NUM1 graders have a common undeniable erg to bring people down so they can build them self's up. I was a @NUM1 grader who's weight had reached the point at witch my doctors were telling me ""@CAPS6 should look in to a weight loss program."" this news alone was crushing my self a steam and my class mates laughter soon brought me to tears. I can recall a particular @CAPS7, perhaps one of the worst. I was on the buss and almost home when @NUM4 girls who i thought were my friends started laughing. Little did I know it was me they were laughing at so I joined in what i thought, and what seamed to be some @CAPS8 giggling. Suddenly they stopped, looked at me started whispering to each other then one of the girls blurted @CAPS4 between chuckles ""@CAPS6 look like a beached wail!"". She said this so @CAPS5 the whole buss herd and immediately burst in to side spiting laughter. I walked down the same street i walked down every day were the buss dropped me off. That day it seamed more gloomy then ever before. This is the day I decided I was never going to set foot on the buss again! It is encounters with laughter like this that broke my heart but also gave me a strong motivation towards loosing weight and regaining confidence. Days, weeks, months, even years have passed scene that day in the @NUM1 grade. I'm @NUM6 pounds lighter, a varsity cheerleader and proved of who I am. The tables have turned for me in many ways. I am no longer the person who gets laughed at because of my weight, but some times i catch my self sometimes mindlessly cracking a joke or two at some one else expense. I can recall just the other day, I was with my best friend at the mall. She spotted this girl who was over weight and immediately started giggling and elbowing me in the side trying to draw my attention to her like she was some freak show. When I saw the girl my first reaction was a hideous @CAPS3 but just as soon as I did so i felt the same pain I felt when that buss full of my pears laughed at me. I immediately stopped, realizing the pain my laughter could have brought her. My self, I am a very funny person and will do just about any thing for a @CAPS3. But when it comes to laughing at people and hurting there feelings this is were i draw the line because i know how it feels to be in there position and i hope that my story helps open the eyes of u and others to the harmful effects some laughter can have. So go ahead and @CAPS10 @CAPS10 @CAPS10, @CAPS1 @CAPS1 @CAPS1, and even @CAPS2 just not at the expense of another persons feelings."	20	18	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3
20781	8	" The laughter in me.  To me all you need to do to get through a tough and horrible day is a good @CAPS5. It gives you hope throughout the day, and no matter what kind of mood your in, when leaving to work, going to school, or really any activity that involves a ""sigh"" moment. For me I get that feeling about school, but I can always count on my best friend, @PERSON1. Everyday she manages to say something totally off topic and we'd end up dying of laughter at the top of the stairs near the science labs were we eat lunch. As people walk by they give us weird looks, we don't care because we understand each other. To me @CAPS9 is my way of reliving stress.My @CAPS1 agrees with me her name is @CAPS2 I call her @ORGANIZATION1. We've been best friends since the second grade. She is my rock. She inspires me to do something with my life, something more than working at some fast food restaurant. I hang out a lot at her at her house and we share so many great and fun memories. Its really bad when we are around each other, its like one look at each other and boom!, I'm on the floor not breathing because I'm dying of laughter. I don't know what it is but, its like when we see each other its a rush off all the good times we've spent coming together all at once. Sometimes we @CAPS5 hysterically over nothing. I doesn't make sense but I guess that doesn't matter when your hanging with your best bud.  Laughter is an important part of my relationship with anyone. Its shows me how fun a person can be and if the have a sense of humor. It shows me that they can smile and not some stuck up want to be perfect robot. All @PERSON1 and I talk about is boys and boy problems and it makes me @CAPS5 and giggle, but when we are in our fifth period class forestry and fire we are like caged monkeys in a zoo. It's like we are magically ""high,"" all of a sudden have this out burst of energy. We sit next to sit side by side to one another and we tickle each other and @CAPS5 really loud. By the end of class I make a paper ball and we play paper soccer ball its fun especially when the teacher gives you dirty looks and tells you to stop and you don't do it. Lets just say that her face turns a very bright red color.Nothing compares to how much I @CAPS5 when I'm with @ORGANIZATION1. When I used to go to @CAPS3 I had three classes with her @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS4. We also had lunch together, but anyway as I was saying, I swear we had a not stop @CAPS9 war everyday. My @CAPS5 is more like a cackle mixed with giggling. Some people like, some thinks its cute, others think I @CAPS5 funny( The weird kind of funny). In @ORGANIZATION2 she'd stand next to me and she'd look at me weird, or said something that didn't come out right, or sang obnoxiously, anything she did cracked me up it was so distracted when she was around but so much fun. I swear I got all of my exercise from @CAPS9 with her. At home when my family is all together, are way of laughter is mostly picking on one another. It's different than laughter with your friends. We make fun of how my sister @CAPS6 was supposed to be a boy because everybody thought she was going to be a boy when she was in our mothers stomach. We made fun of my brother for being the only boy out of five kids. We make fun of my sister @PERSON2 for being the shortest one in our family. I can feel the difference between laughter. It's mostly criticism really.I @CAPS5 mostly because I feel more alive it gives me something to live for everyday in stead of ""@CAPS7 great, another day to try to get through, @CAPS8...no."" @CAPS9 for me gets me motivated for the day it's like my drug to get through life. It gives me an easy way in to communicate with others. I thank @CAPS10 for giving us the ability to @CAPS5 because without it I would lose my mind and have a hard time making friends. ""That's how I make friends I @CAPS5.""  "	15	20	40	40				4	3	4	4	2	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4

As I stared at the majestic destruction of the warm, humid air, I felt someone or something watching me from behind. The weight of the sixty pounds of wood started to get heavy as I walked from one side of the house to the other. Finally, I reached the trailer just to be told by @PERSON4, my best friends mom, the she didn't think we would need that much wood. I thought to myself the this was going to be a long weekend. After about two hours of packing clothes, food, water, sleeping bags, pillows, and tents we headed out for @ORGANIZATION1. It would be about two hours of driving, that felt like twenty minutes. @PERSON3, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and I were the worst group of people to put into one car. We all yell and fight and punch at each other just for fun. Once we arrived at our destination, we sprung out of the car like a hive of angry bees. I race @PERSON2 to the @ORGANIZATION1. the second we were done unpacking our belongings. The first few days were spent basking in the one hundred degree heat, swimming, and flirting with the random girls we found around the camp site. We slept as little as possible, so that we could enjoy the friendship and just pure fun we were having. During day two, we decided to go mountain biking. We were on those bikes for hours before we noticed the sun was going down. In the moment we all turned and saw the most extravagant view the earth has ever created. There were burst of orange and red. The colors ricochet from cloud to cloud. After hours of riding our bikes in the heat, we chose to go for a swim. As we swam I felt something touching my foot. Then all of a sudden there was a hand on my foot. When I looked down to see who was grabbing me, it was only a stick. As I looked closer, it turned out to be a root system of a fallen tree. It looked fake, as if someone or something had put it there. This though sparked a conversation about @CAPS2 for the day to come.  The sparks danced together as if they were @CAPS4 and the @LOCATION1. The only light we had was the brilliant glow of the fire. @PERSON3 was playing a gorgeous melody on his guitar. As I listened and enjoyed the flawlessness of nature, I felt someone watching me from behind. I nudged @PERSON3 and when we turned around, our hearts stopped. There was a spinning green light, almost twenty feet in the air. I spoke the word everyone was dreading, @CAPS2. I had slowly stood up and the light started spinning faster. I quickly grabbed the machete, that was next to me, and approached the light. As I grew closer, I could make out small figured in the @CAPS1 shadows. Then, an eruption of children laughing came booming from the direction of the light. A little boy emerged, unable to control is laughter, and ran away. After returning to my seat next to the camp fire, I thought about life. What if @CAPS2 were real and they are watching us. No, there not real. I laughed it off, and continued my week long vacation."	18	15		33				4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
20784	8	" What makes you laugh? Laughter is a really good stress reliever. There are many different types of laughs around the world, some people's laughs are really high pitched and others @MONTH1 be very deep and low. Some other people snort and make other animal noises. I know that for me I have many different types of laughs for all the different emotions I feel. When I am upset I have a very distinctive laugh. Although when I am upset I laugh to make myself feel better and have a better day.   One time during a basketball game, I was having a really off night. Fouls were being called on me left and right. Normally when this happens to me, I get really mad and I lose my head and end up being taken out of the game and sitting on the bench. I absolutely hate sitting on the bench. This time when I got a foul called on me after already being threatened to be ejected from the previous game for the same reason. I decided to just smile and laugh about the foul and told myself to shake it off. My coach was very pleased with my change in attitude and just told me to play defense with my feet and to shake the bad call off and keep my head. When you are mad a person can take a lot away from the demonstrative looks you can make, although if you just smile and laugh about it, their reactions will be a lot different. I am not the only one on my basketball team who feels this way. A lot of us just laugh about calls that are made and just shake them off.  I am also a cheerleader. When you are a cheerleader you should always try to have a smile on your face at all times, and make it seem like you are in a happy mood. I play in a basketball game every night before I go out and cheer. I have to do my best to keep my cool while playing so that I'm in a good mood for after my game when I do cheer. Laughing helps me a lot with keeping my cool and relaxing while I am playing, so I'm in a good mood for cheer.  My coach is also very huge on people having positive attitudes. She tells us at practice that if we just smile and laugh about things that go wrong the outcome will be a lot better then if we have bad attitudes about it. I took this in very strongly and it stayed with me. My coach inflenced me to have a better attitude and since that day I have tried to have a positive attitude. I keep my positive attitude by just smiling and laughing when things in my life go wrong.  A laugh can go a really long way. I personally think laughing helps express the mood you are in. Laughing is also good for the body. Laughing can make you feel one hundred times better when you are feeling down in the dumps. I try my hardest to be in a good mood at all times. I really don't like being in a bad mood, it's really not fun. Laughing makes me feel a lot better.  I think that laughing is a very good function for the body. I feel that when I laugh it makes my mood better and the moods of the people around me a lot better. Laughing is a magical feeling that goes through out your body and makes you feel warm inside. I think everyone should laugh at least once a day. It will make your day that much better."	17	20		37				4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20795	8	" Its always hard to know what to do when a friend or family member comes to you when they are sad or mad. Most of the time you don't know what to do. I have learned that making people laugh with something as simple as a joke can always make them feel better. As I was sitting at home one sunny afternoon, I got a call from my friends @PERSON1. When I put the phone to my ear all I could hear was a loud crying. @PERSON1 wasn't saying anything to me, not one word. Even though, I repeatedly asked her what was wrong with her, @PERSON1 wouldn't even say a word. Not knowing what to do or say to her anymore, I asked her to calm down and take deep breaths. Desperately, I wanted her to be able to talk to me and tell me what was going on because I had started to get really worry. Couple minutes later, @PERSON1 started explaining to me what had happen. @PERSON1 started off by telling me she was irresponsible that she didn't pay attention to what was happening around her. I asked her why she was saying that about herself because I knew she was a responsible person. Finally, @PERSON1 screamed that while she was home watching the @CAPS1 basketball team play basketball, her dog @CAPS2 got run over. The dog had actually died. I found it very ridiculous and pathetic that @PERSON1 would be crying over her dog. I didn't want to be rude about it and tell her what was going threw my mind at that time. Even thought that was the way I felt about the whole situation. I thought of what the words I needed to say to @PERSON1 but I was confuse. Actually, it wasn't so much that I was confuse, I was afraid of hurting her feelings with my words. Finally, I decided to tell her not to worry about her dog, that my friend had a couple of dogs for sale. Also, I told @PERSON1 that if it made her feel any better I would buy her a new puppy. After saying that to her there was an awkward silence. My hands started to get shaky because I thought @PERSON1 was mad. All of the sudden I just heard her start laughing really loud and once again she couldn't talk. I felt so relief that I had made her laugh and not cry or get mad at me. @PERSON1 wouldn't shut her mouth she just laughed and laughed and laugh hysterically. Finally, she shut her mouth up and started talking to me again. @PERSON1 thanked me for making her laugh and making a joke out the situation. Rather than saying depressing words that would make her feel bad and make her cry even more. I was happy I made her laugh because she felt better about herself and not worst. As I was laughing I told her that anytime she needed to laugh I was the person she needed to be call. Anytime, any day and anywhere I would be happy to bring a smile to her face and a loud laugh to her mouth. @PERSON1 laughed with me and thank me one more time for making her laugh. From that day on I always like to make people laugh because I know I'm going to make them feel better. I sure love it when others make me laugh too. It's just an amazing feeling, a great feeling that everyone loves and cant really describe. After making my friend @PERSON1 laugh I found out laughter was a key element of life.

Like this one time me and my friends where walking to the store, I start pointing out the most random things. When I pointed out the @CAPS1 store, he started laughing so hard that he literally peed his pants. So we had to go back to his house so he could change into some clean cloth, and it took him @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes to get dressed. So I asked @CAPS6 he was doing in there, and he said. ""I'm taking a pee."" @CAPS2 I started laughing and rolling on the floor, and that's when it hit me why he was laughing so hard about me pointing out the @CAPS1 store. It was because the last time we had gone inside and there was a man talking about his son's football team which my friend and I was on at the time, was in the top ten. Guss @CAPS6 we really weren't. The man felt so afraid of @CAPS6 the lady he was talking to might think of him. So @CAPS5 gets up and says to us. ""@CAPS4 you for letting me know that. I thought he was right for a second."" @CAPS5 gives us a hug and the man gets up and says. ""@CAPS6 about me? How come I don't get a hug."" That when I started to laugh harder @CAPS2 heck. Good thing I did not have to go to the rest room. "	13	17	30	30				2	2	2	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3
20841	8	" As we understand the benefits of laughter, we realize that we cant live without it. Its one of those things that are always going to be with us through tough times, and the joy of life. So when people say ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", well there right! You can think anything you want to, but i want you to know that i have the best laughter in the world when it comes to the boy i have fallen for.  It all started on a softball tournament in bend. Our team drove there for the weekend to play our tournament and we stayed in the @LOCATION2 inn hotel. Which was very nice by the way, probably to nice for our team, because we end up destroying the place like a bunch of football players in a locker room, hence the hard practices. After our practice we go ahead and swim in the pool, even know we have a big game the next day. The hotel had two big pools, one outside, and one inside with a sauna. We all go to the inside pool because in was way to cold outside. Then everything from there was a little different. My friend @PERSON3 and I go into the sauna after swimming to relax and just talk a bit. After a while two boys about our age enter the sauna while we were still in there. They acted as if they were nervous and shy, so they sat down and started talking to us which was kind of awkward, no doubt. When it comes to boys I'm not shy to just speak my mind and to ask them why the hell there just sitting there pretending to mind there own business, and i know for a fact that's not why. We talk a laugh for a bit and got to know each other. One of them was extremely adorable and i hit it off with him very well. It got later into the @TIME1 and it was time for all of us to head back to our rooms and say good bye for ever. Me and @PERSON3 shared a room with her parents. I had know idea that @PERSON3 gave my number to @PERSON1, the guy i kind of liked in the sauna. About ten minutes later i get a text saying ""meet me outside to walk around"". So i amused that it was him, and i got all excited! so we snuck out of the room for the @TIME1. All we did was walk around the hotel and talk, he was barefooted and as cute as can be. I never laughed so hard in my life! He made me smile and feel like i could con-core everything that came my way.  About forty five minutes past, still gazing into each others eyes, feeling like it as only been a second. His friend @PERSON2 sees someone walking out a the hotel room and realizes that its his mom. They bolt off saying there goodbyes and at the last second he kisses me on the cheek for his farewell. Never in my life have i experienced something so exciting and fun, and most of all i understand the importance of laughter. Knowing that i would never see him again is what kills me. He lives in @CAPS1 and i live in @LOCATION1. How could anything possibly happen between us? Maybe some day i will meet him again. Maybe someday i would be able to talk to him again like we did that @TIME1, and just maybe, will i fall in love with him. All those maybe's have came true, because i fallowed what was right and i waited. Now sense that all happened i can ponder and relate to laughter and how it effected me in life. That is what brought us together, and I'm happy that all of that could happen so quick in my young life."	17	16		33				4	4	4	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	3	3						
20848	8	" Laughter is something everyone needs in their life. We all need some humor, and even sometimes, we need to laugh at ourselves. You need a laugh, a smile and a sense of humor to live life to it's fullest. When people take things other have said, differently, or even thinking a joke was said way too harsh, and they take it the wrong way. People told me, ""you need a sense of humor, you know?"" @CAPS1, I feel bad for taking it too seriously. Back, my sophomore year, I was going through a rough time. With friends, and family becoming more and more apart from each other. I don't even remember laughing or smiling last year. Let's just say, through the first four to five months of sophomore year, it was hard trying to crack at a simple joke. Once, sophomore year was coming to a close, I realized there was more to life @CAPS1 moping around in my own self-pity. It was getting close to @DATE1 vacation and I know I wanted to make @DATE1, and my junior year, my year, and that no one would ruin it for me. After from being all sad and not having any fun, and laughing at the jokes my dad made about me, I know I needed to hang out with him a lot more. When my dad and I hung out, we had more laughs @CAPS1 I couldn't even remember having. It was a really good memory to have. Especially with my dad. My self-esteem was getting a lot better @CAPS1 it use to be. I was really happy with myself that I only tried once, and now I had a better relationship with my dad, too. So far, life was going great for me. I realized that I was more happy when I recognized myself and told people the real truth about me. I have to say, I never smiled, nor laughed as much as I did in a while. The truth about me was that I was diagnosed with gender identity disorder. I didn't go through any therapy, I just knew it was the real me, and it was probably why I was so sad my sophomore year. When I discovered myself, I knew there was a lot more to life @CAPS1 getting a better reputation. I was able to smile a lot more and just appreciate everything and everyone wanting to become my friend, or even get to know me a lot more. It was a really good feeling knowing that people wanted to be interested in me a lot more and would ask me questions about who I wanted to be called, and what a trans-gender was. I felt wanted, interesting, secure, and most of all; happy. I know I was going to get more harassment down the road from coming out. I got a lot of restricted numbers calling me and I laughed at all of them who sent me hate mail, calls, and text messages. It was really worth the laugh, because I knew what I was talking about and they didn't know a thing about transgenders, or gender identity disorder. Hanging out with my dad and more friends really paid off. I survived through a hot @DATE1 and now it was time for school. I was really excited for it to start, and even more excited for the sports ahead of me. I knew I was gonna kick butt my junior year and not let anyone get in the way of it. When it was around my birthday, like, a month into the school year, I realized I needed someone there all the time to just make me laugh and smile all the time. Not that I wasn't smiling or laughing, I just know I needed it more in my life. There was a girl that started talking to me on @CAPS2-book. She was really cute, her personality fit her so well and already she knew how to make me smile so big, my cheeks would end up burning. Her name was @PERSON2, and that also fit her, everything was just so great about her. We ended up talking on the phone at twelve, in the @TIME1, on my birthday. By far, that was the best night I had in a while and the sweetest thing anyone has every done for me. @PERSON2 and I hung out that weekend at @CAPS3 @CAPS4, in @LOCATION1. When we headed up there her friend, @PERSON1, was singing to the songs by @CAPS5, while @PERSON2 mocked her squeaky voice. I never laughed so hard that my stomach would cringe in pain. So, you see, having a lot of people there to make you laugh is a really amazing feeling to have. You even have to laugh at yourself and make fun of how idiotic you sounded. Getting to know someone new is a perfect feeling, especially when they make your heart melt, and give you butterflies every time they say something sweet to you. Even just to make your @CAPS2 light up with a smile."	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	3						
20852	8	" Laughter is a very important part of life, for many different reasons. Some @MONTH1 say that its vital to survive, one needs laughter to have a full and rich life. Sometimes laughter can hurt more than it helps. This is a statement I myself believe, and have concluded from the actions and outcomes in my life. Laughter can show emotions towards a statement, or lack of emotions. Laughter can make someone either depressed or happy. It is true when someone says there is a difference when someone is laughing at you, as opposed to someone laughing with you. When a friend or a group of friends laugh with me, its an amazing, self esteem raising emotion. This laughter brings friends closer, and causes us to trust each other more. One time I thought laughing was appropriate at the time but then later felt awful. One scorching @DATE1 day my friends and I decided to venture to the mall, being we lived in apartments and lacked the money for an air conditioner. We all agreed it was a splendid idea. When we reached the mall we were relieved by the cool breeze as the doors swung open, as if to greet us. All of us are very introverted so shopping around in an over crowded mall wasn't our cup of tea. Not knowing what to @CAPS1 we sat on a bench and did what we call people watching. Their was this girl, I will always remember her; @CAPS4 was one of those girls you peer at just for a minute and you know @CAPS4 was rich. A sort of stuck up girl, a walk where @CAPS4 means to exaggerate her hips and bounce her perfect bleach blond hair.  The girl passed by us and stuck her nose in the air as if we were not even remotely good enough to be in her presence. Quite a bit angry I stood up after @CAPS4 strolled past and mocked her strut. My friends found this hysterical. Roars of laughter leaped from their mouths. The pressy girl stopped proceeding forward and then started approaching us. @CAPS4 grimaces at us all snobby-like and says, ""@CAPS1 you guys like have a problem or something?"" @CAPS2 covered my face, I didn't know what to say. Fortunately my best friend stepped in and said, ""@CAPS3, we think your dress is very pretty."" @CAPS4 believed us, then walked off, in a rather less snobby sort of way.  Through this weird and interesting experience my friends and I learned a lot. One, people can hear you talking crap about them from a mile away. Two, laughter can bring friends together, but can also have some consequences. I @CAPS1 not know for sure if @CAPS4 did hear or see us mocking her. But I knew inside I felt a little bad. Sure laughing at her in the time felt right, amusing. Looking back on it, I feel awful. I have been in that same situation but on the receiving end. It is not pleasant having people talking crap about you behind your back and laughing uncontrollably. Laughing is very vital to life but needs to be appropriate."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20857	8	" Seeing one of @CAPS15 best friends trip and hit his face on a screen door, was enough to make myself laugh. Its was the @DATE1 after @CAPS15 @NUM1 grade year of school. I was having @CAPS15 friends @PERSON2, @PERSON3 and @CAPS15 neighbor @PERSON1 stay the night at @CAPS15 house. @CAPS25 ever we got bored we usually went around @CAPS15 neighborhood ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3"" some houses to have some fun. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3"" is @CAPS25 @CAPS21 quietly sneak up to someones front door, ring the door bell a couple times and then @CAPS23 run away. All four of us were hanging out that day. It was a great @DATE1 day, gorgeous sun, warm temperature and a nice gentle breeze to cool off your face.@CAPS25 it came to night fall we were all in @CAPS15 room playing @CAPS7 @NUM2.  ""I'm bored bro,"" @PERSON2 said to the other three of us.  ""@CAPS8 then, think of something to @CAPS19,""@CAPS9 replied  ""I can't think of anything,"" @PERSON1 stated with a bored look on his face. We sat for a while thinking of something to @CAPS19 to entertain the four of us. ""I got it!"" I said with a confident smirk ,""lets go @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!"" "" I down for that ,""@PERSON2 said ""@CAPS13 me too ,""@CAPS9 and @PERSON1 replied shortly after @PERSON2. As we were walking out @CAPS15 front door @CAPS15 mom shouted ,""where are @CAPS21 boys going?"" @CAPS15 mom caught me off guard. I didn't know what to say ,""uh, we are going on a walk ,""I replied hesitantly.  ""@CAPS16 be safe,"" @CAPS15 mom said as I walked out of the door. We @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ditched a couple house, but that was starting to get boring and then it hit me like a typhoon. I came up with the best idea I have thought of yet.  ""@CAPS18 this is what needs to happen, I'm going to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS28 the first house, @PERSON2 @CAPS21 get the next one, @PERSON1 @CAPS21 get the house at the corner and @PERSON3 will run around the corner to get the last house.   ""@CAPS19 @CAPS21 think that will work?"" @PERSON1 asked.  ""@CAPS20 yes it will work!"" I said,""@CAPS21 @CAPS18 ready?""   ""I guess so ,"" @PERSON1 replied shortly after @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 yes. We all lined up in place. I rang the first door bell and started running, then I saw @PERSON2 slam his clinched fist on the second door, next i didn't see @PERSON1 ring the door bell because he was already running ahead of me.  ""@CAPS9 get the last house!"" I shouted at him. The house @CAPS9 was running to did not have their porch light on. @CAPS9 was running fast to the house and failed the see the step up in front of the door. I didn't expect what happened next. SMACK! @CAPS9 tripped over the step up and hit his face on the screen door. I could hear the slam from the middle of the dark street.  He got up quickly and turn to us in confusion ,""should I ring the door bell? Should I ring it?""  ""@CAPS23 run @CAPS9 I'm sure they would hear @CAPS21 smack their screen door with your face!"" @CAPS25 we got back to @CAPS15 house everyone was laughing. @CAPS9 @CAPS23 made our night. That happened @NUM3 years ago and I still remember it like it happened yesterday. So next time one of your friends ask @CAPS21 to ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS28"" a house think about if the porch lights are on. "	18	20	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3
20859	8	" ""@CAPS1 ma, do you know where my purse is."" I wonder where it is, I need to put my license in my wallet. I kept looking around and found it in my room under all my dirty clothes. A sigh of relief came over me, I was glad I found it before something happened. I woke up @DATE1 @TIME1 and figured it would be just another day. I had plans to go to a basketball game after school. It was the biggest game of the season, we were playing our rivals, the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The day was going by slow though, I couldn't wait until it was over. Finally the bell rang, school was over, I drove home a little disappointed. I wasn't sure if my friends were going to the game with me, if they didn't go I probably wouldn't either. I was determined though, I texted them at five and convinced them it would be fun. I picked up my friend @PERSON1 first, then @PERSON2.  This is when my normal day turned into one of the most eventful days ever. The @ORGANIZATION1 (where the game was being held) was about twenty minutes away, I had to stop and get gas before we left. We went to the cheapest spot in town and filled up my car. When it was time to leave, my car decided not to start. I have an old car and it doesn't start all the time, it just sits there for a while until it wants to start. There were some guys in the other lane that we new staring at us. We just started laughing it was really embarrassing. The attendant asked us if we needed something else and I said no, my car just wasn't starting. I tried turning it on again, but it just kept dieing. Out of all the other days my car decided not to start, today. Then some men came out and told me that they had to move my car I got so embarrassed and starting laughing again. I always laugh when I get nervous. I told them to let me try turning on my car once more, I prayed my car would turn on this time. It did, I was so relieved and embarrassed, I left as soon as I could.  Twenty minutes later we were in @ORGANIZATION1 in front of the school, and just my luck again, no parking spots. We drove around for about five minutes until we found one that was walking distance. Then we gathered our things and walked to the game. It hadn't started yet but it was about to, I had a feeling it would be a really close game. Soon the game began and just how I figured, the game kept going back and forth, we got a point, they got a point. It was really exciting but there where two parents behind us that were really into the game. They kept shouting at players, shouting at the referee, and just being annoying. The game was good, but in the end The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 won by @CAPS6 points. It was a little disappointing, but The @ORGANIZATION1 did have a good team.   After the game we were going to eat at @ORGANIZATION2. We left the game quickly after it was over so we wouldn't get stuck in traffic. I was driving down this road I thought I new but then I realized I didn't recognize it at all. @PERSON2 told me to keep going she new where we were. I stayed on the road and luckily it took us straight to down town by @CAPS7. I got onto one of the main roads and headed to @ORGANIZATION2. The road I was on had a million stop lights though, and I was stopping every @NUM1 minutes. Then a pedestrian decided to cross the street in front of me, I waited for him to cross even though he wasn't even on a crosswalk. I kept going no worries on my mind, music blasting, when suddenly rainbow lights behind me. This day couldn't get any worse, I pulled over and waited for the @CAPS8 to come up to my window. He asked for my license and registration. I got my purse and looked in my wallet. My heart pounded where was my license i had just put it in my purse a few days ago. I started to panic and laughter filled the air. My nerves got to me I couldn't help it. I looked everywhere finally he asked if I had my school I.D, I went to pull it out and there was my license right underneath. He went back to his car, leaving me bursting with laughter. He came back and told me my insurance was expired, another thing that added to my day. I was still laughing when he gave me my ticket for speeding and expired insurance. I think I got it because I was laughing and he thought I was taking it as a joke. You cant control nerves though, or at least I can't."	20	23		43				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	4	5	4						
20860	8	"                     Laughter is a key to any happy and successful relationship in my opinion. It can break the ice in an akward situation or help you become closer to someone. Some people have said that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and that laughter is the best medicine. I believe that both of those statements are true. Personally laughter has dramatically changed many different social situations throught my @NUM1 years of life.  One time in particular that I remember laughter really bringing me closer together with other people is when I was camping with a few of my friends. It was three years ago in the middle of @DATE1 and we were all sleeping outside under the stars. We had all been talking about pretty serious stuff, family and friend problems and just sharing our hardships in general with eachother. I didn't really have much to complain about, I had a pretty average family that I loved along with good friends. However that evening I was learning some interesting but disturbing information about my friends home life. She started to talk about how her parents don't care and how they are both alcoholics, I could tell by her tone of voice how painful admitting this information was for her. The mood had suddenly changed from discussing light issues to a serious, emotional conversation. She continued to tell me how alone she felt sometimes and how she just always wished she could be with her friends because we always have a good time.   After she told me all of this we laid in silence for a while. Neither of us were asleep but I had no idea what to say. I mean how could anything I say make that situation better or help her to feel better. While we had been having this conversation our other friend had run back to the car to grab sodas and go to the bathroom. We heard her saying our names and searching for us in the dark. All of a sudden she knew where we were, she had tripped over the edge of our sleeping bag fell on us and spilled a bunch of fizzy grape soda all over our faces. Normally we would have been angry but we all thought this was hysterical. While in the midst of laughing like crazy people I looked at my friend who had just recently told me her painful story, now she was crying from laughing so hard and I knew that a little laughter had brought us closer.  That is a memory that I will never forget, it was an experience where I feel laughter has played a major role in making a relationship more comfortable and close. Similar experiences have occured throughout my whole life. Laughter is a common ground, where all people can relate to one another. Maybe it brings people closer together because when you are legitimatley laughing you are so caught up in it that you forget about everything else. All of your problems disappear."	20	18	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	5	4	4	3

Especially when your dad had been in a huge motorcycle wreck and @CAPS4 had been waiting on him hand and foot the entire visit there.@CAPS10 had gone through a couple of surgeries and was put on a lot of medications for @CAPS2. I had noticed @CAPS10 was not really himself on all these pills. His abnormality was taking a toll on the family. Through all these stressful times, we were also worried about @CAPS6 stepmother. She was pregnant with her second child. There was also stress of having @CAPS6 fathers business being the main income, and him not being able to work. @CAPS6 father felt helpless, his leg was to weak for him to be doing anything.@CAPS10 would micromanage everything, and tell @CAPS4 were doing things all wrong. The was starting to cause a lot of tension within the house.  Today was the day. Isabelle (@CAPS6 little sister) and I were left alone with @CAPS6 with dad for the first time.I was going to the kitchen to get scissors for an art project we were doing in @CAPS6 room. Father asked asked if I could make him some oatmeal, of course with full hands I said ""@CAPS5, but I will when I'm done."" @CAPS6 father took that as disrespect, and hobbled over to me with his crutches. @CAPS10 was yelling at me which was upsetting, so instead of fighting back i headed to @CAPS6 room.The anger in his voice was excruciating. I turned around, told him to stop yelling, and headed back to @CAPS6 room. That's when it happened. @CAPS6 father hooked the end of a little kids chair and flung it down the hallway. It bounced off the walls, breaking an outlet shell, putting a hole in the wall, and hitting @CAPS6 knee. I didn't say anything, being afraid of what would happen next. Slamming the door luckily I had the phone and I called @CAPS6 grandmother. I told her on a voice mail that I wanted her to pick me up and take me to her house. She showed up an hour or so later not knowing I left a voice mail. I explained what happened, and she comforted @CAPS6 sister and I telling us it would be okay. @CAPS6 grandmother sat us all in the living room to try and resolve the situation. By then @CAPS6 dad had come to his senses and apologized to both of us. @CAPS10 used popcorn and candy to make us forgive him, then @CAPS10 started making fun, and jokes. Every time there is a fight or disagreeing @CAPS6 dad always cracks a few jokes to get us in a better mood. The one thing different this time is after @CAPS10 told some jokes, @CAPS10 apologized again. This time explaining why @CAPS10 was sorry. I liked that which made the rest of the day quite a joy.  "" @CAPS7 made laughter to be a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 medicine, @NUM1 minutes of laughter is equal to two hours of @CAPS2 @CAPS3."" @CAPS8 @CAPS9 on a @DATE1 service talked about this. Laughter can truly mend a broken heart. The @CAPS2 that @CAPS6 sister an I went through that day was all over after the laughter @CAPS6 father gave us. ""Laughter can save us."" @CAPS10 also stated. After this day I believe with a little humor @CAPS6 father an I's relationship can get through anything. I would never let one mistake control a life time bond. Laughter will always be in our hearts."	20	18		38				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4						
20883	8	"Being able to laugh, is one of the greatest feelings in the world. Having family to share it with is priceless. Family moments like that, are times no one can take away. They will be there for you to look back on and just smile on those days. Not being able to laugh would make this world dull and a very depressing place. Laughter is the main connection between family and friends.  My family and I decided that for our @DATE1 break we would drive to the great land of @LOCATION1. Not one of us @CAPS1 how to get there, but my mom told us she would figure it out and for us not to worry about it. So the day we were released from school my mom packed us up and off we went.After two long hours of driving we finally arrived at the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The crowd to get across was huge. On the boat to get across, I thought about going up stairs to see where we were at. There it was @LOCATION2.  Once we got off the boat and through the crowed highways of @LOCATION2, and started to make our way across the @LOCATION2/@CAPS4 border. I noticed that my mother had a weird look on her face, the look of worry. My sister asked her if she @CAPS1 what she was doing, she replied ""kinda"". After hours and hours of driving my mother thought it would be a good idea to just buy a map. When we looked at the map we noticed a little town that was very close. When we arrived my mom said we will stay here for the night. When we all woke up my mother told us that she remembered that the town we were staying in is the town we were suppose to be in. After driving around the town looking for our hotel, we were all in the room resting from driving around. My sister made a comment to my mom, about how funny it was to watch her drive around and act like she @CAPS1 what she was doing. This made all of us laugh. We all started to make random comments on her great navigation skills. The rest of the trip we drove around laughing and telling my mom, don't get lost this time, and ask for directions if you need them. laughing about us getting lost made the trip a truly unforgettable moment.   Being able to laugh, is the greatest feeling in the world. To do it with family is a great way to remember fun times. Not laughing could make this life horrible and dull. Being with family and taking a negative situation, and turning it into the best vacation ever with laughter is truly priceless.Everybody needs to laugh in their life,because you only live once so make it worth while."	20	16		36				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	3	3						
20889	8	" Laughing, smirking, giggling, @CAPS1 chuckling; these all have to do with one subject, @CAPS1 that is, laughing. Laughter is everywhere, you hear it in libraries, parks, at home, behind your back, @CAPS1 it can be a great thing or a horrible thing in @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 even with family @CAPS1 friends. Everyone has a past with laughing that has welcomed them, helped them out, cheered them up, or even, just so they can make a very special friend that will stay with them forever. It was the start of a brand new @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 I had just moved from @LOCATION2. I was a seventh grader about to start at @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 wasn't a real big fan of hanging out with people , so i stayed to myself most of the weeks, eating lunch in the guidance center, trying to figure out where books where without talking to anybody. My schedule was good, I had choir, art, drama, you know all the stuff I like. Art @CAPS1 drama were a blast, but when it came to choir @CAPS1 singing, my social level went down. I love to sing, but never did it in front of people. Then one day, I was walking to choir @CAPS1 I tripped @CAPS1 fell, my papers falling with me. My @ORGANIZATION1 work was all over the hall, math at one end, science at the other. But, out of all the kids in the hallway, only one laughed. She walked by @CAPS1 say I did a great job but something triggered her to come back. She helped me pick up all my math homework @CAPS1 picked up my schedule @CAPS1 saw that she too had choir this period. Her name was @PERSON1, she told me, @CAPS1 i told her my name, @CAPS1 we walked together. We sat next to each other @CAPS1 i sang with her ours voices in harmony. We talked in between periods, at lunch, on the bus ride home. We became great friends @CAPS1 the principal thought so too @CAPS1 he went ahead @CAPS1 gave us classes together. We were friends @CAPS1 we still are friends till this day. But the sad thing is is that she moved at the near end of eighth grade year. But she was the only friend I had for a little while @CAPS1 I always give her a call every now @CAPS1 then. Sometimes we can talk for hours, laughing @CAPS1 talking about how we are doing @CAPS1 when we are going to see each other again. She has been my best friend for at least two years now @CAPS1 it all happened by a slip of a foot, that falling of papers, @CAPS1 one little laugh from an amazing person. Laughing has got me so far in life @CAPS1 at @ORGANIZATION1. Every now @CAPS1 then, when i see someone, all alone, wanting a friend, I go @CAPS1 talk to them, @CAPS1 even laugh with them. One little laugh can trigger a huge friendship waiting to happen. Even if you don't think so, it does. Some say, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS1 I believe who ever said that because it happened to me."	20	19	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
20892	8	"  When it comes down to laughter, it can change a person's thinking or even the mood that @CAPS4 are in. Laughter can be the ending result, to a bad start to a day or to greater the relationship between two people. I love to laugh because it shows how I am feeling and it keeps me happy, I not only laugh when I'm sad, but also when I'm in a great mood as well. Growing up in a world full of tragedies and war, I feel like you should always keep your head held high and the smiles flowing. Although, when life gives you lemons, you must make lemonade and keep your face with the sour look because it's funny! I think that laughter is one of the best medicines around and can fix most problems whenever you are feeling down.  @CAPS2 older sister brought into this world the most amazing little nieces, an aunt could ever have. When @CAPS4 were little babies I used make silly faces, dance to @PERSON1 and watch movies with them, but this isn't what brought us closer. It was the fact that I wanted to laugh, in which made them happy too. One time, I was feeling really down and out, but I didn't want that to affect me, so I preceeded with @CAPS2 day and began to watch music videos, when ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3"", by @ORGANIZATION1 came on. @CAPS4 went crazy!, @CAPS4 started jumping on the bed and twirling their @CAPS3 back and forth as if @CAPS4 were @ORGANIZATION1!, @CAPS4 really stole the show. I couldn't believe before @CAPS2 eyes that this one happening, and I bursted out with so much joy. I felt so much of their joy, that I had to get up and dance with them, we jumped, we twirled, and whipped our @CAPS3 several times before the song ended with us dizzy and out of breath. After we had our fun of the music video, @CAPS4 just kept dancing and in @CAPS2 head I'm, like ""don't @CAPS4 ever get tired"", but I was pretty sure that their laughter brought them continouis amazement. A smile is worth a thousand words and laughter is priceless, @CAPS2 nieces really and are truly what brought me up that day. It was bitter in the start but then ended up sweet, lets just called it bittersweet. I feel like @CAPS2 nieces knew that I would be sad so @CAPS4 would say ""@CAPS5, what's wrong"", @CAPS5 being @CAPS2 nickname because I am very short. @CAPS4 would always find a way to make me feel the need to smile and have a good time. Me and @CAPS2 neices relationship has grown to the highest extent and I know that whenever I'm with them, I will laugh. If someone once said that ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", then @CAPS4 are correct because I @MONTH1 be in a different country, state or any other area but whether we talk on the phone or actually see each other, I will laugh about all their crazy antics and the closer we become as one.

20893	8	" Having laughter in your life is a big part in showing who you really are. Some people think that you @MONTH1 be one person who can be ""stuck up"" or a funny person who can really be ""stuck up"", but in the end your all laughing together no matter who they are. When you see something happen real funny you can't help but laugh. Or even when you get nervous all people do is laugh it off. All different kinds of people have different ways in showing how they can use laughter in their own lives. ""@CAPS1 are blue, roses are red, your always in my head, i want you in my bed...."" That's suppose to be a love poem. When your in a relationship with someone you might think your in love. If your partner is never open about anything, you probably don't have a great relationship. See if you can argue one moment with your lover then the next laugh it off because you were silly to be even discussing it. Your relationship involves love and laughter. Friendship is another great relationship for laughter. For example my friend and I were invited to a birthday party, she had lots of fun games and lots of food. My friend that went with me to the party her name is @PERSON1. It was gettting late, and we were tired. We were not doing anything this was probably around @NUM1 in the @TIME1. See us for some reason do love to sleep, but we were just having such a great time at our friends house we just didn't want the night to end at all.  We al sat and layed there on the ground and bed for about four hour earlier watching ""@CAPS2 A"". Then out of random i started to laugh at @LOCATION1, and till this day I don't know why i was laughing at her. All of the sudden she started to laugh a lot harder at me, then I was starting to laugh harder just because she was laughing. I was almost to the point where I couldn't breathe no more. So I got up walk my self to the bathroom, but i could still hear @CAPS3 laughter in the room which was still making me laugh.  Since that night @PERSON1 and I got a lot closer in our friendship. Laughter is a lot in life. It might make you feel like your dying sometimes, but that feeling is worth it."	17	20		37				3	4	3	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20898	8	" @CAPS6 only happened a few weeks ago on a day the all the students were supposed to be out having fun or sleeping because there was plenty of snow outside. A guy was crying on his chair with his hands over his eyes, a french horn in his lap and his gaze fixed on the ground below him. Sobs choked the sound in the band room but luckily for this guy's pride there weren't too many people in the room to start off with. The guy's head rose up, the tears seemed to eat the self sturdiness of his normal self, and @CAPS2 spoke to the person who always sat to his left. "" @CAPS1 just don't understand @PERSON2"" the broken, voice cracked on words ""I don't care that @CAPS1 play in cascade winds or that @CAPS1 get private lessons or that @CAPS1've gone to state honor band! This @MONTH1 sound like a terrible reason, but i just want to play first because i want to play first, and @CAPS1 never let us play first."" @CAPS2 was right about one thing, @PERSON2 really never let us play first. I somehow understood where @CAPS3 was coming from; @CAPS4 my freshman year i had always sat under him, and him under someone else and so forth. I had never seen him be first chair on anything. And now on his senior year, a prodigy child had come into band and she only knew how to fight for her position as first chair. In short @CAPS3's four hard years of working for the first chair spot in band were summed up to being second best the moment she stepped in the room. The feeling of all his hard work turned into mediocre in his face, with time, had broken him to tears.  @PERSON2 was much better than us and she has the accolades to prove @CAPS6. She had attended cascade winds solo ensemble festival, band camp, and would be going to @LOCATION1 as an ambassador of music. Still something about her having first part still didn't feel quite right. Maybe @CAPS6 was my sense of wanting superiority as well. @PERSON2 took in the words, leaned closer to say. "" I understand that @CAPS1 want first"" @CAPS10 with confident tones she said ""but right now we need specific players in specific spots. I've played harder music and my skills are whats needed on first part. I understand what your feeling, ive been there before.""  @CAPS6 struck me weird that a sophomore was telling this to a senior. How could she have felt what @CAPS2 was feeling? she'd been a prodigy child in @CAPS7 @CAPS8 from the start. I sided with @PERSON1 but @CAPS10 I realized that letting him play a more demanding part would be worse for the band. So i tried siding with @PERSON2 but @CAPS10 all i could think about was that this was @PERSON1's last year to shine as a @CAPS7 @CAPS8 french horn player.They kept going at eachother. Every comment scraping at the already fragile surface of the argument. Minutes made the quarrel more and more volatile.  I had to think faster. @CAPS9 the argument continued like this the horn section would be torn apart and co-operation would be useless. More importantly I would lose two partners that together had uprooted a great deal of musical talent. I slid my chair next to them to tell them my thoughts. ""@CAPS9 a man has no socks,"" I liked starting out my thoughtful speeches with mysterious beginnings, "" @CAPS10 so will..."".And that's as far as i got. I thought @CAPS6 was brilliant, their faces said otherwise. So they called me crazy and giggled @CAPS10 they made fun of me and laughed. Thankfully i was oblivious of the stuff they called me because i really wanted to remember what i wanted to say. @CAPS3 stopped crying, finally, and @PERSON2 got my message that @CAPS3 was a senior and didn't really have many more chances at playing first chair in @CAPS7 @CAPS8 band. They settled the fight with a simple deal; @CAPS3 would get fist chair as soon as we stopped competing. @CAPS4 @CAPS10 I've been the center of being made fun of. But as annoying as @CAPS6 gets sometimes its usually funny for everyone, including myself.  I cant even begin to imagine what band would be like @CAPS9 their enmity had risen to the no forgiveness zone. There had been times before when heated discussions left the stress levels in our section so @CAPS7 @CAPS6 made @CAPS6 hard to breath right. Having laughter come in even right before they were about to rip eachother's faces off gave them time to understand that they had mutual understanding of each other. Or opened their eyes to how long they're going to have to sit next to each other i they were to continue fighing. Either way, @CAPS6's definatley changed the way they feel about eachother; I haven't heard them complian about one another for a while. @CAPS3 is eagerly awaiting his turn to shine and @PERSON2 for better or worse can't wait to see him play."	23	21		44				5	5	5	5	5	4	5	4	5	4	4	4						
20900	8	" Everyone loves to laugh; I don't think everyone understands the effect laughter can have on two people though. For example, there can be two complete strangers, who have never seen each other before in their life; as soon as they start laughing they could become good friends. You'll never know how close you can be with someone if you don't ever sit down and talk, laugh, and get to know them. You could go your whole life being at @CAPS4 with just a minute amount of friends but then there could be @NUM1 other classmates you've never talked to that could also become your friends, too. I'm sure just getting to know one another would make a difference in someones life because for me there has been many situations where laughing has made an impact on my relationship with someone; especially with my best friend, @PERSON1. When I first met my friend @PERSON1 we didn't know each other at all but laughing broke the ice. A simple laugh made us comfortable and everything was less awkward. As soon as we started laughing more and more, we couldn't stop; the rest was history. I went to elementary @CAPS4 with @PERSON1 for @NUM2 years and never talked to her but then when we got into @NUM3 grade we started hanging out with the same people and started talking more. By @NUM4 grade we began to hang out outside of @CAPS4 and talking, sharing secrets, and having sleep overs. But ""breaking the ice"" isn't the only impact laughing can have on a relationship. When I'm with @PERSON1, I know I can trust her and everything is fun. We always have conversations to talk and laugh about. You could say it made us closer. By the time @NUM5 grade came we were best friends, we had sleepovers every single weekend at one anothers house. When the @DATE1 before our @NUM6 grade year at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 came we were spending weeks at each others houses. There wasn't a day that went by that we weren't together, talking, or making plans over the @DATE1 to hang out. Now, we can be ourselves around each other; we can always have a good time. Making people closer is just a small part of the effects that just one laugh can do to two people. When I'm sad about something @PERSON1 makes everything better; also vise versa; I make her feel better, too. We always have each others back. I know we will always be there for each other; I'll always have a shoulder to cry on. We have become such close friends that when @PERSON1 was having problems at home she needed a place to live in order for her to not have to go to The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, so she moved in with me! It has been the most fun living with her. We thought we would start to argue and not be as close since we would always be together and probably get annoyed of each other but we haven't. @PERSON1 and I can hang out @NUM7 and always be together; it's like having another sister.  @PERSON1 and I are super close, and she plans to stay living with me for the rest of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 until we graduate. It's amazing to think us being best friends and tremendously close, living together, always being together, and being totally comfortable with each other on everything just started out with a simple laugh when we first started talking in the @NUM3 grade. This is why I believe that just laughing can make two strangers, that have never even spoken, can turn into being the closest of friends."	22	20		42				4	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20906	8	"Trust is a huge deal between friends. Friends agree on the same things, say an honest opinion about it, and don't lose the trust between a great friendship. You never know who can stay by you with a full amount of trust between you two.When you trust a friend you depend on them to keep things between each other. Just like my friends and I. We agreed on telling each other everything that has happened and not to lie about anything. We agreed on everything based on trust. Our friendship has always been great with not lying to each other. Telling each other how we feel about certain things. Then we put all our opinions together and come up with a solution that we all agree on. That's why you should depend each other like a team. When you break a trust between a friend, you probably won't get the same trust you had before. You don't really get told anything as much as you use to. An it's like you never should have lost the trust with a friend. You don't seem to be the same because you aren't trusted that much. You get told it was your fault lying or for any reason to be not trusted. Like this one time one of friends didn't tell me the whole truth of what she was doing behind my back. Till I found out what she was doing I lost most of my trust with her. She's not trusted as much she was before, but we are still friends.That's why having trust is a big deal in a friendship or any kind of relationship. You learn to trust each other in different ways, get to know each other more by having the trust between you and other person. You get a lot more attention when you have that trust with other people. You don't seem like you are left out on anything. You see that you can trust more people to when you get to know them. Who knows that you have trust for another person who isn't your best friend.So we all know that trust is a huge deal between two people or maybe even more. You need to work together for the trust. Have a good friendship or relationship to anybody as long as there is trust between you guys. My friends and I have learned a lot from trusting each other in different ways."	24	20		44				5	4	4	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20909	8	" Laughter, everyone from babies to old people do it. Laughter is an element that helps in life. They say that ""laughter is the best medicine"" it truly is. Laughing lets people know that you have a good sense of humor and that you like to have fun and let loose. In any friendship, relationship, job or sport you need to laugh every once in a while. You can't always be serious. Being serious @NUM1 as they say is not good, it makes people seem like they don't know how to enjoy life or they have no sense of humor.  In the @DATE1 I had a rough volleyball season. A lot of my teammates had problems with me, because I was chosen as captain along side my friend @PERSON1. We weren't the most well liked, but we were liked by some. It was hard for @PERSON1 and I to prove that we were right for the position of captains and that we could lead the team. A few of my teammates at the time quit because they did not want to deal with @PERSON1 and I being captains, but as they quit we moved people from junior varsity up to varsity. The new varsity members had it rough, they struggled a bit trying to get the hang, but they did it they managed to get the hang of how varsity plays and practices. Soon after our mishap of having to replace seven out of fourteen players we had our first game. The game was one of the toughest we had the whole season. In our first set of the we didn't exactly have our minds in it for the first of what would be come a five set, game. We battled back and forth a few points in the first set, but we ended up losing that first set. We went into the second set not knowing what we were going to do whether to give up or half-@CAPS1 it was tough, I as one of the captains said ""@CAPS1, we won't get anywhere unless we @CAPS1."" then @PERSON1 says ""I agree, lets @CAPS1 our best and not let them get an easy win."" We did exactly that we tried and we won that second set. It was the third set and we had started to get tired and feel aggravated, so we pushed forward we won the third set. One more set and we would win it. We went on the court and the ball was served we let the ball hit the ground point one to the other team. After that first point it went down hill we let them get the best of us and they won the set. It had come down to the fifth and final set were we would either win or lose. We got on the court knowing that we might lose and started. The first point went to us we went back and forth a ton in the final set. It was a tough battle, but we had done it we won. Later in the season we met the team again and it was a hands down battle we had lost the second time we met them it was not easy at all they didn't allow any room for errors on their behalf, but us we let it all slip. It was time for the state playoffs we had made it to the state finals. The team we were playing was the team we had faced twice before and we were one and one. The line-up was called, national anthem sang, and the coin was flipped, we would receive the serve. The game was in full swing, we were doing great we won the first set by four a tough first game. We went into set two, we lost control. We didn't do what we were suppose to do. We lost the second set it was and confidence hitter. We were down we didn't know what to expect in set three, and as captains the team seeing @PERSON1 and I should have not let ourselves be down. We looked at each other with that look I knew and we just busted out laughing we couldn't stop the team wondered what was wrong. So we explained that in order to win we had to laugh we @MONTH1 feel down, but you have to laugh and the team did we went into the third set confident as ever and we won we didn't stop there we went into the fourth set and won. We had done what we set out to do win! In the end laughing was what we needed to do we had come this far that we could either give up or push and succeed. We looked at the two previous games that we had met the other team before and laughed. We made that our team motto ""laugh until you cry, and cry until you laugh"" the season was great looking back on it we were state champs. Now in @DATE2 season we are hoping to repeat state champs."	17	17		34				4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3						
20913	8	" Laughter  @CAPS1 brings enthusiasm and joyfulness to any means or matter. Have you ever thought of laughter being a part or key element in a relationship? A time when laughter has really helped or made a relationship is when I met one of my still today best friends. I had just started fifth grade at a new school; I transferred from private to public. There was only a couple of people I knew there because of family, and these people were my cousins. As you can imagine I sat by the people whom I known for most of my life, and being in this position was very awkward. So, eventually at the end of the day I was ready to leave school and it was my first time I ever got to walk home since this school was much closer than my last. I had to walk home with a kid who lived right by me; this I had never known because of my sheltered young life. Luckily he was easy to talk to and we both had something in common which was skateboarding. This is when we started @CAPS1 because we talked about certain falls we had which were not so pleasant and he asked if we could hang out after school, and with me as a shy guy I said okay. After awhile, he came over with his skateboard and he told me to go down this ramp I had. So, I did and fell right on my back which we both thought was hilarious and we started @CAPS1 together. This @CAPS1 we did since walking home really made me feel comfortable with him and kind of bonded us. I feel that fall was a key part of our friendship because it made the awkwardness go right out the window and helped us start talking about more funny thing which we had seen. Ever since, every time we hang out something happens and we laugh as hard as you can imagine which goes down in our memories as good times. @CAPS1 has always ""sweetened the mood"" so to say and always makes a good time a great time to remember or to a truly boring time to a ""lets go do something"" time. Also, in any situation when I have been @CAPS1, or start to laugh, I feel good because every one laughs when I laugh. Most of my friends are also my friends because of my laughs and times I make them laugh. All in all, most of the relationships I have are because of @CAPS1 and how they comfort two or even more people by bonding them, and making every one feel like their having a good time with each other. This is key because than most encounters with people, even friends can be very awkward or not enjoyable. So, really in any case @CAPS1 is necessity because than every thing would be dull, plus you would really have no one to be able to have an appreciative time with. Therefore, every time I meet someone new or even someone I know laughter needs to exist in order to have a relationship with anyone."	15	19	34	34				3	3	4	3	3	3	5	4	5	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	3	3
20915	8	" @CAPS11 was @DATE1, hot and dry hadn't seen any @CAPS26 for a few miles. We'd been walking for a good six hours now @CAPS18 snacking on left over jerky scraps. @PERSON3 hadn't said much today still pissed off about dropping the can-tine, I would've laughed if the duration of our lives weren't depending on that can-tine. Hadn't heard even a grain of sand shift along the dead dry dirt that day under the blistering sun. No wind no nothing. I looked up the sun was at @CAPS11's peak yet @CAPS11 felt like a few weeks had already gone by. Finally gaining the courage to crack open my wrinkled bloodied lips I managed to sputter something, ""@CAPS1 sound good right about now, @CAPS3't you think?"" @CAPS2 didn't even glance over at me, I couldn't tell if @CAPS2 was @CAPS18 ignoring me or that @CAPS2 was sun burnt so bad his skin would tear @CAPS18 turning his head. ""@CAPS3't make me start singin, you know how bad I'm at singin. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 left me after I started singin to her."" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS4 so I go'n die by myself? Make things better?"" @PERSON3 finally speaking up, surprisingly with his neck still intact. ""@CAPS5 wasn't so bad, @CAPS18 try to imagine that can-tine @CAPS31 had whiskey in @CAPS11. Know how much you hate @CAPS11, yeah?"" I asked kicking a rock. ""@CAPS4 did I ever start riding with you and them outlaws, should've @CAPS18 stayed back home become a lawyer at least make a name for myself."" @CAPS2 muttered looking away. ""@CAPS8 you did, now we can go on ahead or you can go on back that way and get lynched. Maybe go ask @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION2's body back by the rocks, give you another reminder of @CAPS9'll happen back down that way."" I gazed into the distance not much to see, except a small brown dot couldn't tell @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was. ""@CAPS9 you reckon that is?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS10 some dead animal."" @CAPS11 had been a few hours since we talked, the brown dot getting a little bit bigger as we drew closer. I still couldn't make out @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was, but I knew @CAPS9 I hoped for @CAPS11 to be. My boots began wearing out a few years ago now revealing a gaping hole of which my big toe couldn't resist sticking out of. ""We're out of jerky, all gone."" @PERSON3 grunted as @CAPS2 tossed the sack over his shoulder. ""@CAPS9 do you think that is anyway?"" @CAPS2 spatted. ""@CAPS3't know but @CAPS11's pretty big and @CAPS29 sun is mighty hot, I reckon @CAPS11's got some nice shade under @CAPS11."" @CAPS11 was nearly dusk, but the dot had grown remarkably larger a mile or so away from @CAPS11 now. ""@CAPS11's getting dark, how we goin see where we steppin?"" @PERSON3 asked watching every step. ""@CAPS17 that hard to walk without lookin."" ""@CAPS18 think of @CAPS11 like @CAPS19 the tail on the donkey but having to walk to the donkey blindfolded."" ""@CAPS20, @ORGANIZATION1 sure knew how to through a party, her pies were mighty fine."" @PERSON3 began fantasizing. Now walking with my arms stretched afar I'd knew if we we're at the object. I retracted my big toe through the hole as to restrain from stubbing @CAPS11 on a rock. Suddenly I heard a loud thud, then I felt something smooth, ""I think we @CAPS28 @CAPS11,"" @PERSON3 said slowly, I now realizing @CAPS9 that thud was. ""@CAPS21 be some abandoned jeep."" ""@CAPS9 we going to do with @CAPS11?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS23."" @CAPS24 up over the door onto the front seats the cushioning was firm but comfortable enough to call a bed. I woke to yet another hellish sun in the sky almost laughing down on us. There were a few compartments in the jeep that I began to search through for @CAPS26. ""@CAPS9 you looking for?"" @PERSON3 sighed as @CAPS2 slopped out of the jeep. ""@CAPS26, @CAPS9 else?"" @CAPS27 searching through old dusty papers I managed to find a rock hard piece of gum, a cigar stub, and a half empty bottle of @CAPS9 I'd hoped to be @CAPS26. Oh @CAPS9 I'd given for that bottle to have been filled with @CAPS26. Whiskey was all that I @CAPS28 inside the bottle. Getting out of the dirty automobile I @CAPS28 @PERSON3 sitting against the front tire. ""@CAPS28 some of that favorite drink of yours,"" I said sitting down against the door. ""@CAPS29 all you find?"" @PERSON3 muttered. ""@CAPS30."" I starred out at the horizon, nothing but sand. ""I'm scarred, you scarred?"" @PERSON3 asked looking over to me. ""@CAPS31 thing that scares me is the times @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 caught me snacking on her pies before supper,"" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS20, that is true,"" @PERSON3 laughed as @CAPS2 wiped drips of sweat off his brow. We @CAPS18 sat there for a few days, @CAPS18 starring and joking. @PERSON3 was a pretty swell guy, @CAPS11's a shame I brought him into all of @CAPS29. @CAPS2 died of a heat stroke. That desert was harsh and unforgiving, @CAPS11's something I'll have to carry forever."	18	20	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
20920	8	" In my storie I am going to tell you about a funny time in my life where me, and my brother liked to pull pranks on my aunt.   @CAPS1 first paragraph is about the first prank that we pulled on my aunt. when i was about six and my brother was four and my aunt had just bought a beautiful purple suade couch, she loved @CAPS1 couch, and me and my brother at the time thought that my aunt had loved @CAPS1 couch more then she loved us. So me and my little brother took two jugs of chocolate syrup, and poor them all over my aunts brand new three thousand dollar couch.    The second prank was just myself, and one day i was playing video games and my aunt was getting ready for work. I was getting very frustrated with the game and i threw my controller down, man my aunt ran over and pop me in the back of my head so fast,and she told me to be a good sport and try it again. But i was upset because i just got popped in the back of my head so i was looking for some revenge, when my aunts goes into the bathroom to go put in her make-@CAPS3 for work, I go into the kitchen and get a grape soda, I walk over to my aunts purse crack open the grape soda and poor it all over the inside of my aunts purse.  The last paragraph is about the worst prank that me and my little brother have ever pulled. One morning when my aunt was at work and my dad was sleep, me and my little brother were sitting on the couch watching television and my little brother says that he has to go to the bathroom and knowing us kids we do everything together so me and my brother go @CAPS3 stairs to the bathroom, and we see the biggest box of fifty-four rolls of soft, lushes toilet paper.Me and my little brother love toilet paper rolls for whatever reason, so we open the box and my brother drops one in the toilet, so I put one in the toilet, then he puts another one in the toilet, then i flush it. Little did we know that it would back fire at us and the toilet started to over flow, but i kept flushing. Then i get another roll and start unwrapping it all over the floor, the my brother gets one and @DATE1 we are knees deep in toilet paper and water. Then our aunt walks through the front door, we don't here her because we are having so much fun in toilet paper and water, then she comes @CAPS3 stairs, goes to the bathroom too see me and my brother and a bathroom thrashed, full of toilet paper and water. But the only thing that she says to us is. CLEAN @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4! She slams the door then me and my brother look at eachother then start cleaning. Then finally after hours of cleaning the bathroom is back to the way it should be.   @CAPS1 is the conclusion of my storie about the three worst pranks that me and my little brother have pulled on our aunt.

20924	8	"Laughter Laughter can make a situation less uncomfortable, bring two people together or just show your having a good time. In my experiences laughter comes at the best of times. On a typical @ORGANIZATION1 day at @ORGANIZATION1 I was sitting with my friends at lunch time just hanging out talking about whats going on in our lives, when I notice a girl sitting all alone. I don't recognize her, she must be a new student. I ask around to see if anyone knows anything about her; no one knows. Looking back at the girl she looks very lonely and in need of a friend. Curious to meet someone new I walk over to her and make conversation after a little while we relax and start to talk about our interests. I remember her saying something funny and I started to laugh, she begins to laugh at my laugh being as its almost hysterical sounding and everyone thinks it sounds ridiculous. At that moment as were sitting there laughing together I realize, its bringing us together making us closer despite the fact we had just met but ten minutes ago.  Laughter makes life more enjoyable and happy knowing that you can share that with someone you have just met or someone you have known your whole life is magical. Its a universal language that everyone should speak. Laughing is healthy and good for the heart."	15	14		29				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	3	3						
20926	8	" We were heading to our first ski race. On either side of me, my friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 sat, crammed together in our team van. Our packed bags and ski gear filled the vehicle to the top, along with six other kids, occupying all of the other empty spaces. Our uncomfortable seating arrangements didn't seem to ruin our fun, within five minutes of our road trip, the van exploded with laughter, as @PERSON1, most likely a future comedian started off cracking jokes, just being himself as usual. Within those first five minutes of our drive, I could already tell that this was going to be a ski trip I would always remember.  The van rolled up to the hotel parking lot. My ski team would be lodging here for the long weekend. The sky had turned black with the @TIME1, and me along with everyone else trudged along with weary eyes, exhausted from the long drive. We quickly unloaded our bags, all eager to hop into our beds, needing to be well rested for our first ski race of the season. Shortly after, everyone was soon in bed, knowing that five a.m. would be coming quickly. The sun began rising over the mountains, signaling time to wake up. This was not the case for me. I had been up for nearly an hour, and sat in our van while we sped around each corner up to the mountain. It was race day, and me, along with all of my teammates were all excited for the day coming. The morning flew by, collecting our bibs at registration, getting our lift tickets, and inspection of the course. I now stood at the top of the hill peering down at the course ahead of me. I had to focus. While I have had a lot of fun, it was time to concentrate, to preform my absolute best. The pressure was on. I now stood in the start gate, my coach stood by my side, and my friends were watching as well, cheering me on. I was hoping not to disappoint. ""@CAPS2 ready,"" the official began in a tense voice, ""@CAPS3!"" I threw my self our of the start gate. I flew by each gate, staying in control and most important, going fast. The wind slid past my aerodynamic body, my ankles and knees rolled with each turn. Everything was going well until I broke over the knoll. My body compressed bringing my knees to my chest, as I skied over the roller, throwing me off balance. I fought to get back up, to regain myself, but I couldn't do it. My skis spun out from under me, causing me to be spit out from the course, landing on my back, sliding down the mountain, hopeless and done for. It was over. I sat in the snow frustrated with my performance. I wanted a second chance that I wasn't going to get. @PERSON1, one of my teammates, came up to me and sat in the snow by my side. My first thought was he was going to say something of a cliche ""nice job,"" or a ""you'll do better next time"". To my surprise he tells me one of his ridiculous jokes. My mouth turns up, trying to contain a laugh, unsuccessful, I burst into laughter. @PERSON1 sits there and smiles at me. Almost immediately I found myself in a better mood. I give him a quick ""thanks,"" with a smile before we both @CAPS3 to watch and cheer on our teammates. Although I didn't do my best, I didn't let my results ruin my weekend. The next day, I skied two solid runs with top finishes, if I had stayed upset with myself, I would have never been able to achieve those results. I came to realize that some days, just a small laugh can be all you need to turn any day around. Laughter, I have found is essential in any situation. It's a connection that can bring anyone closer. For me, laughter changed my personality that day on the mountain. Laughter can mean many different things for many different people, laughter could be a special bond between to people. Laughter can remove the seriousness or competitively in a situation, but also it unites us. Languages are different among people, but everyone understands a what a laugh can do, a laugh is universal."	24	23		47				4	5	4	4	5	5	5	4	5	5	4	5						
20931	8	" Some people say that laughter is good for the soul, and that could be true, but the soul is definitely not the only thing. Laughing is great for your heart and mind too. It can improve relationships, make friendships grow stronger, and even start @CAPS5 make two people who don't know anything about each other, extremely close. You can meet someone new or be with someone you barely know, and just because they make you laugh you feel like you want @CAPS5 get @CAPS5 know them better. I love that feeling. Honestly, you can laugh with any age or gender. You don't both have @CAPS5 be @NUM1 and female, you could be with a little boy, an elderly lady, or anywhere in between and still have a lot of fun. Last @DATE1 I never had anything @CAPS5 do, so I decided I should start volunteering places. The two places I could volunteer at were: a daycare next @CAPS5 my house, or an old folks home about @NUM2 miles away. I thought really hard about it, trying @CAPS5 make the best decision for me. I couldn't make up my mind, and even though I didn't admit it, I felt like they would be just as boring as sitting at home. I finally decided I should do both of them, so I could meet some new people, and have new experiences. I started with the daycare. I woke up at @NUM3 am, and walked @CAPS5 @ORGANIZATION1. I wasn't sure what it was going @CAPS5 be like at all. I didn't even know if i was good with kids. I walked in, and stood @CAPS3 awkwardly. The @ORGANIZATION1 manager came up @CAPS5 me and asked me if i could help out with the @NUM4 year old's coloring room. I nodded my head nervously.  Was i supposed @CAPS5 color for them? @CAPS3's no way they could color a picture by themselves. They're only three! I thought. Oh well, if i follow directions then this day will get @CAPS2 faster. When i went in @CAPS3 all the kids ran up @CAPS5 me with a smile on their face. ""@CAPS1 by me!"" one said. ""@CAPS2 here!"" said another. ""@CAPS3's a spot right here!"" ""@CAPS4 at my picture!"" ""I drew a rainbow!"" ""I drew a car!"" ""I drew you!"" @CAPS5 that, i looked down. @CAPS3 i was, on the piece of paper. A bunch of blue and green scribbles. That day was a lot of fun. I was laughing and having a great time with the kids. I learned that i absolutely adore kids, and I'm actually pretty good with them. The next week a went @CAPS5 the nursing home. I was even more nervous @CAPS3. I felt so out of place. I hadn't found out what I was going @CAPS5 be helping with yet, so I sat on a chair in the lobby. When the receptionist asked who i was her @CAPS5 see, i said nobody. She then asked me why I was here, and I replied, oh, I was going @CAPS5 volunteer. She led me down the hall told me that it was almost time for lunch so i needed @CAPS5 get ready @CAPS5 serve lunch. I did, and then the i heard, what i assumed was, the lunch bell. I gave everyone their lunch with a big smile and it was honestly great. If one of them looked a little down, or upset I could flash them a smile and they would grin back, obviously in higher spirits than before. After lunch, I played a few games of chess. Most people who were @CAPS3 took naps after lunch, so @CAPS3 were only three people out @CAPS3. I played first with a lady who used @CAPS5 be a nurse. I got @CAPS5 know her pretty well in the half hour we played the game; which i won. Next was a guy who was a veteran. He fought in the @LOCATION1 war. He seemed really nice, but serious. I won that game too. The last man used @CAPS5 be a comedian. He was so funny. He told jokes the whole game! Maybe he said a few @CAPS5 many, because he beat me at chess. Well that was my excuse. When i got done, i was in a great mod and i could't wait @CAPS5 come back again. I learned a lot that @DATE1. I found out everyone is alike in some ways, even though each person is unique. I realized you don't have @CAPS5 be the same as the person your with, @CAPS5 laugh and have a good time. It doesn't matter what age, race, gender, size, mentality, maturity, etc. The only thing that matters is that you are in the same place at the same time, trying @CAPS5 make the best of your day. I am so glad i decided @CAPS5 volunteer, otherwise i would have never known so much about people, love, life, and laughter."	20	21		41				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	5	4	4	4						
20942	8	"A @ORGANIZATION1 is a wondrous gift. It allows your mind and your body to conjoin with others. It is the root of happiness, and brings a sense of sanity to those who have lost hope. When you feel alone in the world with no one at your side, laughter will be there to accompany you. At one point in my life I felt confused and by myself. I was empty. Solitude was the only thing I could have, and the only feeling my mind would register. Just when I had thought that I @MONTH1 be the only person in the whole world, something had come to save me.  I was six years old when they got divorced. I couldn't stand to hear my parents fight. One day we were the perfect family. We would play board games and go to the movies together. Something had changed very quickly. My @CAPS1 grabbed his jacket, told me he loved me and then he was gone. Was I ever going to see him again? Why isn't @CAPS1 living with us? These are questions I kept asking myself. I think i was too young to truly know what was going on. The days were long and I found myself becoming sluggish and glum.  About two weeks after my @CAPS1 had left, some neighbors moved into the house adjacent to me and my mom. One of the neighbors looked young, about my age. I didn't think much of the new people in town. I told myself that people come and go. Nothing lasts forever, and I should expect the worst. One day I was riding my bike and thought that I should stop pedaling and crash into my fence. I hit the metal fence and simply fell over. I heard a laugh and turned around. It was the new neighbor kid. There he was rolling on the ground, grabbing at his sides. He must have thought of my crash as entertainment. I picked up my bike, began to move, then crashed once more. Another series of laughs sprang from this boy. That was the first time I had smiled in a long time. I grew fond of whatever feeling or humor I was giving off to this new kid. I asked the boy his name and he didn't respond; though he did start to laugh again. It was my voice that he was laughing at. Everything I did caused him to become hysterical. I found out later that he was from @LOCATION1 and didn't speak a word of @CAPS2. Over the course of a month or so, I felt the hole in my heart begin to fill. My new companion and his laugh was the start to my new beginning. My mom and I eventually moved out of our house and lost contact with the neighbors. I am always reminded of him when I hear a laugh. Though he's not near me in a physical sense, I am guided by his laughter every day."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	4	4						
20948	8	" During the @CAPS1 break my family went to @LOCATION4 except for my older brother. We were head to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4. The ride there was long but we made it. When I woke up at my grandparents house there was already snow! I was very excited. They got about six to eight inches of snow. We rested before we went out to enjoy the snow. Later while I was outside I got a visit from old friends of mine. I hadn't seen them since @DATE1. We talked and hung out. They told me that I was lucky to get out of school early for @CAPS1 break. They still had to got to school. I told them that if they're lucky then they would have to go to school for only half of the week. And they did get lucky. @DATE3 they went to school and the rest of the week they got off because the roads were icy. I was very happy that they got the rest of the week off, now we were able to actually hang out during the break. That night my grandma made us some barbeque chiken, scalloped potatoes, green beans and corn, and rolls. It was really good. I love my grandmas cooking and she's the head chef at the school that she works at. She is an amazing cook! @DATE2 was a very cold day. My friends invited me to go shoot air soft guns. It would me my first time. Being with my friends again was fun. While I was trying to shoot an air soft gun, my friend @PERSON6 told me that I was shooting it wrong. ""@CAPS3 am I shooting it wrong?"" I asked him. He told me that he didn't really know and that I suck at shooting. I reminded him that it was my first time. Then he put his arms around me to try to help me aim better. It was very awkward but I was a little frustrated. Sometimes I hate it when people try to help me when I don't want it. And that was one of the time. But he was one of my good friends so it wasn't too bad. When we were done, @PERSON6 asked my to hold onto his air soft gun while he was getting something. He had also told me that the safety was on. So while I was waiting, I was spinning the gun on one of my fingers and somehow I shot him in the back. He freaked out a little bit and asked why I shot him.  ""I didn't mean too. I was spinning the gun on my finger and somehow I shot you! Pluse you said that the safety was on!"" @PERSON6 forgave me and told me that it wasn't my fault because it wasn't. He saw that our friends @NUM1, @PERSON3, @LOCATION3, @PERSON1 were laughing and so was my cousin @PERSON4. @CAPS4 confesed that he was the one that shot @PERSON6 in the back. So @PERSON6 decide that he was going to shoot @CAPS4 back. Then somehow it beacame an all out shooting between all of us. I had lots of fun that day. It's one of my favorite memories when I was there. While I was still in @LOCATION4, my @CAPS5 @DATE4 asked if I can babysit for her. So the next day after lunch I let my little cousin @PERSON2 play in the backyard after he was done eating. My baby cousin @PERSON5 was taking a nap so I told @PERSON2 that we can't be to loud. I decide to go play outside in the snow with him. After we were done we decided to go back into the house. We got locked out. Then I remembered that @TIME1 when my @CAPS5 was still home, @PERSON2 was messing with the lock. So I decided to go around the house and try the front door. It was locked too. @PERSON2 told me that the garage door can open, but he didn't know the code. I felt really stupid. After a couple minutes more we went over to one of their neighbors house so that I can call my @CAPS5 because I didn't have her cell phone number. But the neighbor only had their house number. Then I called my dad so that I can get her number. I told him what happend and he started to laugh. @PERSON5 was still taking her nap so things were still kind of ok. I called my @CAPS5 and we waited until she got home. She told me that it was ok and it happend to her twice while @PERSON5 was taking a nap. She also said that sometimes before she goes outside she takes a key with her of makes sure that the door was unlock. I learned a little lesson that day. But other than that @PERSON2 and I had fun outside.  I had such a great time while I was in @LOCATION4. Just being in @LOCATION4 is one of my favorite places to be. Espicially when I'm with my friends and family."	19	20	40	40				3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4

20957	8	" Each person filed in, one after the other, making a human train. The metallic red bell chimed once as each person pushed the door slightly more open. Walking in, I was enveloped by the smell of @CAPS1 food and conversations that hummed in my ears. I took a few steps forward and stopped, not knowing where to go. To the right was a wall covered in @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 symbols and meanings, while to the left were hundreds of tables already filled. Not knowing where to take my place, I turned to my mom. I so badly wanted to plop myself down at one of the adult tables, even if it meant I had to sit there silently. With moms knowing what's best, she shoved me towards the back of the restaurant, telling me to go sit with my cousins. I did as she told me, like always, but made my reluctance clear. Walking over to the table with the speed of a slug and my feet dragging on the floor, I awkwardly stood in front of the circular table. Yanking out one of the chairs, I turned to my mom with a pleading look as desperation filled every fiber of my body, for I knew there was no way she would give in. Staring at these six relatives, I didn't know how I could manage to sit here the rest of the evening.  We had all gathered at a @CAPS1 restaurant for my grandpa's @NUM1 birthday. Each of his children had flown from the mainland to @LOCATION1 in order to spend this special moment with him. I hadn't seen these cousins for over @NUM2 years, and some much longer. I had already visited with them since we'd been in @LOCATION1, but I hadn't talked to them much, none the less when we were all together and forced to mingle.  With my napkin on my lap, I sat and looked at my cousins, each one staring back at me like I was an animal at the zoo. After a moment or two, they seemed to forget I was there because they averted their gaze and began talking amongst themselves. The only person at the table who I didn't feel like a complete stranger towards was my cousin, @PERSON2. She had wavy brown hair with blindingly blond highlights, sun-kissed from those bright tropical days, along with that brown @CAPS6 skin that made me jealous. We began talking, and soon I found myself enjoying the moment.  It wasn't until the food came that we actually began interacting as a group. Being teenagers with bland palates, everyone stared as the waiter brought the first dish. After asking the friendly waitress what it was we were about to eat, from her broken @CAPS7 we deciphered that they were buns with duck inside. Frantically trying to get all of the tables served in fairly constant intervals, she left our table and all of us looked at our food blankly. No one wanted to take the first bite. One of my cousins, @PERSON1, stepped up to take the masculine role as the dare devil. We all waited tentatively as he chomped down on the moist bun and swallowed. Once done chewing, he smiled and it seemed this dish had won his approval. Digging into my buns, I began to wonder if maybe these people were easy to relate to and I had made a small thing into a big ordea. From then on, I would just be myself and stop worrying about not having seen anybody for years; All I needed was to be myself.  The way the courses were set up left plenty of time to chat between each plate they brought. Since I was no longer worrying about what to say or how to say it, I easily fit into the conversations and began to relax. Shortly after the duck tray was removed from the table, it was discovered that my cousin @PERSON1, who is from @LOCATION2, pronounces certain words with an accent. Soon everybody began comparing the way we pronounce things to the way that he does. After each difference we found, we would chuckle. Things carried on like that for the rest of the @TIME1, everyone laughing at things that were only moderately funny, but we found hilarious.  It was that @TIME1 when I realized, even though you @MONTH1 be uncomfortable around a group of people who you don't know very well, finding a common ground helps you to ease that discomfort. Finding something that you all enjoy talking about @MONTH1 be hard to do, but finding something that makes you laugh is a lot easier. Laughter is something that everyone enjoys and can take part in even if they're not contributing to the conversation. By feeling as though you're a part of what's going on, you feel accepted, and that's all anyone ever wants."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
20964	8	" It was @DATE1 seventh and I had invited my two best friends, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, to go to my boyfriend's football game with me. It would be the first time for them to meet him since he went to a different high school than we did. Our plan was to get off the bus at my house and then my @CAPS3 would take us to his game later. When we arrived at the end of the lane we started walking up to my house. Then all of the sudden ""ahhhhhh, @CAPS1 my god!"" @PERSON2 and I were both screaming at the top of our lungs, ""@CAPS2 a... ahhhh!"". @PERSON2 and I had almost stepped on a dead snake that was laying in the lane. While this was going on @PERSON1 had no idea what the problem was or why we were screaming. We looked back at her and saw a completely puzzled look on her face which we found absolutely hilarious so we burst out laughing. She soon figured out that we had been startled by the snake and also started in ""you guys are so funny @CAPS2 just a dead snake"". We talked and laughed our way up to my house. @CAPS4 we had caught up a little and I had changed into my boyfriends #@NUM1 jersey, we went downstairs to eat. We sat down at the table with our bowls of chili and started eating. My @CAPS3 came over and put her bowl down then went back into the kitchen to get something. When she came back she had napkins and another bowl, I playfully ask her ""are you really hungry @CAPS3?"" she said ""no..uh why?"" That's when the girls and I started laughing hysterically again, ""@CAPS3 you have two bowls you are obviously very hungry"" I giggled. She turned a little red and then said back ""well I do love chili, I can't ever seem to get enough of it"" then she laughed a little ""your probably right I should just start with one bowl.""  @CAPS4 we gathered the blankets for the stands we left. On our way up we made a pit stop at the famous @ORGANIZATION1. I was so exited to see my boyfriend and to have my friends come along that coffee was probably not the best idea, but we stopped anyway. While we were in there waiting for our coffee we passed the time by making faces through the nearby window at people who happened to drive by. We were cracking up over the looks people gave us, some looked like @CAPS5 thought it was funny while others looked like @CAPS5 thought we had escaped from a nut house. Soon enough our drinks were ready and we headed out the door. Then as we were walking to the car some guy whistled at us. We hopped in the car and then lost it when we saw that it was some guy who was dressed up in one of those statue of liberty costumes.  We were almost at the school and I was bouncy from the caffeine and excitement mix. My @CAPS3 had never driven to @PERSON3's school before, while my dad had only was busy that night. I was trying to keep calm while giving her directions in a very giggly manner. I started off by saying ""you go straight up here @CAPS3"" the my @CAPS3 and the girls said ""honey you can't go straight up here"". ""yes you can"" I argued then @CAPS4 a while @PERSON1 said ""girl look you could go straight but you ain't gonna see @PERSON3 if you do"". I realized @CAPS5 were right and told my @CAPS3 ""don't turn, just turn right"" she got confused cause I had said the directions wrong so she turned left. I started to freak, screaming ""no no no! we have to turn around I meant right"" @CAPS5 all burst out laughing at me ""man calm down woman, we just have to turn around"" said @PERSON2. We finally got back on track and I tried to give clear directions. I wasn't completely positive where the turn off was for his school so I told my @CAPS3 to go slow, when we passed it and I freaked out again. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS3 we have to turn around"" @CAPS5 all laughed at this and then my @CAPS3 said that she was testing me to see if I could be patient. We all laughed again. When we got there and hopped out to pay and get in. We got there in in time to see the guys come out of the locker room. I got another dose of excitement, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 started to walk away so I could wave at @PERSON3. I pulled on their shirts and begged them to stay because I didn't want to be the only person waiting. Then I saw him run past and before I knew it I leaped off the ground and waved frantically. I saw him smiling as he ran onto the field, my friends laughed at how I jumped and we enjoyed the game."	16	20		36				3	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4

You were infinitely beautiful in my eyes. We had the most fun that human beings were capable of. Every time we were together there was no thought in my mind that we were not happy together, no worry that you would ever leave. I never wanted to imagine life without you. As a child i had always had the title of the kid who smiles all the time, @CAPS4 when i thought of you i got this glow. Everybody saw it. they would ask, ""@CAPS2 have you been doing? Your so happy, I've never seen you like this before."" That, @CAPS2 they saw in me was the power of love. @CAPS4 something they did not see was @CAPS2 we had together. When it was just me @CAPS3 you @CAPS3 one of us would do something @CAPS3 neither of us could stop the laughter. When our stomachs hurt from @CAPS1 so hard. that is @CAPS2 I love, I grew to love every part of you. Especially your laugh.  From @CAPS2 i hear, they say the laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I would have to agree. Being able to laugh with someone, @CAPS3 being able to be yourself @CAPS3 not have to hold up this front, its magical. Its something that makes a relationship last. I guess its kinda like glue in sense. My brother @CAPS3 i are the closest you can get to best friends, @CAPS3 guess @CAPS2 we do in our spare time? We laugh. Hes someone that i can be silly @CAPS3 dumb @CAPS3 goofy with @CAPS3 he still laughs, @CAPS3 he still loves me. :) @CAPS4, although he is my brother it still holds the same respect, @CAPS1 is great. It is also a stress reliever. My teacher told me so. My health teacher that is.  "	16	16		32				3	3	4	3	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	3

But with a friendship based on laughter, when do you trade in the giggles for seriousness? I believe laughter is vital in a friendship. But to have a strong, healthy, relationship you also need a level of seriousness. This is the story of how I learned to balance laughter and seriousness in one of my most important relationships.    Olivia has been my best friend as long as I could remember, hanging out we laughed constantly. Laughter has always been a huge part of our friendship and always will be. But going into middle school we faced drama, boys and arguments, which we never experienced with one another. All of these small but important things to us then added up and began to make us drift apart. Our lack of sharing our feelings and instead cover it up with laughs caused us to bottle up anger towards each other. I always thought we were perfect matches for best friends because our countless inside jokes and the constant fun we would have. But our anger grew until we were ready to handle it, which we did not understand then.   We started to hang out less and less, and our daily calls became weekly. Both of us noticed a change in our friendship, but didn't know how to fix it, we apologized for fighting with each other and sympathized for our boy troubles but it wasn't the same. I missed her but the longer it went on the easier it was to not talk or hang out. Summer came around and our moms planned me to stay a week at her house while my parents were on vacation. To put it nicely I was less than thrilled, how was I suppose to stay a week there when we barely talk anymore? I knew everything would be okay but I still worried that the week would be constant fighting instead of laughs.    Finally the day came and my parents were driving me to her house. As I got there things were fine, we pretended nothing was going on and had fun, it was that way for a few days. But on the third day she broke the ice, asking what was wrong and why we don't talk anymore. That day something amazing happened, we talked about all our feelings and what was upsetting us. It was a little awkward at first but we got through it together. The fights got less and less because we knew the things that bugged each other, and everything slowly became better than it was before. That talk changed our relationship forever and I'm so glad she had spoken up when I didn't or else we wouldn't be as close as we are today.    That day was @DATE1, but had a huge impact on our friendship.Ever since we got that mile stone in our friendship I knew better how to be more open with other people also. Olivia has taught me so much but this was among the more important lesson. Laughter is a huge part of any strong relationship but you also need to be able to share your feelings and be serious. Everyone needs a best friend to laugh with and I am grateful to have mine stick with me no matter what."	21	20		41				5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20975	8	" Laughter is a part of life. It can help bring people together or even tear them apart if it is in bad taste. There was a time when me and my cousin @PERSON1 did not really like each other but I had to stay at his house because my mom was out of town. After that night we were closer then brothers and there is one huge funny tale behind it. I was really reluctant to even go over there that night. But my mom told me to stop complaining and to just try to have fun. When I got there we pretty much just watched @LOCATION1 in awkward silence. Then his parents informed us that they were going out and that they would not be home until it was very late. About ten minutes after they left my cousin @PERSON1 turns to me and says ""you want to do something really fun."" @CAPS1 I was at the young age of thirteen years old a could not help but to be interested. So I asked him what this fun thing was and he told me it was a surprise. We left his house and cut through his field to the wall of blackberry bushes that surrounds his field and he showed me a little path through a certain spot. After we got through the bushes we ended up on a gravel road that led to a house that had a lot of land surrounding it. And on the land were what my cousin identified as fainting goats, I had no idea what fainting goats were. So my cousin said he should just show me what they are and what they do. @PERSON1 walked right up to these goats and made a sudden noise, about a quarter of them just fell over stiffened and unmoving. I was roaring with laughter at the fact that these goats fainted when they got scared. We spent about forty five minutes scaring them and watching them faint. No matter how many times we did it, we found it no less amusing then the first time. The funniest thing by far that happened that night, started off when @PERSON1 informed me that he brought an @NUM1 firework. We put it in the middle of where all the goats had flocked to and lit it. It went off and the bang that was as loud as a gunshot. As one entity the goats all collapsed and we were doubled up with laughter, that is until the people in the house came out side. We ran like our life's depended on it, we flew down the road through the blackberry path, trough the field and straight into @PERSON1's house. We sat down on the couch then we looked at each other, we burst out laughing, my ribs were aching from it, I was light headed with laughter. His parents got home about a minute after we calmed down which we also found extremely funny. As soon as they went to bed we burst into silent giggles. That was one of the funnest times I've had with my cousin and even tough we did not like each other before hand, we ended up becoming brothers in all but blood, but we were cousins so maybe even a little bit by blood but mostly brothers in laughter."	20	16		36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	3

When ever I got sick or hurt I will allways laugh at a great joke and it made me feel a little better when ever my family go on a long trip we always made jokes and tease each other soon the trip dont seem that long at all. it's very short and you wish that it could of been longer. One night me and my family was going home from the store and my brother asked ""what are we having for dinner tonight"" ""hambugers"" she told us my brother kind of freaked out becouse we dont got @ORGANIZATION1's and my mom said all well and my dad then was in a smal store called @CAPS1 hopped in the car and started to drive home. ""I feel like having mexican food tonight can we eat at @ORGANIZATION2's tonight"" my mom asked ""no I thought we were having hambugers tonight"" he answered ""We have no @ORGANIZATION1's"" my mom laughed. Then my dad stopped the car and turned around ""why"" we all asked ""we don't got @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS2 has some chips at least"" then we all started bursting out laughing. Once we got ot the place and found a place to sit we were all talking and my sister bursted out "" look dad I can move the straw from just looking at it"" and she stared at the straw in the cup and everyone whent silent. I knew that it wouldn't move so I tapped the straw so it can move ""ha look it moved"" she was laughing knowing that she did not move the straw. my mom was trying to hold the laugh becouse my dad for a second thought she could move the straw for just looking at it. ""I can't believe I fell for that"" we finished up are meal and went home laughing and joking all the way.   Laughter can bring people together family, friends, even enymeys sometimes I laugh so hard that I could not breath so well. laughter bring fun in life and knowing that some other people have the same intrests and you @MONTH1 gain a friend you never know just like my family and the @LOCATION1's trip everyone laughs. When it snowed one day I graved my cell phone and gathered the neighbors and my brother and sister and went to the park together we had this idea to have a snow ball fight mixed with capture the flag. We all picked our bases and the type of flag that we want and then started the game we had fun playing we were laughing so hard that it hurt and soon before I relized it I was geting to know my nieghbor better after that day we talked to each other more and understood each other more the next time we have a snow ball fight I hope she is on my team and we will win for sure."	16	15		31				4	3	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	3						
20981	8	" My cousin @PERSON1 and I are constantly sick with laughter, he is the funniest person I know. He is hilarious when he isn't trying to be. I believe that is why he is so @NUM1king funny. @PERSON1 is a hardcore alcoholic, he is always drunk or drinking. On the rare occasion that he is doing neither of those two options, he is the dullest, most depressed, angry unfunny man around. Give him a drink or two and watch him turn into funtime @CAPS1. @PERSON1 and I have great grand wonderous times when there is an alcoholic beverage in or near his hands. @CAPS5 is sort of an awe inspiring thing to see this transformation take place. He starts as this sad, depressed, sober caged sociopath lion at the zoo with so many of society's judgemental, sour souled, pittiful excuses for men and women pointing, laughing and sobbing over this poor lion. When one of these ""people"" throw a beer his way he'll catch @CAPS5 in his fierce, angry teeth and devour a @NUM2 oz tallboy of @CAPS2 in mere seconds-- can and all! He then stands up on his gigantic feline paws and let out an amazingly deep vibrato of a purr. His big, ferocious cat teeth then smile like a @LOCATION1 lion, as his sick, beastly, blood stained fur slowly morphs into the scaley, scarred skin of a man. As he is standing there with a goofy idiotic sh!t eating grin he shouts ""I @CAPS3 @CAPS1 @PERSON1!!"" @CAPS5 really is an amazing thing, I have seen @CAPS5 so many times and I absolutely @CAPS6 find a single word to desribe this marvelous reconstruction of a living creature. Then with drinks in hand we will continue to have a great night of unknown comical amusements.

One @ORGANIZATION1 we were out at @CAPS3 great grandpas house, and we just got done opening our presents, and in the middle of the floor was a @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 cousin @ORGANIZATION2 thought @CAPS3 dad was inside the @CAPS2.   At first we tried to convince @ORGANIZATION2 that @CAPS3 dad was out side talking to @CAPS3 uncle. @ORGANIZATION2 didn't believe us, even though @CAPS3 dad was outside talking. @ORGANIZATION2 circled the @CAPS2, and observed the @CAPS2 and was convinced @CAPS3 dad was in it.  Then @ORGANIZATION2 started poking the @CAPS2. We were laughing because it was so cute that @ORGANIZATION2 thought @CAPS3 dad was in the @CAPS2. He kept saying ""I know he is in there."" @ORGANIZATION2 opened the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 dad was not in there. @CAPS3 dad walked in to the house and asked why we were laughing. We told him the story and he started laughing too. Later on in the @TIME1 @ORGANIZATION2 was playing in the other room and wanted to show @CAPS3 dad the toy he was playing with. So @CAPS3 dad climbed in the @CAPS2 and we told @ORGANIZATION2 that @CAPS3 dad was outside. @ORGANIZATION2 went outside to look for him but @CAPS3 dad wasn't there.   When @ORGANIZATION2 came inside he looked in every room and could not find @CAPS3 dad. After a while @ORGANIZATION2 was standing by the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 dad jumped out and scared @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 screamed like a little girl and we all laughed really hard.   @ORGANIZATION2 was mad at first then he started laughing too. At the time @ORGANIZATION2 was only five so when @CAPS3 dad jumped out at him he got really scared. @ORGANIZATION2 thought it would be funny to scare @CAPS3 dad so @ORGANIZATION2 hid in the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 dad came inside and we told @CAPS3 dad to look for @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS3 dad called his name looked in every room and pretended like he couldn't find @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 started laughing because @CAPS3 dad acted like he was going to sit on @ORGANIZATION2 and it made him laugh super hard. When @ORGANIZATION2 got out of the @CAPS2 he was like ""how did you know I was in the @CAPS2?"" @CAPS3 dad said ""well you started laughing silly goose.""   out of all the @ORGANIZATION1's i have had that @ORGANIZATION1 was the best @ORGANIZATION1 ever.

20992	8	" So many people sing songs and write stories about sad depressing events, like it's the only thing life consists of. We seem to never stop and focus on the little things. If we could stop and appreciate those little things, everyone would realize just how much they really have. In some way or another we all seek pity and for some reason we want to have the worse story. Like it's some sort of competition. I personally don't want to have the worse story. If you just ""go with it"" things seem more lighthearted, care free, and people would rather be around someone that makes them feel good and happy than someone that makes them feel sad. There is many times where I could have chosen to stay mad and upset, but instead I chose to just laugh, and not make a big deal out of a small mistake. For example, @DATE1 was the @CAPS1 dance. I was supposed to be there early to finish decorating, but I was late (like always). It didn't really matter that I was late because when I got there I found out that it was canceled. By the time they decided to cancel it (due to a power outage) my parents already drove away and they didn't have their cell phones with them. I was stuck at the school. While I was trying to get hold of somebody to pick me up, two of my friends showed up, even though I told them that the dance was canceled. My friend's mom was nice enough to come pick us up. We met the rest of our friends downtown, where we decided to go to @LOCATION1's and play arcade games. We had an amazing time! We all got matching rings and I got two lollipops. When we were done we went up to our friends house, where we watched movies and ate popcorn. I had eaten way to much sugar and was super hyper! I kept saying a ton of random things, but it made for a great evening full of laughing. I could have been really upset that the dance was canceled, all of us could have, but we made the most out of what we had and ended up having a really good time. And I personally think it was more fun than the dance would have been. Another example is when I was a freshman. There was one day that seem particularly hard. I felt like nobody wanted to be my friend or hang out with me. I remember sitting in the hall by myself, feeling like nobody cared. A senior that year came up to me and started talking to me. I remember him telling me that it's harder frown than it is to smile. I realized that he was absolutely right. Even though smiling takes more muscles, frowning in the long run has a worse effect. If I could go back to that day I wouldn't be such a drama queen. I was making a big deal out of something that wasn't even true. I always say things that I latter regret, but if I just ""go with it"" it doesn't seem near as bad. If I could, I would write a dozen songs that have no sad or depressing meaning. Or a millions books based on the happiest things in life. If you fall down, it's better to laugh than to run away crying. What won't kill you will make you stronger. Lots of things make you stronger, like: breakups, heartaches, @CAPS2.E class, and of course laughing. Laughing also makes you live longer; so why wouldn't you laugh as much as you possible could?"	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20993	8	" Many have heard that laughing makes you live longer. I don't know if this is true but I can believe it. When I laugh I feel lighter, my stress load lightens, @PERSON1 I am able to see the world with different eyes. This change in myself is more evident sometimes than others, such as if before the miracle of laughter I was feeling overworked, worn out, or sad. It is my belief that having people to make you laugh is essential to living a fulfilling life, @PERSON1 I am grateful that my days are filled with great friends @PERSON1 funny memories.  One of the things that must be present in any relationship is humor; you must be able to make each other laugh. I have had multiple times with my two best friends, @PERSON1, when we simply couldn't stop laughing. I deeply cherish all the time we spend alone together because I know that I will leave feeling happy, with a smile on my face, with many good stories to tell. One of these occasions was @PERSON1's birthday party the @DATE1 before last.  @PERSON1 wanted a small party with just the people closest to her there, so @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I were the only ones invited. We live a tiny, cute town, however, there isn't much to do in the area of parties. Because of this, everyone ends up going to @CAPS1, just half an hour away. It was a blistering @DATE1 day @PERSON1 we wanted to show off our tans, so of course @PERSON1 started her party off with a float on the meandering @CAPS2 river. That's when the laughing began. Three twelve year old girls drifting down a river by themselves with a giant beach ball (early birthday present) that was promptly dubbed @CAPS3, what could be so funny? One of the things that makes our friendship so important to preserve is how we find humor in every situation when we are together. They thought it was hilarious that I have an irrational fear of seaweed (or river weed, or pond weed, or any type of water weed for that matter ) @PERSON1 that I would yelp or full out scream every time that some touched me. I thought it was fantastic that @PERSON1 just couldn't hold on to her sandals, @PERSON1 would end up making wild dives for them as they floated away. We both thought the way @PERSON1, the @CAPS4 that she is, was reluctant to get wet was preposterous. @PERSON1, naturally, we pushed her in numerous times. These are the things that make our relationship so special. We can be serious for each other when needed, @PERSON1 no one will disrespect my friends @PERSON1 get away with it, but when we are together, I can let my guard down @PERSON1 can be myself. My goofy, irrational, apparently hilarious self, @PERSON1 still have fun.  Our laughter can even change how a situation is going to progress. For example, after we were done on the river, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I went to @ORGANIZATION1 for an afternoon of music @PERSON1 food. We all got enormous ice cream cones, the best money can buy. My friends had already finished theirs, @PERSON1 were playing with @CAPS3 a few yards away. I was just about to take another heavenly lick of my waffle cone when the @CAPS3 the ball flies over @PERSON1 knocks all the ice cream right out of my cone! I was left with a completely intact cone, but all of the good stuff was on the ground. Needless to say, I was devastated. Who knows what would have happened if @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 hadn't started laughing. Maybe I would have teared up, or sulked for an hour or two. However, my face was just so comical, staring in disbelief at the empty cone, that they just couldn't help but laugh. They fell on the grass, in hysterics. Even through my disappointment I started cracking up as well, @PERSON1 then everything seemed okay. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people, or three in my case. My two best friends make me laugh like no other people I have ever met, @PERSON1 I suspect I will never meet anyone else that makes me feel as they do. This laughter we have makes us feel better. It helps us relax @PERSON1 let our guard down, so the times after we laugh together is often when we confide in each other the most. If one of us is feeling down, or is under the weather, laughter is the sure fire way to get them back on their feet @PERSON1 smiling. Even simply being with them makes me feel more exuberant, lets me abandon my troubles. This is why laughter is so important to the the three of us. Whenever we laugh, our relationship builds. It is the good times we have had that help us through the bad times, @PERSON1 I know that our good times wouldn't have been so good were it not for the way we can laugh together."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
20996	8	"When I was younger my sister and I would fight all the time. It would either be verbally or physically. Whatever we fought about we would drag on for hours. Not only would we get more upset as time went on, but my mom and family members got fed up. It didn't help that there was only @NUM1 months between us. It would make everything ten times more tense. My mom had a few tactics to try to get us to stop. One would be grounding us. But we shared a room so that would only make it worse. Another was giving us chores which took up both our time and was annoying , the last one was making us sit criss cross apple sauce, face eachother, and hold hands. We hated this one. But every time that we did it we would end up cracking up and forgetting what we were even fighting about. After we did this we would give eachother a hug and move on. The laughter brought us closer and always helped to fix things."	19	19		38				4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4						
21001	8	" In my opinion, I think that laughter is a very important part of life. What would the world be like without laughter and jokes? It would be a very boring and dull place. I can't even imagine what it would be like. The world needs to have laughter in it. People need to make jokes and they need to have laughter and comedy in their life. I myself have a lot of laughter in my life. One day in fifth grade my best friend and I were jogging around the track for gym class. We were running together and talking and telling jokes to each other to help pass the time because it was really boring. I told this one really awesome joke, I can't remember what it was, and he started laughing so hard. We were both laughing together to the point we were crying. He fell down on the track, and rolled off into the grass. I said ""@CAPS1 on we need to keep going or the gym teacher will get mad"". He said, ""I can't, I just peed my pants!."" That made me laugh even more. He got up and walked over to the gym teacher. The gym teacher told my friend to go to the nurse's office. After gym class was over I met him back up with him in the classroom and he told me he called his mom and she brought him a new pair of underwear and pants. I wonder what his mom must have thought. It was a funny day.  We have always talked about that day together from then on. I would always jokingly make fun of him for peeing his pants, but I told him a funny joke. Our whole relationship was based on making each other laugh and telling jokes. Just all around the two of us being stupid together was what we did. Jokes and laughter made our friendship so much better and gave me amazing memories that I might possibly have for the rest of my life. At the same time, if you have no jokes and laughter in your friendship, it can make your relationship very boring and lame. If you do not have any, or little laughter in your friendship, then you do not have fun with that person and it makes you not want to hang around them because it just feels boring.  I have this other friend named @CAPS2, I occasionally go over to his house and we hang out and play video games together. The weird thing is, we hardly even communicate with each other. We just do stuff and don't have any fun with it. There is no jokes or laughter or anything awesome like that. We just play his video games silently not saying a word to the other person. Its the most pathetic thing I have ever seen. It is the most boring friendship two people could have. It is really boring over there because we just do the same thing over and over. I don't really like going over there that much. I would rather be at a different friends house having fun, but I still go over there anyway and I am not sure why. Without jokes and laughter in a friendship, it just makes things boring and not fun. It is something you definitely need to have. Laughter is not just an important element in a friendship, it is also an important element to have in a dating relationship. If you are dating somebody, then you absolutely need to have laughter in your relationship. If you look around you always see couples making jokes together and laughing with each other all the time, having fun. It makes their relationship interesting and enjoyable. Think about it, who wants to date a boring person that doesn't like to laugh and make jokes? Nobody wants to. So in a dating relationship you especially need laughter and comedy more than in a friendship. You want to keep things going good so the other person likes you and thinks your funny. That is one of the key things that makes a couple close. So as you can see by my three examples, laughter really makes a big difference in relationships and just in life in general. If you have laughter in a friendship it can really impact the relationship in a very good way. It makes it an interesting and fun relationship. Laughter makes people happy and get along with each other. If you are feeling down, laughter can always bring you up and make you feel better. It is almost like a medicine. If you do not have laughter, it can really make things suck, and make the relationship boring. Nobody wants that. People do not want a boring, lifeless relationship with somebody. Laughter is something that bring people together in a good way. It brings all of my friends together and makes us better friends. We have a good time and really enjoy ourselves. Laughter is a great thing that everybody needs to have in their life. "	20	21		41				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	5	4	4	4						
21004	8	"Laughter can sometimes be something that everyone shares together, sometimes it's used only for few as it's aimed against one another. But hopefully most of the time it's something that we all can share. Laughter opens up a relationship to where people can feel more comfortable with one another. Someone could be a complete stranger to one another and then just by a simple joke, laughter could make them look like they've been friends for years. Now laughing isn't the only thing that helps people become acquainted with one another, they can share similar hobbies or likes and dislikes, but most of the time laughter is something that everyone needs in a relationship. I remember when I fisrt met my friend @PERSON1, he wasn't to outgoing, but through making jokes he seemed more comfortable in talking with others. Me and him would often talk about @CAPS1 our daily lifes where to much to handle, but instead of making jokes about it, we decided to laugh about @CAPS1 we were complaining when our lifes we easy compared to others. Some people have to work @NUM1 jobs to support a family and we're over here complaining about @CAPS1 we have to wake up and go to school, we laughed at @CAPS1 pathetic we sounded. A couple of days later we found ourselves thinking about what we wanted to do when we older and out of high school. @PERSON1 said he wants to be a taekwando instuctor and that he's already got a small job at one, I said ""@CAPS1 did you get the job?"", he replied ""I kicked a kid in the face pretty hard when my instuctor was watching"". We both laughed really hard, and just by that laugh we became even more of friends, cause it's through laughter that we can become civilized."	14	15		29				3	2	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21005	8	"     Laughter @CAPS1 is one the most important things in life. People shouldn't go a day without @CAPS1. It's healthy and good in any relationship. It can also help with healing. The best kind of laughter is when you're out of breath and crying. It makes people so happy and wanting more. Don't take life too seriously, just laugh and smile all the time.  Someone dying is a dreadful thing. When two high school boys die, it's even worse. On a @DATE1 @TIME1, a group of high school students were walking on the rocks by the ocean, when a sneaker wave snatched two of them. The other kids tried so hard to save them by making a rope of clothing to reach them, but it didn't work. Two beautiful lives were taken away that day, and will not be forgotten. The boys were well liked and had great lives. The families of the students, the school, friends and the community were in shock, and couldn't believe the terrible news. How could this happen to such amazing people.  Hundreds of students gathered at church the following @DATE2, most in tears. They talked about the two boys, and had a huge group prayer. Friends spoke well of them, missing them greatly, talking about the good, fun, memorable times. @CAPS1 can make it better. As someone once said, smile because they lived, don't cry because they're gone. At the school's basketball game, they honored the boys, and won the game for them. Parents and friends spoke about the beautiful kids in front of almost @NUM1 people, that came to support the school. The game was a time for having a good time and not to sob and mope. This game helped heal the community just a little more. @CAPS1 and cheering really can help the heart.  As days, weeks, and months go on, people will still be heartbroken. Although, as long as we laugh and smile about the good times of those who left, we can make it though anything. @CAPS1 makes you feel better. It just shows you that you have to make the best with what you have, and always have a fun time with no regrets. Always tell the people that mean something to you, that you love them. Never stop telling people you love them, and never leave in a fight. You don't know when it might be the last time you see them. @CAPS1 is so important, and without it life would not be as great as it is."	15	17		32				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	4	4	4	3						
21009	8	" Laughter is a natural reaction every human being has when they are either happy or have heard or seen something that is funny to them. It is healthy to be happy other than sad or mad. Laughter is pretty much a sign of happiness, as crying is of sadness. It is just another natural emotion any person is born with. I agree to the quote someone once said about laughter being the closest distance between two people because, if two people get along, they will have many moments in life together where they are happy. It is easy to get along with people who have a good sense of humor as for they won't take everything personally and can understand a joke. Its always good to have a sense of humor because its something everyone appreciates, also, that way people can see that you like to have fun when you know you don't have to be serious. When your with a group of friends that you get along with very well, one of the main things you will hear is laughter. It shows that you get along and that your having a good time.  Of course there are times when its better not to laugh, or when people laugh for no reason, which often gets annoying. Yes laughing means your happy, but when its not needed and is used just to cause noise, it is better to be quiet than annoy everyone around you. In my group of friends we are always laughing and joking around with each other, i like when people have a good sense of humor, i feel more relaxed and its easier to talk to them. Unless, that is, they take everything as a joke and never take anything seriously. Even though it is natural, you have to know when you can and cant laugh. Its a way to show happiness, but in certain situations, it can be disrespectful or rude.  Sometimes when I'm with my friends, they @MONTH1 joke around about a certain person, and once it happened like this;at my friends birthday party, we all went to a bowling alley and as always, were all standing around talking and having a good time. While we were talking, @PERSON3 and @PERSON4 were joking around about something so we all started listening to their conversation. They were joking around about something and then @PERSON3 said something as to turn him down in some way, ask a joke, and @PERSON4 said that hes going to get his heart broken. Right after that was said, @ORGANIZATION1 pitched in, adding again. So it turned out to sound like @PERSON4 was going to have his heart broken again. As everyone laughed at it, @PERSON4 looked at @ORGANIZATION1 with a hurt expression and was the only one not laughing. You see, @PERSON4 had a girlfriend that broke up with him about two months ago, @ORGANIZATION1 forgot about that and didn't mean anything when she added ""again"". She meant it as a joke but it turned out to sound very mean. In this case, the laughter caused by @ORGANIZATION1 was meant for @PERSON4, who was hurt by @ORGANIZATION1's comment. Good thing @ORGANIZATION1 noticed and remembered about @PERSON4's ex later that day. She ended up apologizing for saying something she should have thought through more carefully before saying.  How a person takes it when people laugh at them, has a lot to do with friendship. One time, my friends were driving to a party, or home from a party and were listening to music in the car, one of the guys in the car was singing his heard out to a song by @PERSON1. At one point, while he was singing, his best friend suddenly turned down the volume so everyone in the car heard @PERSON2 sing really loud, with no music. Everyone started laughing because @PERSON2 didn't know that @CAPS1 would turn off the music in the middle of something. Even though it was kind of embarrassing, @PERSON2 laughed along because it was pretty funny. If @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 weren't such good friends, i think for sure @PERSON2 would have gotten mad at @CAPS1 for doing such a thing to him while there where other people in the car aside from just them two. Friends understand each others sense of humor, and know when doing something is going to far, or when the other person will think it's funny too and will laugh along. So as you see, laughter can be happy, thankful, annoying, and or mean, you just have to know when it's okay to do, and when it is better not to laugh. Even though it's a natural reaction, it is one that can be controlled and thought about before doing. Next time someone says something that's funny, first think about if it can be insulting to someone before laughing at it and hurting someone. Otherwise, enjoy life and be happy."	17	16		33				4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	3						
21014	8	" One day i was with my friend @PERSON1. We had been friends for a really long time. I was in a bad mood that day because my dog, taco ran away and i had gotten into an arguement with my parents. @CAPS4 asked me if i wanted to go out on a walk, and i said i did. We were really good friends at this piont, and @CAPS4 always knew when something was wrong, even though i think i hide @CAPS1 pretty well. As we wakled, we walked past children playing at the park with thier parents, and a man playing fetch with his dog, @CAPS1 was sunny and warm. @CAPS1 was durring the summer-time. We stood on the bridge for a minute, then @CAPS4 asked me ""whats wrong, @CAPS2?"" @CAPS3 @CAPS1 odl him everything that happend, i told him that my dog had ran away and that my parents were mad at me. I told him that i was sad. I dont know why i opend up to him like that we hardly ever talk about our life drama. we're always laughing and making jokes. I thought @CAPS4 liked me, actually i was hoping @CAPS4 did. I liked him, i had for a while.  We started talking about everything that was going on in our lifes, school, friends, parents, and alot more. @CAPS4 put me in a better mood. We decided to go to the park and sit at the pic-nic tables. We sat across from eachother, and sat there talking for a while. Then @CAPS1 started getting late and i had to get home. I said ""thanks for cheerig me up, i really needed to laugh and smile today."" @CAPS4 looked at me, and took my hand in his and said ""@CAPS5 should always laugh, because @CAPS5 never know who is falling in love with your smile."" and then @CAPS4 kissed me. That is the a day i'll remember for a long time. I'm still with @PERSON1, we've been together for almost @NUM1 months now."	17	16		33				4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	3						
21016	8	" Laughter is such a great joy in my life. If people never laughed life would be dull and boring, most of my favorite experiences involve @CAPS9 while having a good time. One of my best experiences with laughter was going camping with my friends last @DATE2. I will never forget that experience last @DATE2.  During the middle of @DATE2 on a beautiful sunny @DATE1 @TIME1 my @CAPS4 @CAPS1 calls me and @CAPS2 me were getting a bunch of guys to go camping and I should come. Immediately I @CAPS3 my parents to let me go with the only exception of turning in my job application to @ORGANIZATION1 before I left for camping. After turning in my application I got in the car picked up my @CAPS4 @PERSON3 and makings for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and left for the adventure.  After I got to my destination after driving @NUM1 miles up river I didn't see anyone just two huge tents where my friends were supposed to be. Looking @CAPS5 the camp site had been attacked by bears with trash laying all around and camp fire still going i started searching for my friends. I found @CAPS1 passed out in one of the tents and tried to wake him but he was dead asleep. @PERSON3 and me not knowing what to do so we sat in the shade of the large trees surrounding us, it was a good @NUM2 degrees outside. After about five minuets we herd a splash and went to investigate. We walked towards the river and found all of out friends jumping off a @NUM3 ft rock into the river and we went to join the fun. After jumping off about @NUM4 times each we headed back to camp. @CAPS1 was awake and @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @CAPS7, @PERSON3 and myself all huddled around the camp fire @CAPS8 we returned to camp and told jokes all night.  All of us really bonded that three day camping trip @CAPS9 and joking and just being boys. I wouldn't get rid of those memory's for anything. After camping i returned to home and worked a lot of the rest of @DATE2 but ever since then have had really good friendships with all of my camping buddies."	16	15		31				2	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21030	8	" I moved to the @LOCATION4from @LOCATION5 with my family when I was just a child. We moved the small town of @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, where we have lived for @NUM1 years. Over the years there have been many difficult times, but we always managed to get through them by laughing together as a family.This past year has been especially trying, and I don't think we would have survived if we hadn't been able to celebrate the tragic time with laughter. My @CAPS2 stayed in @LOCATION5 when we moved to the @LOCATION1 because he was sick and didn't think he could survive the trip. Last year we finally convinced him to @CAPS3 up here with the rest of the family. He moved in with my family and shared my bedroom. It was hard because he snored and made strange noises in his sleep, but I was glad he was with us. When I would wake up tired from lack of sleep, I would just think about the funny noises and laugh.  Then, six months ago, my @CAPS2 was dianosed with a tumor in his brain. There was nothing the doctors could do for him, and they told us he only had a few weeks to live. We were devastated and I couldn't stop crying. We asked @CAPS2 what he wanted to do. He said, ""I want all of you to stop looking like I'm already dead and let's go have some fun!"" That was just like @CAPS2. He said we were going on a trip to @LOCATION2 so he could go to @LOCATION3 before he left this world. I couldn't help laughing at how crazy he could be. Sure enough, when I arrived home from school the next @DATE1, @CAPS2 told us we had ten minutes to grab what we needed and get in the van. He had gone out and rented a @NUM2 passenger van for the trip so everyone in the family could go. We just stared at him. He started laughing and told said, ""@CAPS3 it or you're staying behind!"" I started laughing too, and hurried inside to pack. It was the best trip of my life. @CAPS2 told us all kinds of crazy stories about when he was a boy. Mom wrote some of them down so we could always remember them.  When we got to @LOCATION3 we went on every ride in the park. @CAPS2's favorite was @ORGANIZATION1. He wasn't supposed to ride it because of his condition, but he just laughed and said, ""I""m sure it won't kill me."" @CAPS4 though it made me sad when he said it, I still laughed because he was so happy. Two months after we went home, @CAPS2 died. @CAPS4 though it has been hard and I have cried about it often, I can't help but laugh when I think about that trip and how much fun we had. @CAPS2 taught me that laughter can make all the difference in turning any situation around."	20	24		44				4	4	5	4	4	4	5	5	5	4	4	5						
21035	8	" My @CAPS1, my friend, and myself were driving down the road on our way to pick up a mutual friend for youth group that night. Our conversation was anything but special. We were mainly just telling stories of fun times that we had already had with our old friend, and looking forward to making some new ones together. She was such an amazing person. Always ready to crack a joke, make new friends, and have a good time. Her smile was cute, and she was bale to talk someone into doing anything.  As we pulled up to her house, we were thrilled to be able to see her again. It had been weeks since the last ""play date"", and we couldn't wait to be able to catch up with her. She walked out her front door and trotted to our car. The smile on her face was enough to tell us that the feeling, of being reunited, was mutual. Getting out of the car we received bear hugs from her. Times of fun we had had together were flashing in my minds eye, and I was hoping that there would be many more that I would be able to look back on one day. We all got in the car, pulled out of her neighborhood, and started down the road. I realized that we were going the wrong way. ""@CAPS1, we have to go back the other way, don't we?"" I asked. ""@CAPS2, but the barrier in the middle of the road won't let me make a @CAPS3 turn until up the street a little ways.""she said. ""@CAPS4, is that even legal?"" I asked, knowing the answer would be no. ""@CAPS5, I don't really have a choice now do I @CAPS6?"" I could hear the sarcasm in her voice. She could make her voice and appearance sound and look mean, but I knew that in reality, she was just messing around with me. The barrier dissipated, and she was getting ready to make the @CAPS3 turn. Cranking the wheel she was barely able to clear the end of the barrier, but was to late to be able to stop in time to clear the curb on the other side. She accidentally backed up onto the curb making those of us in the back seat jump, and sway, from the impact. My friends and I were all laughing, knowing that she was usually very careful, and had good driving skills. ""@CAPS8 everybody,"" she said. Her body language showing that she was having fun, but that she truly was @CAPS8 for giving us a jolt like that. Our reply was pure laughter. ""@CAPS5, I guess that's our fun for the month,"" she said, her eyes sparkling with joy about making us laugh. She was always very quick to make jokes about situations we were put in.  She pulled forward, the back fender scraping the curb again as we drove off it. Driving away, my friends and I were still laughing , replaying what had just happened to us in our minds eye. It was one of our fondest memories together. A continual joke that we can just mention, and burst into laughter because of it. ""@CAPS10 for the ride @PERSON1,"" my friends said as we got out of the car. We walked into youth group, laughing, knowing that this would be one of the many memories that we would cherish forever. Bringing us closer than ever before."	25	20		45				5	5	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21049	8	"                                 @CAPS2 @CAPS1      The first time i ever heard about the sport @CAPS2 @CAPS1 was the beginning of my freshman year. I was interested in doing it but i wasn't really sure about it. Though during eighth grade i had played volleyball just for the fun of it and really enjoyed it. I had decided i wanted to play volleyball once i got into high school. But when i got into high school my opinion of still playing on the high school volleyball team changed. I realized it was much more then i expected, the people, and the attitudes i realized that if i were to play on the high school volleyball team i wouldn't have any fun. So i started to look into joining the @CAPS2 @CAPS1 team. I had finally decided to sign up and join the team. I had really hope i would like @CAPS2 @CAPS1 because it was my first year on the team and i had absolutely no idea what to expect of it.          The first day of practice, after school i went into the girls locker room, changed and took everything with me and went out to the track shed. When i got out there, i saw a lot of people i had never seen before, except for the kids in my grade and also my best friend. My coach @PERSON1 started to talk to everyone that was new to @CAPS2 @CAPS1. She told us that it would be a great experience and it was a a great sport and also it was more of a individual sport rather than a team sport. But also we did many things as a team. After she had talked and discussed the basics of @CAPS2 @CAPS1. We we're to jog our warm up lap and then stretch as a team. Then we were to start our run for the day and everyday was a different work out either a road run or a track work out. I began to really enjoy @CAPS2 @CAPS1. At first, i was beyond sore and couldn't move at all. But as the season started to really get going i eventually got into shape and looked forward to practice after school every day. We trained and got ready for my first race which made me very nervous i had no idea what to expect my first race ever and i was so scared and nervous. But after, i had ran my first race ever i felt good and was proud of myself. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is something i have always loved every since my freshman year when i first started to run.      One of my most favorite races we've ever done was called ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6"" the first time i ever ran in that race was my freshman year, it was like of our third or fourth races of the season. It also happen to be the first time we had done that race in over a couple years. So i was excited for it because i had heard about it and everyone was telling me how exciting it was going to be and that i would love it, the day of the race i was once again nervous like every other race I've been too and still am every since i first joined @CAPS2 @CAPS1. When we arrived at the destination we set up a tent, started to warm up for the each of the races that was going to happen a boys race and a girls race. We also went over the course and that's when i realized what everyone was telling me the mud pits and a huge steep hill and we had to @CAPS2 a river twice. After the race, i had such a great time my team and i laughed and we all enjoyed ourselves. It was so much fun, our bus rides as a team, all the fun practices. As a team we enjoyed many laughs and all the fun times we've had together. My favorite year of @CAPS2 @CAPS1 would have to be my freshman year because it was my best season, i loved it. We grew to love each other and bonded as a team. Laughter was a big part of @CAPS2 @CAPS1 we laughed and enjoyed each others company as we practices and also as we were on bus rides on the way to our meets. We had a lot of fun, and laughed often as a team and that to me was a big part of getting to know my team and being able to bond and build relationships and friendships with everybody on my team. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is a sport where laughter is a big part of running and having fun and enjoying everyone's company, without laughter our team would not be as happy,excited, or even ready to practice. Laughter is big in @CAPS2 @CAPS1 without it our team would not have as much fun as we've had over the years.    "	18	20	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
21055	8	" Laughter is a huge part oh building friendships, relationships, and partnerships. Laughing is the first thing you learn to do you are born knowing how to laugh its the only thing that you are born to know how to do. Laughter for me is what starts a friendship if I can make someone laugh we are already closer then when we first said ""@CAPS1"". As an example when I started working at the daycare i am at now when I got the other teachers to laugh you can just tell its there way of excepting you as part of there crew.  On the first day of work I walked in the the daycare nervous they sent me to the preschool classroom. I am pretty sure my boss could tell I was nervous and it made me laugh. It made me feel welcome to be there and like we could be friends. The children in that class room made me laugh the things they did. well working with children you find out if you can make them laugh or if you laugh at there jokes they are more inclined to trust you and with that you can make them feel comfortable around you. Having someones trust is sometimes hard to get but if you get it from the very beginning its easy to keep but also very easy to lose. When someone is down in the dumps making them simply laugh can make everything better laughter is like medicine in makes you feel better when nothing else can. Its safe to say making people laugh comes natural to I am just good at it and jokes come easily. When you laugh it makes everything better. Laughing is actually health and is a form of excursive.  When I am at work and kids laugh it makes me feel better even if I am having the worst day ever. When I am around people that are happy it makes me feel alot better about myself. Its even better when its babies that laugh becasuse they are so cute when they do it."	15	20		35				3	3	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21056	8	"Laughter, @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 on an @CAPS3 @DATE1 @CAPS4  One of my favorite @DATE1 traditions is the visit to the house of our @CAPS2, the @CAPS5. They live on eighty forested and meadowed acres outside of a quaint, old town. Their small green house overlooks brown fields and a blue pond, with tall trees forming a backdrop.  We arrive midmorning. We either find our @CAPS2 in the house or encounter them tromping out of the woods to meet us, shovels, chainsaws and other trailbuilding implements in their hands. After the customary hello, how have you been, we often wander around the yard, exclaiming at the new fruit trees or hearing stories about the latest tenants of the birdhouses.  During the hottest part of the @CAPS4, we head for the shade of the lush @ORGANIZATION1 woods. A short walk will bring us to a trail. I love walking among the sun-streaked ferns and fallen logs, treading carefully the rickety bridges over burbling streams, bouncing confidently on the sturdy new bridges, and trying to avoid the dogs as they galumph in and out of the water. @PERSON2 knows all about the flora and fauna of the region, so we get a constant stream of knowledge as we hike. He also, of course, has to tell us about the trees he's planted -- a redwood here (look how well it's doing! A foot since last fall!) and a douglas fir over there (not as well. That big redwood is shading it too much). One of the best parts of the hike is when we see the dead-end section of trail that my family helped construct three years ago. We always walk to the end of it and discuss where it could go from there -- over the stream or beside it, or up the hill and if so, where would the switchbacks be? could you really bike up a trail like that?  After our walk, we arrive back at the house, sweaty and talkative. Then it's time to put on swimsuits and jump in the pond! They recently built a dock that we can jump off of -- a great improvement over wading in from the edge. We swim for the majority of the @TIME1, racing from one end of the pond to the other, splashing on innertubes, having pondweed-throwing battles. Finally we get tired and sit by the side of the pond, drying off in the warm sun.  By @TIME1, dinner is ready. Laura usually makes salmon, accompanied by a plethora of delicious side dishes. We drag chairs out to the hill above the pond and enjoy a leisurely supper. From the hill, we can see turtles and birds on the pond, bugs over the fields, and more birds swooping through the air feasting on the aforementioned bugs. After the meal, we haul chairs and dishes back to the house and sit on the porch into the @TIME2.  @PERSON2's favorite part of the @CAPS4 is at dusk, when the sun is at just the right angle to show all the bugs swirling through the air. At one point, all the bugs gather together and create a tornado, twisting upwards into the darkening sky, and then -- they're gone, until the next @CAPS4. It's an incredible spectacle; thousands of tiny insects disappering at one swoop.  The best thing about these days is the friendship and comradery we have with this wonderful family. The parents knew each other long before us kids were born, so we have a lot to talk about; @PERSON2 is very interested in science topics, and he always finds a way to bring up the latest article he read. And, as with all great @CAPS2, we laugh constantly. I consistently get hiccups at least three times just when we're lounging on the porch after our busy @CAPS4. Even on the most serious topics, my dad or the @PERSON1 boys can find a joke to make, usually ""politically incorrect"" but always very funny.  Now don't even get me started on the @DATE1 camping trips, winter ski trips or autumn cider pressing we do with the @CAPS5. "	24	24		48				5	4	5	5	5	5	5	4	5	5	5	5

I observed the way @CAPS7 glared at @CAPS27 in the room, and how her facial expression never changed. ""@CAPS2 huh,"" my cousin, @PERSON1, asked while staring at @CAPS3, who was, of course, the new girl. I glanced over at @CAPS3 and then back at @LOCATION1. ""@CAPS5 on! @CAPS11 can say @CAPS26! @CAPS7 can't hear us,"" @CAPS7 whispered. @PERSON1's whispers weren't exactly as quiet as @CAPS7 thought. @CAPS3 could probably hear everything we were saying. I glanced over at her again, and I noticed behind those cold eyes, @CAPS7 seemed kinda lonely and sad. I guess @CAPS26's possible, @CAPS7 has been the talk of the whole @NUM1 grade class since @CAPS7 arrived about @NUM2 days ago. ""@CAPS6 hello! Taylor? Are @CAPS11 there?"" @CAPS7 was now in my face and view of @CAPS3.  ""@CAPS7 does look @CAPS2 on the outside, but maybe @CAPS7 is actually a nice person,"" is @CAPS1 I said, but I knew @CAPS15 would not satisfy @PERSON1 at all. ""@CAPS1? Definitely not. Her parents probably belong to some mafia or something. @CAPS7 gives off that type of aura."" ""@CAPS11 shouldn't judge someone @CAPS31 their looks,"" I responded. @PERSON1 gave me @CAPS15 sort of confusing look. ""I mean, @CAPS11 never know unless @CAPS11 ask.""  ""@CAPS12 if your such the expert on @CAPS26 why don't @CAPS11 go sit with her at lunch, and ask her."" @CAPS13 man. There was @CAPS29 way I could possibly do that. I know I @CAPS24 said not to judge someone @CAPS31 their appearance, but @CAPS7 looks like if I even open my mouth to speak to her @CAPS7 will kick me in the shins. @CAPS1 a predicament @CAPS15 is. ""@CAPS14't @CAPS11 the one who wants to get to know her? @CAPS11 ask."" @CAPS15 one won't @CAPS31 past @PERSON1 either. ""@CAPS16? @CAPS29 way. We already decided @CAPS11 were going to ask. @CAPS11 can't @CAPS5 back with the same thing,"" @CAPS7 argued. @PERSON1 is a very stubborn girl, and though @CAPS7 likes to pick on me, @CAPS7 really is a nice person. Also, despite her obnoxious exterior @CAPS7 has a lot of friends, unlike myself who is shy.  ""@CAPS17,"" I muttered. I had to give in. @CAPS29 matter @CAPS1 I say, I am going to have to face @CAPS3.  ""That's @CAPS1 I thought. @CAPS26's a good opportunity to make a new friend. I am @CAPS24 helping @CAPS11 out."" @CAPS7 had @CAPS15 mischievous grin on her face. I glanced over at @CAPS3 one last time, and then at the clock. @CAPS26 was @NUM3 in the morning, give or take a minute or two since I am nearsighted, but lunch is at @NUM4.  I couldn't pay attention at all during class. I was too busy playing out possible scenes that might occur at lunch. Maybe @CAPS7 isn't mean, maybe @CAPS7 is actually nice, and people are @CAPS24 misunderstanding, including me. That aside, I don't even know @CAPS1 to say; I can't @CAPS24 casually walk up, sit down in front her, look her in the eye, smile and say ""@CAPS21. How are @CAPS11?"" The impossible is @CAPS24 impossible and people should @CAPS24 except @CAPS26, in fact @CAPS26 should actually be a fundamental law. I looked over at the clock again, @CAPS26 was now @NUM5 and still ticking. ""@NUM6 minutes,"" @PERSON1 said in some type of singing tone. I sighed. ""@CAPS22? I kept watching @CAPS11 during class. Looked like @CAPS11 were going to jump through that window and run away at any second."" @CAPS7 laughed. My seat was @CAPS31 the window, and that option had not slipped my mind. ""I have @CAPS29 clue @CAPS1 I am going to say,"" I finally said.  ""@CAPS24 say anything that won't offend her. Ask about her hobbies or @CAPS1 @CAPS7 likes. Talk about school even,"" @CAPS7 replied. ""@CAPS26's time. Go."" @CAPS27 piled out of the class room and in to the cafeteria. After I got my lunch, I started walking toward the table @CAPS3 was at; @CAPS29 one was around her, @CAPS29 surprise there.  ""@CAPS6, @MONTH1 I sit here,"" I asked. My voice was kinda shaky and I thought I was about to have a heart attack from nervousness and from surprise at @CAPS1 @CAPS7 said. ""@CAPS31 all means, go ahead,"" @CAPS7 smiled. Wow, @CAPS7 is really cute when @CAPS7 smiles. I smiled back and sat down. I created a conversation @CAPS31 introducing myself and asking how @CAPS7 was and how @CAPS7 liked @CAPS15 school. To my surprise we actually shared a common interest, and bonded. @CAPS7 was laughing. I was laughing. We were laughing together.  After that day, and even still today we are the best of friends. That slight feeling of laughter is @CAPS24 so nostalgic, @CAPS26's almost indescribable. @CAPS24 something so minor such as laughter, or even a little giggle, can bring anybody together to form a simple bond, friendship. Laughter is truly an essential part of life."	20	20		40				4	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21060	8	" The human brain is a piece of work. Its the kingdom to our lives. It infuriates us, guides us, helps us and destroys us. Our brains can make our bodies feel anything it wants to. Its really something else. One of the most valuable things are brains are capable of is a sense of humor. Laughter. The ability to not take life to seriously for a moment. That light switch in @CAPS7 body that causes @CAPS7 brain to reach a state of uncontrollable happiness. Laughter is our brains only way of coping with the world. Scoping out the comical events life has to offer us. I am personally one of those people that finds everything in life funny, or will find a way to make it funny. I am hardly ever serious nor take things seriously. The same with my friends, we are always the people having a good time because we make life interesting. Maybe its our gnarly facial expressions we exchange one another, or we @MONTH1 just be funny looking. Either way we have a sense of humor. That's @CAPS4 life is about, @CAPS1 @CAPS7 happiness with people who fill @CAPS7 life with joy. @PERSON1 said, ""live simply, so that others can simply live."" I @CAPS9 we all can with a little sense of humor. Last year a couple friends and I went to mission ridge for a weekend to go snowboarding. We had it made, our own hotel suite with two king sized beds and a plasma @CAPS2. @PERSON2 and I slept on one bed and @PERSON3 on the other. We all have always gotten along perfectly and have shared the biggest laughs together. Nothing could come between any of us. Other than a little midnight prank. On the second night at the hotel, @PERSON3 fell asleep first. @PERSON2 and I were watching some ghost movie that bored us to tears. @PERSON2 was eating a bag of pop corn and started throwing little kettle pieces at @LOCATION1, trying to wake him up. ""@CAPS3, I have the funniest idea."" @PERSON2 whispered over to me. ""@CAPS4?"" I mouthed back lazily. Without a word @PERSON2 jumped out of bed and ran into the bathroom. She returned with a tube of @ORGANIZATION2 tooth paste, a sack of coins and a package of peach rings. ""I had nothing to do with this."" I stated, continuing to glare at the television set. @PERSON2 began squirting out tooth paste onto @PERSON3's arms, she ran the creamy solution down his legs, back up to his face and into his hair. She stuck quarters, dimes, and penny's into the minty cement, along with the sugary peach rings. ""@CAPS5 is going to kill you."" I gasped. ""@CAPS6 @CAPS5 wont! It will be hilarious."" @PERSON2 blurted and then plopped back onto the hotel bed, admiring her work. @PERSON2 then picked up her bag of popcorn and resumed throwing pieces of kettle at @LOCATION1's face. The next morning was not how @PERSON2 planned. @PERSON3 woke up alright, but did not have the expression on his face @PERSON2 intended on. ""@CAPS7 done for @PERSON2!"" @PERSON3 hollered. @PERSON2 smiled, still convinced this was all a joke. I saw the fury in @LOCATION1's eyes. @CAPS5 was beyond irate. His body crusted over with dried tooth paste. Quarters, dimes and penny's drilled into his skin and peach rings dangled moldy off his legs. @PERSON3 rushed into the bathroom to look into the mirror. @CAPS5 stormed back into the room with a shampoo bottle clenched in his hand. @PERSON2 turned to face him and her smile disintegrated. ""@CAPS4 are you gonna do with that shampoo bottle?"" @PERSON2 questioned, confused. @PERSON3 grew closer to @PERSON2, she backed away slowly, not quite sure @CAPS4 his intentions were. They both switched positions, her back now facing the door and @PERSON3 across the room by the window. @PERSON3 raised the shampoo bottle over his head. ""@CAPS9 fast."" @PERSON3 shouted and chucked the bottle as hard as @CAPS5 could at @ORGANIZATION1's face. But sadly, @PERSON2 ducked just in time for the bottle to miss her face and create a nuclear explosion on the door behind her. Blue liquid spewed out all over the walls. There was an indent of where the bottle hit the door. @PERSON2's whole back side was covered in blue sludge. I hopped out of bed and ran to the entrance where the explosion took place. @PERSON3 reached @PERSON2 and immediately burst into roaring laughter. @PERSON2 sat down in a puddle of shampoo and ruptured in chuckles. I stood there, smiling at them. @PERSON3 still crusted over, @PERSON2 covered in blue goop that looked like someone threw up a blueberry smoothie on her back. I sat down with them, we all starred at each other without a word. everything was fine. It then occurred to me that @CAPS6 matter @CAPS4 we do to each other, enrage or try to explode one another, we will always find a way to laugh about it. A sense of humor is merely our souls telling us everything will be okay. Its that one value in life we can cherish forever."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
21074	8	" Somewhere along the road a guy once said ""a laugh a day keeps the doctor away."" @CAPS1 the hell was he talking about? I didn't really know or understand the importance of it either. Until i found out first hand how important those words could be, and how right that unknown genius was. It was just a few years ago when the most traumatic event happened to me.Do you remember that first girl or guy you thought you loved? If you can, do u recall that feeling of heartbreak and utter distraught? Well, if u can then u might understand how I felt...and sometimes do feel. If not you @MONTH1 learn something of importance to which you might realize why you're single. Before that certain event,when @CAPS2 and I would end up fighting, we'd end up making jokes about it to get through. We'd sometimes intentionally go to see romantic movies to laugh at how the girl or guy in them would break down crying. In one of those sobbing weeping, just obnoxious sounding cries. The kind that pisses you off more than making you feel sympathetic. Back to the later and key point of all of this, when the horrible situation occurred @CAPS2 and i were together for years, two and a half to be specific. yeah, long time I know. The day it ended it happened to be in the middle of math class (can you believe that? the middle of freaking class!) @CAPS4 convinced me to go sit back in the corner of the room with her. It'd be just us, no interruptions. We did this everyday so it wasn't anything to unusual to me. I was thinking ""yeah! i get to work alone with my amazing girlfriend!"" I was such a idiot. I do fondly remember glancing her over before sitting down. @CAPS4 was wearing white bleached jeans and a black band t-shirt. @CAPS4 had skin so white and unblemished a porcelain doll would be jealous. To top it all off dirty blond hair, rose petal lips and believe me on this one unending curves. I was dressed similar. I was in my @PERSON1 t-shirt, black jeans and my signature burgundy beanie. I had natural tan glowing skin and dark brown curly hair that covered my dark green eyes. When I sat down I'm not exactly sure @CAPS1 it was, but I felt like something bad was going to happen. Almost like a oncoming thunder storm or that paranoid feeling of being watched. The most dreadful words fell out of her mouth like water coming out of a faucet. ""We have to break up"" my heart seized in my chest her other words blurred into one becoming inaudible. I remained not moving and completely silent like a stone gargoyle. I couldn't help, but laugh at myself silently inside my head. I didn't ever say anything back. I didn't trust my voice enough to be steady and unwavering. Even if my words didn't...my body did. I couldn't control the shaking of my body as if it was having one big muscle spasm. I quietly and quickly walked out of the room making sure to have my bag in hand. I didn't want a reason to have to come back. The hallways along with the tiles and eventually grass along with the pouring rain all blurred into one. I just kept on walking and walking, with no wear in mind. Until when i was finally to tired to stop. My cheeks were tear streaked to my jawline and my eyes were red and bloodshot. The most wonderful thing in the world to me in my life had ended. As i look back at @CAPS2 and I's relationship, laughter was how we survived and got through a lot. It was however not enough. No amount of trying to laugh it off would help, like those petty arguments we had. I will sometimes though look back on how I reacted and that by itself will make me laugh. I was no better than those people in those movies. Unlike them however, I did not weep and bawl obnoxiously."	20	17		37				4	4	5	5	4	4	3	4	5	4	4	3						
21077	8	"How Laughter @CAPS1 Laughter can be a huge help when going through difficult times. Like the time when my brother got ran over by a skid steer(tracked loader) at our farm. We didn't know how bad it was going to be @CAPS2 through our time of uncertainty our family was there to be with us and help us through and keep us from getting down. It was just another day on the farm and we were out running the machines. The day was going just fine until after dinner my mom had told me and my brother to go out and cut corn. ""@CAPS2 mom"" me and my brother said in unison. She wouldn't hear it and told us to hurry up and leave. So we went down to the shop and got the skid steer out. My brother, @PERSON1 still hadn't come down and so I started it and started driving towards the garden. I saw my brother coming from the corner of my eye. He was running as fast as he could and I yelled at him to stop and wait @CAPS2 he kept coming. He tried to jump on the front forks @CAPS2 missed and fell. I got out of the cab and saw him lying on the ground crying. My uncle was standing near by when it happened and he called the ambulance. We didn't know what was wrong with him @CAPS2 his leg looked a little funny so we looked closer and saw the bone sticking out of his leg. Finally when the ambulance came they looked him over and asked me some questions about what had happened. I told them all that i could and went back to the house. It was nerve racking to not know what was going to happen to his leg @CAPS2 we just hoped that it wouldn't be very serious. I spent the night at my grandparents house. I had a lot of trouble falling a sleep that night though. The next morning was @DATE1 so I had to go to school. I still didn't know a lot @CAPS2 i did know my brother's leg broke in a compound fracture. The whole school day my friends were helping me feel better by telling jokes and funny stuff and just keeping my mind off the accident. It was hard not knowing what was going on with him. Later that night we went to see him. We learned that he had just broken the big bone in his leg and that it had gone back together just fine. My mom stayed with him the whole time he was in the hospital so things around the house was a little bit different. Me, my dad, and sisters had to clean and take care of the house. It was a pain because I hate doing house work and having to do it all the time was vary boring. When my mom and brother finally got back after about a week things went somewhat back to normal.  My brother had to ware a thing on his leg that sucked the fluids out of the wound to help it heal faster. There was giant screws coming out of his leg that attached to a bar on the outside of his leg. He has healed up just fine though and has a giant scar where the bone came through his leg. It was very nice to have family and friends there to cheer us up and help us get through. And that is why laughter @CAPS1. "	20	18	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4
21083	8	" The members of my immediate family are known to be both incredibly clumsy and easily startled. Broken dishes are a common occurrence in our house; as are spilled drinks, stubbed toes, and blood-chilling screams whenever the toaster pops up. Though all of us are used to these types of things, not everyone around us is, which can lead to interesting encounters. Many people find pleasure in jabbing me in the sides to hear me scream, and laugh when I trip over the slightest crack in the floor. Though it can get annoying sometimes, it @MONTH1 also give me a reason to get over my pride and laugh at myself, thus relieving any tensions I @MONTH1 have been feeling about the social setting. For example, a few years ago I was staying with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 troop at @LOCATION1. Any situation involving large groups of people can be intimidating, but it is increasingly terrifying when the group is made up of girls, ages four to eighteen, with only a few adults thrown in to make sure the girls do not bludgeon each other to death. Worse still was that where I was staying, which was a hybrid somewhere between a cabin and a tent, the majority of the girls were in middle school and, needless to say, we did not always get along. Despite the fact that we were not all the best of friends, though, there were times when we were able to get past the petty differences, such as who was cool and who was not, and enjoy the time we had to talk and joke around with people who were in similar places in life. On one such occasion, I was attempting to make my bed on one of the top bunks, and was in the process of stretching my sheet over the petrified mattress which @MONTH1 have possibly been around in @NUM1 @CAPS3.C. Being the intelligent person that I am, I decided to lean against the wall behind me for balance, forgetting, of course, that there was in fact no wall, but only a thin, cloth-like material which could not support my weight. The second I realized what I had done, I reached about frantically for something to hold on to and tried in vain to keep myself from plummeting backwards to the floor and my certain death. Milliseconds before I would smash into the hard wood floor, I managed to grab a hold of one of the bars on the side of the bed and hung on for dear life, swinging back and forth and back and forth. Finally, I let go and propelled myself, almost gracefully, onto the bed sitting underneath mine. It was a very long time before the laughter died down. In that short amount of time, cliques and biases and grudges were all forgotten as we became not just a bunch of random girls placed in a room together, but a group with our own strengths and weaknesses; passions and flaws. Though the adolescent years are incredibly difficult and there are many times when it feels like you are the loneliest person in the world, it is always comforting to know that there are other people who laugh and cry just like you and experience many of the same joys and embarrassments as you do. One of the most essential skills to learn is that you have to be able to laugh at yourself from time to time and let yourself be vulnerable in front of other people. We @MONTH1 not all be the same, but we all have the same basic desires for love, acceptance, and laughter."	20	21		41				4	4	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	4						
21086	8	"               The @CAPS1 @CAPS2  @CAPS3 started out a few years back when I first met my cousin @ORGANIZATION1. For the first time I spent the night at his house, the day before we were outside all day running around his yard and jumping off their roof. @CAPS3 was all very fun and entertaining but no matter what we did @ORGANIZATION1 had something to say about every little thing we did or saw. ""this looks like that!"", or ""she sounds like this!"" @CAPS4 his tone of voice and his unique way of shouting @CAPS3, I could not stop laughing. @CAPS3 was unbearable, @CAPS3 made me laugh so hard and for so long that my stomach would begin to hurt and @ORGANIZATION1 himself would begin laughing from watching me slowly collapse from the uncontrollable laughter.@CAPS3 did not stop there, later that evening we stayed up almost the entire night watching @CAPS1 videos on @CAPS6 and playing @CAPS7 on the @NUM1. The laughter got even greater as we were both becoming extremely tired and our minds were racing all over our thoughts, we laughed until the point where I fell over laughing and holding my stomach. Every word that came out of my cousins imparable mouth made me burst out laughing as if I was hearing the funniest joke for the first time ever.The next morning I had an immense muscle pain in my chest, a sign of a fun and humorous night. even then, @ORGANIZATION1 still had a way to turn my stomach pain into a @CAPS1 subject. The next morning we had breakfast and @CAPS3 was just as fun as the night before. Listening to the nonstop comments and jokes on every thought and every subject and every thought possible. The day continued @CAPS4 the ever-lasting laughter between my cousin and I. Later as I left I though to my self how much more fun I'll have the next time I come to visit. From then on @ORGANIZATION1 and I became best of friends and the times got better and funner. Without laughter, life would be incomplete."	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21089	8	" After a long day at the @ORGANIZATION1 mom said it was my turn to decide where we went to dinner that night. I chose @CAPS1 @CAPS2 because I love their seafood. We got @CAPS6 legs, popcorn shrimp, and coconut battered shrimp. After the food we got two slices of double chocolate lava cake. For some reason it sent us into a fit of laughter. We laughed so hard, we started to cry. We had just finished going clothes shopping at the @ORGANIZATION1 and mom said that I could pick where we went out to eat. My brother started whining about it but mom said it was fair because he got to choose last time. I chose @CAPS1 @CAPS2 which is what my brother said he would have picked anyway. I picked that restaurant for two reasons, first because it was close to the @ORGANIZATION1, and second because I love seafood. Mom didn't have a lot of money so she said we should all share a few things instead for everybody getting their own. We bought two pounds @CAPS5 @CAPS6 legs, and order of popcorn shrimp, and coconut battered shrimp (mainly for herself). I'm kind of glad we all shared because it was cheaper and it was just the right amount of food so we didn't have to take home boxes. We never eat leftovers anyway. After our dinner my brother and I begged our mother to buy a dessert. after much thought and convincing she said alright and ordered two slices of the best cake I've ever tasted in my entire life!It was so rich my mom and I could barley finish our slice. My brother gulped his down with ease. After we were done the waiter came by and replaced our plates with the tab.  We all glanced at it and decided not to get dessert again(which never actually happened). Then mom got a bad case of the giggles. Shortly after my brother and i caught the giggles like a disease. Giggles turned into laughter and the laughter became hysterical. We couldn't seem to figure out what was so funny or how it happened. People were starting to stare at us but we still couldn't contain ourselves. Pretty soon our eyes started to water and then there were tears. Tears of joy I'd assume but I new one thing for sure, we had to get out of there. Mom managed to pay the tab just fine, but as soon as she got in the car and herd me and my brother laughing, she started busting up again! She was absolutely convinced it was the cake. she said there is no other reasonable explanation that we would laugh and laugh about nothing. Now I believe that statement because we've tried every other dessert and none of them had the same effect on us. We go back whenever we know we can afford dessert and want to have a nice long laugh. I guess its not just the seafood that I like. I rather enjoy the cake too. We call it the double chocolate laugh cake."	16	20		36				3	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21091	8	"  Can you imagine life without laughter? Life without laughter is plain, dull, and boring. Laughter is an important part in life. There would be nothing to look forward to if laughing didn't exist. Laughter creates memories, relationships, and it fills in the awkward silence between two people.   Some people don't realize how important laughing is. Life without laughter is like life without water. I think that's how important laughter really is. The quote ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" is true, but laughing is more then just an element. It's way more important than that. Well I guess we could all live without laughter, but who would want to?  No laughter means no fun times like: swimming, water parks, ice skating, dancing, etc. Those fun things can lead to laughing. Without anything fun to do no one would look forward to tomorrow. Everyday would be a waste, if there wasn't any laughter in the world.   Some people might just think that laughing is just an element. Why is that? Laughter is important enough to be more than that. For example water is an element because it has something to do with the earth. It stands for the ocean. Laughter doesn't fit in that category. Laughing has such a huge impact on our lives. Laughing makes everything tens time better. Laughing creates memories, memories creates relationship. That's why laughter is an important part in any relationship. It's amazing how the smallest thing can make such a big difference in our lives."	15	19		34				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	4	4	4						
21094	8	" Everybody knows that long car rides can be both physically, and mentally exhausting. Picture a family of four : a mother, a father, and two daughters in @CAPS1. The father is behind the wheel, the mother is in the passenger seat, the older sister is on the left side of the back seat, and the younger sister on the right side. The sun is rising, and you're still on the road. The father is tired, after driving all night. The mother just woke up, yawning, and is wondering how much further until the destination. The sisters are looking out of their windows with extremely bored expressions. Even with cups of coffee, and loud music the atmosphere is still lifeless, extremely dull. What could possibly bring up this lifeless atmosphere? My guess, a form of entertainment. As a young child, I was always on the road. Moving from place to place, because of my father's work. At the time, we were living in a state known for it's snow. @ORGANIZATION1. Wonderful wildlife, breathtaking views, and beautiful landscapes, untouched by man. During the long winter months, the snow covered the ground, like a blanket on a bed. You could wake up in the morning with two new feet of snow. Although, despite living in a cold, isolated state, the summers were extremely hot. A total twist to someone unfamiliar with @ORGANIZATION1's weather. This was around a decade ago, so the enviroment might've changed, but nevertheless, it is still a breathtaking, beautiful state. After coming home from school on a cool @DATE1 day, my mother told me to start packing my room. I knew we were due to leave that @DATE1, but I was still hesitant on leaving my friends. Every time that we moved, I had to say a heart breaking goodbye to the friends I knew for the few years I lived there. I went to my room and started to pack for a long, long trip. My father came to me and told me we are moving by car. He asked my sister and I to go with him so he could pick up the uHaul. We went to check out the sizes, and the condition it was in. As usual, the trucks weren't in the best of condition for moving over a long distance, but it's better than nothing. My father drove it back home, with my sister and I, and my father started to put the packed boxes in the truck. My mother, my sister and I finished packing the rest of the boxes. The boxes with valuable, and mandatory items were stuffed in my mom's @CAPS1, along with our cats in their cages. After getting everything packed, and loaded, the hired uHaul employees drove the uHaul away to our new destination, @LOCATION2. Everyone had mixed emotions about leaving. My mother loved her neighbours, my father had some amazing coworkers, my sister and I made some spectaular friends, but we had to say our goodbyes to our friends. It's not the first time, and it's not the last time, but every time it still hurts. The times we spent together, will always being in our memories! Off we go! To our new temporary home. Driving from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2. The only thing that I didn't like, was that we had to be in @LOCATION2 in less than a week. A week to drive that long way? Less stops, more driving, and no fun, or sight seeing... a total drag!! It was really chatty and energetic in the beginning, but everyone soon got sick of being on the road. My sister's body didn't handle it well in the beginning, and neither did mine. Half way to @LOCATION2, all conversations stopped. The atmosphere started to fade, and so did the excitement. There was absolutely nothing to do in such a small area. I wanted to try to make the rest of the drive fun, so I started to sing in my tone deaf way. Since I was so young, my voice cracked midway through the song we were listening to, which caused in uproar of laughter! My mother started to say that I was simply adorable, and my father started to mock me. My sister started to sing, too, and before you knew it, everyone was singing along! Spirits were high, and everyone was having fun singing, and laughing. We started being more active after that, too! The rest of the trip down south was full of energy, and both time and distance passed quickly. It's always fun to spend time with family, but it'll be even better if you spend the time in a fun, exciting way! Make things fun, keep a positive, enjoyable outlook on everything!"	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4

She lives up in the woods and has a bunch of quads and motorcycles. All me and my cusin did was ride,have airsoft gun wars, and build giant forts. We planned on only staying one night but ended up staying three.   So the first night we were there we built a fort out in the woods. The fort seemed really good at the time, but the next morning we had other ideas. So the next morning we were getting ready to go outside and work on the fort. He got done before me so he went down there first. By the time I got half way down there I heard him scream and come running out of the fort. He was yelling @CAPS2 .....MICCCCEEEEE! So i figued we must have a little @CAPS2 problem and laughed to myself. So I walked in there to see for myself and sure enough there was a bunch of little @CAPS2 running around in there. That was the end of forts on the ground for us.  The next day we decided to have airsoft wars(guns that shoot little plastic bb's). We were having alot of fun shooting eachother mainly because it hurt. Like I said we were having alot of fun until I decided to try and hid up in a little tree. He found me and shot me I fell out of the tree and broke my gun. That was the end of the wars plus I almost broke my leg. I guess that was payback for laughing about the mouse thing.  After the wars ending we decided to go ride quads for a while. There are alot of trails around her house to ride on. He road a dirtbike and I rode a quad, I road a quad so I could make new trails. We made some really good trails up there. It was really muddy up there and very wet. While we were way out in the woods on a long ride I ran out of gas. So I had to walk all the way back to the house for gas then walk all the was back up there.  The last day we were up there we got up early. We wanted to go out and look for a place to build a new fort. This time we were going to make a tree fort so we didnt have to worry about critters. We spent from the time we got up till the time we went home on this awsome tree for. My granndpa has alot of wood that he dosn't use because he really to old to build anything so we never ran out of wood.                          "	20	20	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
21109	8	"  Laughter is a important part of my life.The best way to pass the time is laughing with friends and family. Think back on all the fun times you've had, if you do you'll find that most of them you are laughing. That's because laughter and fun go hand in hand. Everyone likes to have fun, therefor everyone likes to laugh. Laughing is good for you in many ways, it keeps you happy, helps maintain healthy relationships with others, and it relieves stress.  Also a lot of people laugh when there nervous, I'm one of these people. Especially when you're put in a awkward situation. Like when you have to do a speech in front of the class. I remember my first speech in high school, it's one of the scariest things I've done. It was @CAPS1 year and I slouched down in my chair and tried to get as low as possible so the teacher couldn't see me. I wouldn't make any eye contact with her either. I put my back pack in front of me in order to block her view. Every time she'd look around the room to pick another person to go I'd hold my breath and hope it wasn't me. Every time it wasn't me I would breath out in relief.  Finally it was getting down to a few people and I knew my doom would soon await me. I decided to take a chance and peek over my back pack to see who the teacher was looking at for her next victim. What I saw when I looked at her was her eyes meet mine. I tried to hind behind my back pack again but it was to late. She had already started to call my name out.  What should I do? I thought to myself. Should I tell her I'm not ready? Should I try to get out of it? I wiped my sweaty palms on my blue jeans.Then I stood up and started to walk toward the front of the room. I could feel a nervous knot building up in my stomach. With note card in hand, I began to speak. My words were quiet and shaky. My speech was about uniforms in school and if I agreed with them or not. As I went on I could feel myself start to trip over my words. Then I started to laugh, which I always do when I'm nervous. I could hear other people in the room start to snicker. I smiled and looked down at my note card and continued my speech. After wards I felt a big relief to get it over with. It wasn't perfect but laughing at myself when I messed up helped me get through it without falling apart from my nervous.  Although not everyone reacts this way, laughing can help relieve tension in some situations.But always be careful not to laugh in situations were it's not appropriate. It's not good for you to have constant stress. Finding things to laugh about can be a good way to relieve stress. Laughing might not be the right behavior to get a A on your speech but it did help me keep it together to make it through. Laughter is important to everyone. It's a good way to have fun with others and it keeps you happy. Laughing is a good way to relieve stress. Your relationships will grow stronger if you find things in common to laugh about. If you learn to laugh you're sure to have a fun and happy life, I know I do. "	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21114	8	" Have you ever been laughing at something that someone said, and then began laughing harder at, not the joke, but at a person whose laugh was almost more humorous than the joke itself? Then were you put into a good mood after the funny laughing occurred, when just before that you could have been in the world's worst mood? Laughter is the cure for almost anything from being in a bad mood to crying because you're sad. It can also help make the mood in the room brighter or simply it makes any awkward moment disappear. One bright @DATE1 day, @PERSON1 called me and asked if I wanted to long board down to @PERSON2's and get some lunch with her. Of course I wanted to because I'm always up for my typical @PERSON2's order of a chocolate malt milkshake and some croutons and ranch. I jogged to her house down the block and we long boarded down to @PERSON2's in downtown @CAPS1. On the way to @PERSON2's I shared with @PERSON1 how I had not had a good day so far and how I needed to be cheered up. She was feeling the same way. When we arrived at @ORGANIZATION1's we were both excited to get seated so we could catch up with each others lives and eat. When we walked inside we noticed how crowded it seemed to be that day as we waited for a table. After getting seated we noticed an older couple sitting in the booth behind us, some kids from our school in the booth front of us, and a man and women across the aisle. @PERSON1 ordered a strawberry milkshake and a burger with fries, and I ordered my usual. After the lady took our order and left, @PERSON1 and I started telling each other the reasons for our bad moods. She was in a bad mood because her friend @PERSON3 was not treating her right. I was in a bad mood because my friend @CAPS2 was mad at me for something that never happened.  We were both quite upset and frankly we were in no laughing mood. When all of a sudden we heard what sounded like a mixture of a goose's honking and a donkey's braying. We turned around to find it was a lady's laughter. I looked at @LOCATION1 and she looked at me and we started busting up laughing. This went on for about @NUM1 minutes straight. We both could not believe a sound like that could come out of any human being's mouth and it was probably the loudest laugh I've ever heard. We also loved the fact that all of this is happening at a public place with all these people around, and the lady was just setting herself up for being made fun of. @PERSON1 and I continued to laugh at the lady for how she was laughing and it somehow started to relieve our bad moods. @PERSON1 started smiling a little more and as for me, I couldn't stop smiling and laughing.   Laughter has an unusual way of putting people in a good mood or relieving them of their bad moods. Regardless if the laugh is a normal little chuckle or an unnatural sound coming out of someone's mouth, laughter brings people together and it's great way to turn a awkward moment into a memorable moment. Someone once said, ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" and that person knew what they were talking about."	20	19	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
21116	8	" What is one of the most important parts of a relationship? Laughter would be one of the most important part of a relationship in my mind. Such as my relationship with @PERSON1, and @ORGANIZATION1. We are always laughing almost every moment we are together someones is always making a joke.

Last but not lest we had the funniest @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, that night we will never be forgotten. When we first arrived at @LOCATION2 our couch left the keys on the bus after we locked it all up. One of the girls noticed when she went out to get her ipod. We all tried to think of some ways out of this. We first tried to put @PERSON1 through the window. But that unfortunately did not work so well because we could not get any of the windows open. Our couch had to call someone to bring us another set of keys.  After the game our cheer squad went to @ORGANIZATION2. Because before the game she promised we could go to get some cookie dough if we were good and didn't complain about having to sit on the stands and cheer. When pulled up to @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 and I ran out of the bus screaming as loud as we could. One of the people who worked at @ORGANIZATION2 said that we could not run in the building. We followed the rules and started doing cartwheels and round offs down the halls instead. We got stopped again and they didn't mean do cartwheels or round offs down the halls either. as we were walking around to find the music box we stumbled onto a baby stroller so we took turns pushing each other in it. Turns out that's not allowed in @ORGANIZATION2 either. We got sent back to our coach. Unfortunate for us we stumbled on to another interesting thing it was a short little dresses on a clothing rack. @PERSON1 and I put them over our cheer uniforms. As @PERSON1 was about to take a picture a girl who worked there came up behind us. @PERSON1 the good friend she is ran off with out telling us. @PERSON1 decides to take the picture instead, after the lady saw what we were doing we got kicked out.  The last crazy event of the night was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. For thous of you who don't know what that is it is simply when a bus stops at a stop light and everyone besides the driver of course gets out and runs around the bus like crazy people. We were just about to leave @LOCATION1 when the light turns red. I was standing by the door waiting for a light to turn red. i had to beg our couch to let us out as soon as she opened the door I ran out as fast as I could. Sadly the the road was all muddy which caused me to fall straight onto my butt. Two other people were behind me and they helped me up and then we ran around the bus. But the light turned green as soon as I rounded the corner. The people behind us were passing and we were getting honked at and not in the good way either. Honestly no body cared we were having so much fun to even think about the other people. As @CAPS7 another girl from the squad rounded the corner she fell straight onto her face. Then when everyone was back on the bus the light turned red again. we waited on the bus for it to turn green. @CAPS7 and I were covered in mud. Everyone one was taking the mud off of @CAPS7 and I then put it on them self's. But since everybody was rubbing the mud it just got really dry and uncomfortable.  In conclusion laughter is an important part of a relationship. With out it our squad wouldn't have half the funny memories we do. That night was just one of the most funniest all of the things that happened that night were just so humorous. Including getting locked out of the bus, getting kicked out of @ORGANIZATION2, and the best of all the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. That night will never be forgotten by me or any of the other people that were there."	17	20		37				4	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4

For example, @CAPS1 you go on your first date with this wonderful guy that you are so excited but yet nervous because you don't know how he is going to act. You have all these thoughts going through your mind like, will he like what I'm wearing? Will he think I'm beautiful? What do i talk about? and trust me i bet you he is think the exact same things you are. You get to the restaurant and hes a gentlemen, he pulls your chair out for you and comes off sweet as can be. The first thing he dose is make you laugh. Laughing really changes things doesn't it? makes you feel you know comfortable.    Now lets take it back. You show up with guy he says, ""hello"" you sit down and he talks about the most boring subjects, doesn't smile talks kinda of quiet, makes you bring up all the subjects to talk about.Witch couple do you think is more likely to go forward? The first example right? laughing lights up everything smiling makes people happy and it feels comforting.   laughter and smiles i know falls under the same category i mean @CAPS1 you smile your happy. @CAPS1 you laugh you have to smile and usually @CAPS1 your laughing your happy about something or someone. i love @CAPS1 people make me laugh and smile it makes you feel like everything's going to be ok, @PERSON1 @CAPS1 it's not. people don't realize part of communication is smiling and laughter, they kinda ignore and come as kinda, well ya know boring witch makes a person no fun at all. Everyone has to have some joy in there life, and if not there are people out there that can help.  Do you notice gloomy people? People that are sad all the time kind of afraid of life? Maye been through a lot of hard times. Gosh I cant even imagine what some people are going through what some people are going through these days but anyway, smile lightens there heart. Makes them feel just maybe not much but better than they were feeling. just by passing on a face showing that you don't know them but maybe you can feel that there not doing well, or are hurting.   I work at a restaurant in my town here in @LOCATION1 as a waitress. I love my job and i enjoy making people smile and laugh, it makes them feel comfortable. This lady walked in my work and it was a late after noon. She we looking around at all the other customers, but it wasn't the people that were sitting with here sisters or brothers even kids. It was the couples she was looking at she looked very unhappy and it seemed to me that she probably was in a divorcee or break up she just looked very sad. knowing myself all i wanted to do was help her even put a smile on her face because i care. I went over to her table and sat down by here, remember i don't even know this lady. I looked at her and said "" you know everything is going to be alright"" and smiled at her. Within seconds her face lit up it was like the whole restaurant had lit up. She put a smile on her face. You know its the little things in life that make everything ok.

21120	8	" When I think of laughter, I think back to the wonder years. Although the memories are foggy, i can still recall the times where I believed friendship had no end and that laughter was the common cure to every battle. Thinking back to the @DATE2 I was twelve, I remember @CAPS7 adventures pushing me upward towards the sky. Free spirited and lacking reality, I was an unstoppable soul. I was @CAPS2 alone though. Through adventures and explorations, I brought @CAPS7 trustworthy opponent. Her name was @PERSON1 and she was @CAPS7 best friend.  @PERSON1 lived out in the country, where the grass grew tall and the land came in acres. Through forests and streams, you could find our hideaway from the world; We called @CAPS3 our wonderland. Now, the small stream with a bridge is nothing but a forgotten place. On a typical @DATE1 @TIME1 in @DATE3, I drove up to @PERSON2 to @PERSON1's house. Walking in her front door, I automatically smelled fresh cinnamon scones drizzled with honey. The sweet smell sent shivers up @CAPS7 spine. @PERSON1 came down the stairs and greeted me with a hug. She wore her long, dark hair in braids and was wearing a white sundress. Her brown, shimmering skin glittered against the sunlight and her dark brown eyes sent me a happy glare. I envied her with @CAPS7 heart and soul. Next to her, i was just the simple, blond girl with a blotchy skin tone. In one moment, she fled to the window and looked out at the perfect, blue ski. ""@CAPS1 wow, finally @DATE2 has come along,"" she whispered and then exploded,"" @CAPS2 another day spent with grumpy, sleepless peers and no more stuffy classrooms or annoying teachers. @CAPS6.. its the first day of many!"" We burst into laughter as I made fun of her poetic outburst, but we both new every word of @CAPS3 was true. Sighing, I looked at her breathtaking, dress one last time and ran out to the field in her backyard. @PERSON1 grabbed a red cardigan and followed me, holding a basket in her hand as if she were little red riding hood.  I frolicked through the meadow like I was a radiant fox chasing after its pray. When I stopped for breath, i encountered the wind blowing the tall, wispy grass in rhythmic motions around me. Racing towards our secret place, I looked back only once to to find @PERSON1. As I turned towards @CAPS7 destination again, a branch met @CAPS7 vision and knocked me down painfully. Blood trickled down @CAPS7 chin and left crimson droplets of blood in the green grass. I breathed in, choking on the salty fluid and then realized she was standing there. Like a worried hare, @PERSON1 sprang to @CAPS7 side and helped me to the house. We made our way into the upstairs bathroom.   Standing at her bathroom sink, I wept small tears. In the mirror I could see a belligerent looking girl with a bloody slash across her chin and red, misted eyes. The pain was @CAPS2 @CAPS4 made me cry; @CAPS3 was @CAPS7 appearance that had me down. People would asked for days ""@CAPS4 is on your face"" and ""@CAPS5! How did that @NUM1 came to @CAPS7 side and squeaked, ""@CAPS6, how are you?""@CAPS7 face turned to a bright shade of red in a way that I might explode. I turned to @PERSON1 and in one fluid breath I burst out, ""@CAPS8! Wonderful! Ecstatic! Before this, I had a boring, simple look going. Now, I will look even worse with this terrible blemish! I hate how gorgeous you are @PERSON1. You are exotic, distinguished and everything about you seems extremely, perfect!""@CAPS7 friend just stood there and took in every word. A confused look came across her face but slowly turned to a crooked grin. Suddenly, @PERSON1 burst out into laughter. Embarrassed, I walked to the door wanting to leave that very second, but she grew silent and look hold of @CAPS7 arm. Shaking her off, I continued down the stairs. ""@CAPS10,"" she called out to me, "" I'm @CAPS2 agreeing with you in anyway. @CAPS6, you @MONTH1 have a small cut across your chin, but you have always been beautiful and I feel like a simple, field mouse next to you. The way your blond, thin hair becomes perfect ringlets and the way your freckles highlight your amazing, turquoise eyes. I have always been jealous of you! That's why I'm laughing!"" I took this in for a second and then erupted into laughter. Racing up the stairs, I came to her with a big, bear hug and laughed some more. Everything I had ever thought about her beauty and mine, wasn't at all relevant. Having thought this, the pain of @CAPS7 cut became apparent to me. Lee, her dad, fixed me up with his sewing skills and each stitch, I laughed along with @PERSON1 to get through the pain. Seven stitches and a nasty scar, remind me everyday that laughter gets you through the worst while @CAPS3 builds an everlasting, friendship.     "	25	25		50				5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5						
21122	8	" The wind rose and fell, whipping against the side of the house with full force. My mom said she had never seen such a fierce storm before in her life. It shook the house making it creak in odd places, like the floor boards. My @CAPS2 @PERSON1 sat at the kitchen table contemplating, worrying. They had rental houses acres off that were surrounded by trees, the ground was so soft ,so saturated by the rain and flooding that had taken over the valley. There were already hundreds of trees that had come uprooted there were bound to be more. The little homesteads that rested off of @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 including my papa's were well built weathered farm houses,most were surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of acres of land. You would be surprised to find someone out there with less then @NUM1 acres of land. It's wheat fields mostly, but you can easily find fields of corn, alfalfa, you'll find rows and rows of blueberries so big only @NUM2 can fit on the palm or your hand. It is literally paradise on earth, a small piece of heaven that was thrown down to earth by either accident or purposely. The sun is so bright and the sky is the clearest, most crisp blue. When weather rolls in giant fluffy clouds make the sky look like it's dappled with giant pieces of cotton. All this stretches over land so flat you wonder if it could possibly be real. I have spent so many wonderful , laughter filled summers there. Running bare foot through the fields, playing in the large expansion of lush, green grass. Feeding the goats, chickens, and pigs with my siblings. On @DATE1 my mom said she had never seen a place so beautiful turn so ugly in such a short period of time. My mom says if she had known what was going to happen that day she never would have let them get in that car. My papa, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 @PERSON2 pulled out of the driveway. Since it was a small car my @CAPS2 volunteered to ride in the back. The storm had been showing it's vicious temper for over two hours, and it showed no signs of letting up. They had set out to see what damage had been done on their acres of land, to see what needed fixing once this storm moved on over the mountains. There is no explanation, no one understood why my @CAPS3 walked away with not even a scratch on his body. No one knows how the tree fell or why it only landed on the back end of the car, but it did. Gods hand had swept down and caused destruction. My @CAPS2 was killed instantly, my papa was seriously injured but alive. He spent weeks in the hospital, during those weeks the news of the accident spread like wildfire as news does in a small town. Everyone loved my @CAPS2, she was social butterfly that fluttered from person to person , laughing, talking , sharing tears, and joy. She knew everybody, and everybody knew her. The heavens cried and howled that day, rain drops fell so heavily it felt as if the whole world was crying, crying just for you just to share your grief. It's painful, to lose someone so dear to your heart. My papa cried, he sobbed until he had no strength left to feel any emotion at all. he loved her so much, he needed her . Lightning struck the giant oak that stood tall and proud in my papa's backyard that day. It was the same tree that held my grandparents initials. The lightning split the top of the giant oak clean in two. Everyone saw it as a symbol, sign of how my papa and @CAPS2 had been struck apart quickly and forcefully. But, days before my papa returned home from the hospital, my dad climbed that giant oak and chained the severed part back together. With that my dad had made a symbol of his own, saying you will always be together just not physically, but you will never be truly apart. The day my papa returned home he saw the giant oak, and for the first time in weeks a glimmer of understanding shone in his eyes. A small amount of hope had settled over everything once again. Her funeral was a nice affair, elegant, simple, beautiful, just like her. The whole town came, they reminisced for hours, telling stories about my @CAPS2 and her crazy yet lovable nature. Then from across the room it came. Small at first then growing ever louder. Laughter. A smile, yes there were tears with that laughter, but it was laughter all the same I've never seen the saying "" laughter is the best medicine"" put to justice better. My @CAPS2 was one person who saw laughter, love, faith and hope as necessities in life. She brought joy to so many people, and now they were returning the favor."	25	21		46				5	5	5	5	5	5	5	4	5	5	4	4						
21129	8	"       Laughter In A Relationship The most important thing in a relationship is laughter. Laughter is something we all need and it keeps us going with the world and the duties we do all day because we get frustrated a lot of times. So one thing that helps us is laughter. If someone is upset the person might watched a comedy movie or read a comic about funny or humorous characters. But many people like talking to someone when they are upset and need a uplift from them. When I was once upset regarding my school work and about not having a job. I went out for a walk after an argument with my work mother. About my grades being dropped. My mom got quite angry and my dad was also very upset with me because they knew I was much more capable than I showed in my grades. My parents knew I wanted to do a job to buy things what I wanted. They didn't think it appropriate to linger around about having a job so much and not care about my grades.When I was walking along the lake side I heard someone playing a guitar and he played it so beautifully that I wanted to meet that person instantly. I tried to find him but I couldn't and at last I just set down and wondered who that person might be. So suddenly a boy came to me with a guitar and asked me what time is it. I told him the time and asked him where he learn t to play guitar such beautifully. So he told me that he is interested in playing guitar for a long time and he wants to join a band.We both shared our feeling and we couldn't even understand that the things we never told anyone else we were telling each other  @CAPS1 after that meeting we came close friends and we met everyday. He knew I was quite tensed so he used to play guitar for me and we sang songs together. He also told me jokes and I knew he was doing all this just for me and I sometimes just kept quite and didn't respond to his jokes. He got more tensed that I was not laughing or smiling. But I didn't realize that by doing this I was really making him hurt.But he never lost hope in me and he kept on telling me funny stories and we talked over the phone whole night just so that he could make my tensions a bit less and make me laugh. So one day he took me out for lunch at @ORGANIZATION1's because he knew it was my favorite place and I loved going their. He took me to a comedy movie on superheroes but neither of them were making me laugh. All the time I was just in his arms. But after the movies he took me to the most beautiful place and it was near a beach and the whole place was decorated by colorful lights and we were sitting down on a swing and talking. Now he knew how he could make me happy and he told me jokes and we read comic books and surprisingly I started loving his jokes and the comics we read. Whenever I would meet him he would do something special for me and made me laugh. He once got dressed down as clown and tried to juggle balls but he couldn't do it so well and i laughed at him so badly. I know it was being rude to laugh at him but I loved spending time with him.  One day he came to my home and we were talking and he held my hands and proposed me. I was really happy to hear that and he brought me the most beautiful ring ever. He proposed me and took me out for a drive and gave me some advice in a very respectfully manner, not in a intention that he is putting me down. But I had never seen a person like him and he he told me that laughing and smiling is good for life. N o matter what happens tomorrow why should we care about it today when we have such a beautiful life waiting for us. We must live the way we want and not force our selves to change just to get serious in life. He held my hand and took me his arms and said @CAPS2 matter how much we love each other but laughter is important in a relationship I looked at him and asked him why'd? So he replied we'd must be happy and to be healthy and to be with each other. After we had some time there he dropped me home and told me live life because who knows if we will be alive tomorrow. From that moment I realized that he was right and I looked at life from a different perspective from that day and decided to live life in a better way so that I laugh and enjoy."	19	17		36				4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	3	3						
21142	8	" Laughter between two people is one of the ways you know if you are really good friends. Laughter between each other is what cheers you up if your having a really bad day. It is the reason you know you have a great bond in your relationship. Laughter is the bond between my two best friends and I. It is why we have been friends for so long. One of my best friends is named @PERSON1 and the other is @PERSON3. I have been friends with them for @NUM1 years now. We are all very close and we do every thing together. We hang out together, we play soccer together, we live close together, and we laugh together. @PERSON1 loves to go camping with her family in the @DATE1. The past @NUM2 years she has taken @PERSON3 and I along. @CAPS2 last trip I had been texting a lot on the trip @CAPS3 i was the only one who had service at the camp site. @PERSON1's mom had yelled at me for texting so much, which had mad me kinda angry. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 had agreed with @PERSON1's mom and yelled at me to. I yelled back @CAPS3 I didn't like how @CAPS1 were all ganging up on me. I said ""I know, I'm getting off the phone. Just shut up!"" @CAPS1 were both really surprised that I said that and became intimidated. We all stopped talking and things were really awkward for a little while. Then our friend @PERSON2 who was also on the trip with us had fallen flat on his face while he was trying to do a cartwheel. @PERSON3, @PERSON1 and I all tried not to laugh @CAPS3 we were mad at each other, but we couldn't help it, it was just too funny. So we burst out laughing together and realized that we shouldn't be mad at each other. We knew there was no way that a little fight like that was going to stop us from being friends. We all hugged each other and said ""I'm sorry."" @CAPS2 is why laughter is such a great thing, @CAPS3 there's nothing better than knowing you have friends that are there for you and can always make you laugh even when your mad at them. It can make your bond between each other stronger and can really repair any damage that has broken a relationship. In my case laughter has fixed many problems like @CAPS2 and always will."	18	18		36				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
21144	8	" Close people to you enjoy the moment you have shared with them and remembering it back brings laughter for what had occurred in that moment. Laughter brings people you have known from a long time together because you have had a feeling for that person and for the moment. Laughing at the memories that were spent with that person and enjoying it can make you closer to that person and it can be important to that relationship. In fact, it has happened to me before; laughter came to me when i saw a special video from my past. It was when one of my favorite cousins was two years old and i was three years old at a family party. My cousin was very chubby and with straight hair, but that day she was very sick from fever. I was very different because i had curly hair and was short. We both had a dress on, but the dresses had different styles. Then everyone at the party was having fun and we were, too. The video got to the part when my cousin and i were bouncing up and down grabbing our dress and making a show for everyone at the party. In that time we were suppose to be dancing. It seemed we were having to much fun that day. Afterward, my youngest brother came close to where we were dancing to see us dance, but he was caring with him a cup of soda. Then one of the grown ups gets up from its chair and bumps into him and he drops his cup of soda which splashed my cousin and me. All of our dress were wet, dirty ,and sticky from the soda. We both stopped dancing and sat down on the ground and started to cry. My aunt and my mom changed us to something else, but later when we saw my brother we were so mad that we didn't answer him when he asked us something or wanted to talk to us for that fact. Later on, we were having fun again and talked to him back again. Finally, the video stopped. It's important that laughter gets people closer to someone because together they're having a great moment while laughing. My cousin and i watching the video remembering our memories made us laugh from what happened to both of us. We have shared the same feelings and the innocent we were at that age. We noticed how much we had changed right now from all the funny times we had enjoyed together. We did realize that it was not my brothers fault for splashing us with soda. Laughing from all the moments we shared helped my cousin and me to be more united. Obviously, in different time in life you react in a different way, but laughing in that moment or later on gets people together. Sometimes in time feelings are different, but laughing is important because you're sharing the moment of happiness with someone. I remember events from my past with my family and we get closer to each other and have some laughter for the happy moments.  "	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21182	8	" Have @CAPS3 ever been in that mood were @CAPS3 just can not stop laughing, and no matter what, @CAPS3 just can't stop? That is the problem my good friend, @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and I have when we are together. Most of the time we are just talking about random things and we both find it hilarious. Luckily, for the teachers, we only have two classes together. In both of those classes we sit next to each other though. So the teachers didn't luck out too much.  Just the other day, in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, we were allowed to move are seats around and have that be our new spot in the class. The girl that was sitting next to me moved and sat next to @PERSON1. Now, @ORGANIZATION1 doesn't like this girl very much, so I spoke up and said ""@PERSON1, @CAPS3 can sit next to me!"". @PERSON1 grabbed her stuff in an unusually quick manner, and came and sat next to me. The funny thing was when she sat down she said ""@CAPS3 saved my life."". For some reason @PERSON1 and I just started laughing non-stop. We couldn't control it. To be honest, it wasn't that funny. I guess it was just in the way she said I saved her life. I'm glad @PERSON1 sits next to me in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. With out her, it would be so boring.  In @CAPS6, we sit next to each other and we have a good time. Our @CAPS6 class is at the end of the day so we are just ready to go home by then. @PERSON1 and I sit next to each other and when we are taking notes, @PERSON1 and I pass notes back-and-forth to each other. She and I talk about everything, from the predicaments a teenage girl runs into in high school, to boys and parents. I can pretty much tell her everything, and that's a good friend. Over the years @PERSON1 and I have become closer and closer friends. Last year, she and I had at least three or four classes together. So we have been in classes together previously. @PERSON1 and I have become more acquainted and more open with things. I tell her everything and she tells me everything. One reason why I think we've become good friends is because she and I find the same things funny. We have the same interests in things.She is a good friend and I'm glad she's my friend . Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I am going to definitely have to agree with that."	15	16		31				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	3						
21188	8	" Allot of people say that laughter is a big part of any relationship, and i agree allot of people don't always laugh and in every relationship laughter is a big component to make someones day of the greatest day they have ever had. There is always someone who is having a bad time in school or at home or any other place and when you see someone like that you should always cheer them up like saying something nice or just even saying something like hope you have a good day @DATE3, give them a smile so that can put there bad thing that is avoiding them from laughing aside and you have just made there day by sharing your smile and laughter with them. Allot of people need someone they can go to when they are going through a very hard situation or problem they are going through that they cant go through it alone in there home or even at school and they need someone they can talk to and share there feelings with a shoulder they can cry on and that always makes someone feel good letting all that pain and inner self out to others we all need to make someone who is going through a hard time smile and laugh and that is always something very healthy in a relationship and it is a way to offer that person who is in pain or sad have e healing. This reminds me of a true story i know because i was there. One time there was a girl who i had in my elementary school she was a very happy girl she shared her laughter and happiness with others she was someone anyone could go to when they had a problem or they just needed someone to talk to she was one of the nicest girl in school everyone liked her and she tended to always show love and respect to others it always seemed as if her life was so perfect she had no worries she was just full of joy and she was only child in her family so of course her parents would always give her what she wanted or at least that's what we all thought. It had been a @DATE1 and we it came to be @DATE2 and we were all in school except this girl, she never missed a day of school so it was very strange for her not to be there, but just as every other person she must have been sick so that's what we thought except she missed another day and then another, and another, so i was starting to think she had moved away and she was probably never coming back, but the next week after that she showed up i was very happy to see her i had missed that girl except there was something very different about her she wasn't the same she wasn't laughing or smiling anymore she had lost that sparkle that made her so different. I thought to myself ""what is wrong with her?"" i finally found out that she had been gone because her mom had past away i was so sad i didn't know what to say she was just so happy and from one day to another she didn't have her mom anymore i thought i have both of my parents and she doesn't i should share the happiness she had share with me and others right back to her and be there for her now that she was gong through the hardest time of her life. That's why being happy and sharing your happiness with others always is the greatest thing you can do for someone because you never know what kind of things there going through and they need someone to make them smile and laugh."	17	20		37				4	4	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21192	8	      Have you ever laughed so hard that you peed?That @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not have happened to me. In my story I'm going to talk about the funniest time I have ever had with my best friend @CAPS1.       How it all started was that it was my best friends birthday and she was going to spend the night at her grandmas house. She invite only me to come with her so I couldn't say no. @CAPS1's grandma owned a @CAPS2 @CAPS3. She was old and was in a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 club. I don't know about you but it always seems to me that old people have to be in some kinda of club. So anyways in her her club what the did was go on trips. @CAPS1 and I thought that would be fun to go on a trip. So we meant everyone at @ORGANIZATION1.         @CAPS1's grandma let us go intro the store to buy drinks for that trip. I wanted @CAPS4. The bottle was really cool. It had a top like a water bottle would have. I got the red kind cause it the best. We got are drinks and @CAPS1's grandma said to go to the car while she talked to the adults about the trip.      So here is the funny part of the story. I got into the car first. I was pretty thirsty so I decided to unscrew the cap it pulled open to paper back on the sell. I twisted the cap back on and took a drink. Mean while @CAPS1 got into the car and closed the door behind her cause her grandma was talking to the adults. While she was closing it she got her hair caught in the door. She was laughing and yelling at me to come help her. I was laughing too hard to come help her. I had my drink between my legs and the cap was open and remember its like a water bottle cap. I laughed so hard that I squeezed my legs together and my juice went straight into the front seat. It didn't get and were else just into her grandma seat. It was like a rocket it was so funny. @CAPS1 with her head still stuck in the door asked what that notice was on the seat. I told her it was my juice. Then was both started laughing.         I don't know why but @CAPS1 just pulled on her head and her head was no longer stuck. The was like ten pieces of her hair stuck in the car door. She looked at the seat and said we have to tell her grandma about it. I didn't want her to be mad at me cause her seats were white. I thought it would stain. But we ended up telling her. She told us to go get napkins from the bathroom. The whole time we were going to the bath room me and @CAPS1 were just laughing so hard. We cleaned up the mess and I didn't get in trouble.         I guess that I have never peed my pants laughing but I almost did that day. After that day me and my best friend @CAPS1 always laugh at that story. I am so glad we went on an old people @CAPS2 @CAPS3 club trip.                       	15	20		35				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21202	8	"Warm @CAPS1 Laughter @MONTH1 be the best medicine, but it @MONTH1 also be the best glue. When one laughs, especially with another, it brings a sense of relaxation and happiness. Laughter is a release of amusement, and that literally means ""not thinking"". In this moment, people open themselves up and it brings a warm feeling of the heart that is shared between each other. Without this connection or ability to jest, people begin to think too much and become overly critical about relationships. To flirt is to make fun or light of a situation, the point of this is to put people at ease so they @MONTH1 open up. Flirting can consist of many things, such as joking, impressing, or complementing; usually this leads to laughing or excessive giggling. When this warming connection begins, so does the bond between the people, such as it was with my own girlfriend. I just came off the back end of a hurtful experience with another girl, so I had become tough at heart. I was a bit of a nervous kid, so when she started to be pleasant and kind to me, I started to grow out of my shell and laugh with her. Our first date was to see some silly yo-yo man who had come to their church. It was a great way to start off what we have been building now for two years, as well as comfortable setting to meet the parents.   Sometimes the key to opening up, or bonding, is to make a fool of oneself. It's hard to laugh with someone who is being prideful or too analytical; laughter is a crucial mental break from routine thinking. Being a dork @MONTH1 just be the best way to be in a healthy relationship. My relationship is very well balanced between supporting each other, being critical, and being idiots. I take sacrifices to make her laugh, and she does the same for me, but mostly this results in both of us being profusely happy and laughing together. Being a man is not the same as being stubborn or powerful, I feel it's more about being open and compassionate. To be open enough to have someone to laugh with, one has to be able to laugh at themselves. Laughter is an @CAPS2, a socially transforming device, and it spreads rapidly.  The same goes for a simple social gathering. Does anyone become the ""life of the party"" without laughing at themselves? They are typically the ones going out of their way to be ridiculous for everyone else to see, because once it starts, it spreads exponentially. Being comfortable is the foundation of having a good time, otherwise people are acting paranoid, refuse to participate, and downright seem cold. Laughter's bright tone is a good way to get people comfortable and relaxed. Think of people as @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is difficult to pour and spread around when it's cold, it's thick and condensed. You can't do much with cold @CAPS1, so you have to warm it up. One can't heat @CAPS1 up in a flash or else it could become tasteless, but once it is gradually heated it becomes easy to spread and very useful. This warm @CAPS1 is quick to mix with about anything and sticks to things all the same. My relationship has been sticky, sweet, and warming beyond compare, but nothing without a little work, or a little laughter.  "	25	20		45				5	5	5	5	5	5	4	4	5	5	4	4						
21220	8	" Well it all started with the day he came to the airport. Missing him so much hardly ever getting to see him or have him return your phone calls like a @CAPS2 brother should, but it is always a blessing t see him and have him over for the holidays its amazing how he found time during the @DATE1 to come and visit us. it was well fortunate because now i didn't have to hear him cry all the time on its too cold and wet out here. So it was pretty good but because it was the @DATE1 it was normally about the time i go out and hang out with my friends and girls and now that started talking to this really beautiful girl that lives right around the corner from my house i was dying to go out and be with her but since time was really short with him i had to put my @CAPS2 brother first before anything.But then again every chance i got man i left and sneaked away to go see her. she was so beautiful so funny man she was s perfect to me it was crazy like a dream. I would tell my brother all the time about her. He would always tell me even if she was real it was impossible for a girl to be like that. It was the first day he spent the night everybody was so happy in the house from the time we picked up from the airport to the drive home talking making jokes about how much he changed how tight his cloths are. It was good we even stopped at burger-vile to get a couple burgers cause fat boy was so hungry all the time non stop eating. We shortly arrived home and the look on my little brother and sisters face was priceless there mouths open so wide like if they just saw god. As they came running towards he wasn't so prepared for it slowly still putting his bags down by the door he gets tackled and ruined over by a @NUM1 year old girl and a @NUM2 year old boy it was funny seeing them so happy and excited it was a surprise for them we were only supposed to get gas ha ha ha. Then after we sat down and talked all night when we rented movies earlier that day to watch, as a family but like my family nothing ever happens accordingly or on time. You know when your having fun and laughing you don't want it to end and you forget about everything let time go by and keep on doing what you do. But as time catch's up to you ad running on low energy because you been excited all day to see your @CAPS2 brother and to share story's tell jokes and laugh having a good time you get sleepy and in some real need of some rest like sleep in your bed in the covers and with the lights off, in silence. Oh good times having pleasant dreams of food and girls. Most of the time there put together in one hole dream after dream ha ha ha. Then we woke up had a great time shared some laughs in the morning cracking joke nonstop. Talking hanging out i got to take my @CAPS2 brother to some party's of mine which really scared my parents but it was funny at the same time cause before we left my mom was like okay we letting you g out don't get yourself into any shit @CAPS1 don't alright your dads going to b picking you up so don't be acting stupid look after your brother okay and right after i said yeah alright bet. i questioned it and was like what the hell? why do i have to look after my @CAPS2 brother he should be looking out for me. but i guess that's what made it funny. ever since then we had a good time and that's where this story ends with me saying goodbye at the airport to him. hoping that one day soon ill see him again soon."	15	15		30				3	3	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21222	8	" laughter is the best medicine,well that is what some people say. I think that laughter is good for you and if you are in a relationship laughing is really good for that. @CAPS1 here are some of the ways laughing is good for you. laughing in a relationship is good because if you can't laugh together you probably not be together. If you can't laugh with your boyfriend/girlfriend you will not have a very good relationship with him/her. @CAPS1 don't be scared to laugh a little with your boyfriend or girlfriend. I think and I think most people will say the same thing to that if you want a good relationship you need to laugh.laughing is good when you are sad because you can get told a joke and if it is a good joke it can make you feel better.It works at school to you laugh with your friends and all your stress will go away.if we all just laugh about more things and not take things @CAPS1 sonorously we would not have @CAPS1 many bad stuff happen in the world. we will all get along better and not get in fights in school,wouldn't have @CAPS1 many people in jail or person,   @CAPS1 that is why i think laughter is the best medicine for people who are sad,stress,and in relationship. But you think what you want but this is what i think is good about laughing."	15	12		27				3	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	2						
21223	8	" Have you ever laughed so hard that you started crying? Were you alone? Most of the time when you are laughing about something you are with someone else. I believe that laughter brings two people closer because it's something you guys both share, a moment you and that other person can think of and picture over and over again in the future. Even if that person is miles away. I can remember it as if it just happened a couple weeks ago. I had just finished a conversation with @CAPS3 mom. I went into @CAPS3 room and unplugged @CAPS3 little black phone from the charger. I opened it and a blinking light flickered saying ""@NUM1 missed calls from @PERSON1."" I called her back to apologize for missing her phone call. I heard someone pick up, but nobody talked on the other end. "" @CAPS1, @PERSON1 you there?"" I had asked hoping I would get a reply out of her. I sure got a reply just not the one I was wanting. She started bawling. Trying to catch her breathe, the words barely escaping her mouth. ""@CAPS2, @CAPS3 grandpa just died.""  @CAPS3 heart sank into @CAPS3 stomach. @CAPS3 eyes started to water up and @CAPS3 throat started to close, making it harder to breathe. @CAPS3 voice was all shaky and rough. I said, ""I'm sorry @PERSON1."" and I started crying. Us both crying wasn't make anything better anytime soon. She then had explained that he had a heart attack and asked me how something could happen to someone that didn't deserve it. I didn't have an answer to give her though. I had never been in the position she was in. Who was I to know what to say, or do to help her? So I thought hard of what to say to her that would clear her mind a little bit. @CAPS3 brain started hurting when I finally found something from the heart to tell her, something I would want to hear if @CAPS3 grandpa passed away.  I said in a low calming voice, ""there isn't much I can tell you because I don't know from experience, but you're family needs you right now as much as you need them. Think about the good times you had with you're grandpa @CAPS4. The laughs you guys enjoyed together. I heard a slight giggle underneath her sniffling. She started telling me a story about how every year her family would take a weekend beach trip. How it was a time for her family to bond and how she would miss it. When she told me that story @CAPS3 heart warmed and the corners of @CAPS3 mouth went up a little. I was proud of myself for sticking in there and being strong for @CAPS3 friend. Even though @PERSON1 will never see her grandpa @CAPS4 again she will always have him with her. Through memories, with in her heart, and by laughter."	20	18	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3
21227	8	" For me there are so many parts in my life that involve laughter. Having fun and laughing are the main things that I do in my life. When I laugh I feel happy, so whenever I'm sad or mad people can always tell a joke or something to make me giggle and then I'm happy again. I love making people laugh. Sometimes when I try and make people laugh I tell a joke but I'm not that funny. When I just be myself, people laugh. I guess I can be funny without even trying.  I have amazing friends, I mean absolutely amazing, although we have our rough days I still love them and thank @CAPS1 for them everyday. My friends and I are always cooking up some way to have fun, and every time we find something to do @CAPS2 always turns out to be funny. Even the little things, such as facial expressions, the way we pronounce a word, or even the way we eat our food makes us laugh. @CAPS2's actually pretty ridiculous. When my friends and I try to tell other people about our extremely hilarious adventures, they all just stare at us as we burst into laughter. @CAPS2's possible that people don't think @CAPS2's funny because they weren't there.   This year my family has an exchange student named, @PERSON1. She is from @LOCATION2. She is very shy and quiet. @PERSON1 never seemed like the type to make me laugh, @CAPS5 boy was I wrong. She is possibly the funniest thing to walk the @LOCATION4. I sure think she's funny, anyway. Sometimes she is so oblivious that @CAPS2 is just hard not to laugh at her. I have a best friend named @PERSON2. We have so many fun memories together. She is amazing and funny. She is so short, people call her a midget, she is quick to reply, ""I am not a midget! I am @NUM1' @NUM2'', you have to be @NUM1' @NUM4'' to be a midget!"" @CAPS2 is so cute when she does this.  I recently moved back from living with my grandparents in @LOCATION1. While I was living there I had been informed (over the phone I might add) that there was a girl living in my old bedroom. ""@CAPS2's a foreign exchange student from @LOCATION2,"" my family told me. I flew back up to @LOCATION3 for @CAPS4 with my family. When I got here I met @PERSON1. She seemed so quiet and sweet. @CAPS2 was late when we got home so I immediately went to sleep. The next day I woke up, called my grandma, then called @PERSON2 and asked her to come over and hang out with me. She came and met @PERSON1. @PERSON1 told us she wanted to get my mom a birthday gift and I replied, ""@CAPS5, that's tomorrow, lets go into town."" All three of us went to town and went to @ORGANIZATION1 For @CAPS6. When we got there we all looked around for something we thought she might like. Somehow, we ended up in the underwear aisle. @PERSON2 picked out a tiny sized pair of underwear and shouted, ""@CAPS7 @PERSON1, what about these?"" @PERSON1 looked at her with the funniest facial expression and shouted back,""@CAPS8, I don't think my thighs would fit through that!"" @PERSON2 and I literally fell onto the floor and laughed so hard that our faces were bright red. Based on our first impression, we thought she was a quiet, ""keep to herself"" kind of girl so we just thought @CAPS2 was hilarious. We tease @PERSON1 about this quite often and she teases back about other funny things we've encountered. I've grown to love @PERSON1 and I love being with her and making fun out of all situations.

21238	8	" It seems like everyday of everyone's life they are being tested in every way shape and form and it seems like it will never end. It gets to be stressful and complicated but this is what makes us human. Something else that makes us human is laughter but no matter how bad things get to be it can always be changed by a knock knock joke, comic ad, or just one word from a best friend. Iv been with my dad and a couple of his high school buddies as they are telling stories about some of the crazy stuff they did when they were in high school. My dad and his friend @CAPS1 went off into a story about when they bought a @NUM1 @LOCATION1 tempest for @MONEY1. It turned out to be the greatest life lesson and some of the funniest stories in my life.  This was my dad's second car he ever had with a @NUM2 and a @NUM3 speed anything was possible. It started out when my dad first drove it to school which didn't last long, because an hour later. @CAPS1 and my dad left doing a burn out on speed bumps in the school parking lot. This car was a burn out animal backing up then side stepping the clutch to second and it would all be up in smoke. One day my dad was sliding around gravel corners and one of the rear bias ply tires blown out it thrown that car into the ditch and messed up the side pretty bad. Joe enders pulled him out and half a gallon of dera glass a hammer and a can of paint later it was ready to go again.  The next story I heard was when my dad's friend borrowed the car he needed something to get him back and forth to work. So my dad hands him the keys and says ""keep it on @NUM3 wheels"". Two weeks later on a weekend he was out messing around and the car slid off the road and rolled a few times and buckled the roof. I never heard how he got out but somehow he did and returned the car to my dad. After that it had an organ transplant of a roof from a @CAPS2 that hit a tree, @NUM5 weeks later and it's ready to go again. Now it's just something about a rear wheel drive car and snow that makes us kids again. sliding around in snow was the last thing this car ever did. My dad and @CAPS1 were driving in the snow having fun when the back end decided to trade places with the front. They lost control as they slid across the winter wonderland to a lonely telephone pole. The car slid into the pole and it was the end of fun. Finally the car had died and my dad had brought the car back home. He decided not to fix it and parted it out he sold the @NUM3 speed for @NUM7 @MONEY1 the engine for @NUM8 and the rear end for @NUM9 the trunk and hood weren't far behind for another @NUM9 the seat, steering column and radio my dad kept, the rest was scrap. So all in all my dad had some of the greatest moments of his life for no more than gas money and a few spare parts. God bless @LOCATION2 and I hope someday soon I can have memories like that.

21245	8	" What exactly is laughter? Is it when something virtuous happens and it makes a person joyful? According to @PERSON1's @CAPS1, laughter is a cause of merriment. In other words a light heart-ed fun spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships, but plays a big role in life itself. An example of laughter being important in relationships is, when a very good friend of mine stopped speaking to me over this empty-headed quarrel we had about some animal becoming instinct. It had been almost two years exactly, since her and I haven't spoken. I thought nothing would brings us together, until one day when I was at the store and we ran into each other. We just looked at one another and just started laughing. Right than and there we figured out that the argument we had was pointless, and not worth talking about. To be more clear with this story is that without laughter my friend and I would have never been reunited. When you meet new people what's the first thing you tend to do to get them to enjoy you? You usually tell jokes, or say something funny just to get a chuckle or two out of them. This is where laughter ties into life, physical and mental experiences that make up the existence of an individual. When you meet a new person you often see those individuals have at least one thing in common. I guarantee that in every single friendship laughter is the most common thing people share together. There is no possible way of getting around it. Another example of why laughter is important in life is when someone is looking for a job, or going to a job interview and the one who is in charge of making the decision of whether or not you get the job has no personality. What do you most often do in this type of situation, either show your serious side or possibly crack a few jokes. If this doesn't work well at least that person has a good idea about your personality. Learning how to handle life can become very stressful, also trying to handle it mentally can be quite a challenge. A friend of mine just graduated from college and she was struggling on trying to find a job that she studied in. She was very stressed out, and also very depressed because her grandma was in the hospital and ready to pass on. @CAPS3 didn't know what to do, no money was coming in yet, and she couldn't find an apartment she just was a mess. Until one day she told me that she revived a call from her sister and her sister mentioned that their grandma couldn't hold on and she was ready to pass. @CAPS3 rushed to the hospital and went to go see the last of her grandma before she passed. Her grandma grabbed her hand and told her, ""I know life can be mean and just give you no chances but you have to get through that and enjoy life. Life's to short to be worrying about what tomorrow will bring. Just put that smile on your face and laugh when life gives you the worst."" @CAPS2 and there @CAPS3 realized that what her grandma had said was true. You can't live through life in a drag, just have to get up and take it. @CAPS3 was very devastated about her grandmas lost, but @CAPS2 again she felt it was meant to happen because without her grandma telling her about this she wouldn't have never known that her grandma experienced the same thing as she did. She didn't feel like she was the only one in the world that was going through these difficult crisis. She will always love her grandma.  When you learn how to take life as it comes people tend to notice it is indeed a very hard step to achieve. Individuals learn in many other ways or some just don't learn at all. For example, @CAPS3 learned from experience going on with school and struggling with tying to find a job. Her grandma told her right before she passed on because her grandma probably most likely experienced it as well. Other people learn form meeting new people, and just having fun with life, or like me I learned the hard way by not talking to a very good friend of mine over a empty- headed argument. Laughter comes in different shapes and sizes, we as human beings have to approach it, whether it's an argument or learning it as it comes. One way or another it will come and we have to be ready for it, its not a scary thing. The benefits of laughter is it makes you happy and people tend to be having a good time. Laughter is a positive thing, and people shouldn't ignore it, its a good stress reliever as well. Laughter is a cause of merriment, a light heart-ed fun spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships but plays a big role in life itself."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21251	8	" Laughter has many benefits; happiness, joy, bonding with others,adreneline, the helping of releasing tension, and the joking that is made on a daily basis around you. Laughter is something that can be shared among people especially when they're in the dumps. This emotion is the one that will brighten up anyday and bring enjoyment. Laughter has been a huge part of my life. From family, friends, boyfriends, and stangers laughing has always been a big deal to me. I love being able to look at someone and see that they smile alot, which means that they probaly laugh alot and that they are a happy person. How can I tell this. Well for starters there is dimples in their cheeks and crows feet in the corner of their eyes. Really the crows feet don't matter about how old you are they can happen from laughing, smiling all the time, and squinting in the sun. The biggest part of laughter that has contributed to my life is having a relationship. Usually when you have laughter in the relationship it will make it last longer. The reason the relationships will last longer is because you can be yourself and let the other person see that you are fine with laughing and being part of their life. I believe that laughing in an relationship is the best part. Lets say your partner is in the dumps, are you just going to let them be moody all day or are you going to try to make them laugh and cheer them up. When I'm in a relationship and my partner is being moody I try my hardest to cheer them up. I love to make people laugh. And when I'm being a grouch my boyfriend is helpful and tries to make me feel better or they just comfort me to see what is wrong. So if there is not laughter in your relationship then obviously there will be no happiness. Therefore it will not work out between you and the person you're with. So spread the joyfullness of life and and make people happy. Another part that laughter that has been in my life is friends. If you don't know me well let me tell you I'm shy at first, but once I warm up to you, you'll see that I'm a very outgoing person. Like most of my friends will say is that I am weird, but I enjoy laughing alot and making others laugh too. When I'm around my friends and in the dumps someone will always in the end will get me to laugh. No matter how upset I am they can always get me to laugh at pretty much anything, since I am a really easy person to entertain. Being around these people is like watching a comedy movie or act. They are always finding some way to be funny and annoying. Such as being obnoxious and doing stupid things that others will never do because it's embarassing. Well just because it is embarassing doesn't mean you shouldn't at least do it. If you don't do it, it will give us more to do and give us all the attention to ourselves. How are you suppose to know whether or not it's funny if you don't want to try something new. How are you suppose to laugh at yourself and have others laugh with and at you no matter how stupid it is. So don't knock it until you try it. The person that once said, "" laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" is it true or false? Is this really the shortest distance or the longest? I honestly believe that is could be the a short distance. You don't want to be snooty or crabby all the time or you will never make friends or have any relationships. And if you don't have friends or any relationships then who will make you laugh and enjoy yourself. If you're not a happy person then how are you to experience the joys of life and everything around you. You won't, so put a smile on you face and be a spontaneous person who is not afraid. Laughter is a benefit to all man kind. And laughter in my life has showed me so much, it has brought me and others so much experience to enjoy. Those enjoyments that have been explored, are having boyfriends, friends, and family around me all the time. This is one emotion that is definitely one that will brighten up anyday and bring happy expressions to every ones faces. Share the laughter."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21262	8	" It all started one @DATE1 after school, when my girlfriend and I decided to make a plan to go to my house. We were not planning to walk home, we missed the bus. @CAPS6 we began to walk down the ramp from the high school. While we were walking we got hungry. @CAPS6 we went to the @ORGANIZATION1. We ordered a @CAPS1 and some drinks. @PERSON1 decided to shake up my soda @CAPS13 hand it to me. Me not knowing what's up @CAPS6 I asked, ""@CAPS2 you shake up my soda?"" @CAPS3 said, ""@CAPS4 I @CAPS2 here's mine, let's trade."" I @CAPS2 and ended up opening the one @CAPS3 shook for real. "" That was a lil devious!"" I said. @CAPS6 when I stood up to chase her and poor soda on her, I tripped and fell on some goat heads. While I was in pain, @PERSON1 was cracking up with laughter @CAPS13 said, ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 stupid, who falls over a stump!"" @CAPS6 I got up from the ground and pulled all of the thorns out, @CAPS13 continued to walk home. We were already more than half way to my house, when @PERSON1 decided to hit me in the shin and run. Of course not learning my lesson the first time, I chased her. I chased her for about a block and a half. Basically to my yard before I slid on mud, and @CAPS13 fell in a puddle of water. I thought I was going to loose it when @PERSON1 was laughing too dramaticly. Out of @CAPS14 were, I jumped up and was going to put her face in it. @CAPS3 ended up running inside my house, and locking the door. The reason I knew @CAPS3 @CAPS2 lock it, was because I ran @CAPS6 fast to bust in. before I @CAPS2 I turned the knob, but it didn't open though. Instead the impact forced me to fly back, and land on poop. The bad part was that it was fresh, why, well because my back was warm in a certain spot. I quickly took off my shirt and threw it away, @CAPS13 headed inside to shower. @PERSON1 asked me why I was going to shower, but I decided to lie to her. @CAPS12 I told her what really happen, @CAPS13 @CAPS3 will laugh and make fun of me. After I was done showering I asked @PERSON1, ""@CAPS7 you want to go shoot some glass bottles in the back?"" @CAPS3 replied, ""@CAPS9 I'm down let's go!"" @CAPS6 I set up six bottles and was ready to shoot. First @PERSON1 tried and hit four out of six. That's pretty good for being a girl. @CAPS6 I went to replace the four bottle @CAPS3 shot. As I was doing @CAPS6 @CAPS3 shot me in the butt.""@CAPS11!"" I yelled and wanted to cry, but I didn't. The only thing I @CAPS2 was swore like @CAPS14 other, and aimed my gun to @PERSON1 to get her back. @CAPS3 was quick to run upstairs and grab my @NUM1. @CAPS3 said with a freaked out voice, ""@CAPS12 you come any closer I'll throw this out the window!"" @CAPS13 I said to her, ""@CAPS14 you won't, you know how much I paid for that!"" @CAPS15 my luck shot her in the leg. Well turns out @CAPS3 wasn't lieing bout throwing it out the window. It was ok though, because I could get another one. That @DATE1 with @PERSON1 was great, but @CAPS3 laughed at me most of the time. I didn't care, whatever makes her happy. I really @CAPS7 like making her smile. I delt with a lot of pain that day, and lost a shirt with poop. It's all good though, it's going to be a great memory when we look back on this day. "	18	20	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3

My dad hasnt every really cursed around me before, i guess that's time away for you. It was pretty funny all these stories he was telling me, @DATE1 the way he was explaing them. That brought pretty happy laughter to us both. @DATE1 really brought us back together again."	17	19		36				4	3	4	4	4	3	4	3	4	4	4	4						
21266	8	" This is the second time I have been to @ORGANIZATION1 and I can't wait to go on all the rides. The lines are extremely long but I am with some family that I haven't seen for a while so we talk and catch up. My uncle who is there with us tends to play tricks on the kids and embarrass me. He has given me wedgies, put his kids diapers under my pillow, and many more crazy tricks. I knew this trip would be no different so I tried to stay clear of any plans he had in mind. @CAPS1 was going to be a rather warm day today so I put on some basketball shorts and a t-shirt. We headed out with five kids under the age of @NUM1 so I knew we would be going on some smaller rides. After we went on ""@CAPS1's a small @ORGANIZATION1"", we decided @CAPS1 was time to go to the bigger rides but we would need some lunch first. We went to a burger shop and were waiting to get our food, so me and my uncle decided to have a spit ball war. We were shooting across the isle from table to table trying to dodge people walking by. I hit him twice in the side of the cheek so he told me I had won.  Once we ate our food and went outside to leave he told me, ""@CAPS2 see who can hold your little brother above their head for the longest"". I not thinking about @CAPS1 said, ""That's easy!"" and lifted my brother up. Little did I know that was a big mistake. He walked over and pants-ed me in the middle of the walk way. I stood there with a kid above my head and my pant's at my ankles. People sitting down at tables stared and laughed as they saw all this happen. I was so embarrassed, how could I be so stupid to fall for his trick. I couldn't believe I had fallen for @CAPS1 again. @CAPS1 happened so fast and I didn't know what to do other then chuckle inside. After that we decided to head to space mountain to get some fast passes. They allowed for you to not have to wait in line and go to the front, but they could only be used for certain times. We had to wait for about twenty minutes and @CAPS1 was raining. So we put on our blue @ORGANIZATION2 ponchos and the kids were playing tag. My brothers were the loud crazy kids that always have energy and don't stop running. They would keep coming up behind me and hitting me in the back and running away. After about the fifth time I couldn't take @CAPS1 anymore so I told them if they hit me again, they were going to get hit back. After about two minutes I got hit in the back again so I turned around and walked up to a kid in a blue poncho and hit him on the back of the head. Little did I know I had just hit a random little kid in the back of the head. I felt horrible as the kid looked up at me with a blank stare wondering what had just happened. I was so embarrassed that I ran and hid behind a tree as my my uncle and parents were apologizing for what I had done. Although my family was embarrassed for what I had done they were laughing hysterically inside at the same time. I had no idea that the kid wasn't my brother and could only imagine what that kid was feeling like."	19	19		38				4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4						
21269	8	"  Middle school was a challenging environment. Not only are kids subjected to a rapid advancement in the academic environment, but a maturing social environment as well. The rapidly growing need for social dominance and in turn inflating egos makes for a bully breeding ground. Without the skill to be able to laugh it off, I would fear for anyone's mental well being in that environment.  Throughout my first @NUM1 years in middle school, I struggled with the building social discomfort of classmates higher in the social chain, making for a severe toll @CAPS1 not only my self-esteem, but my academics as well. The stress of my own social stature plummeted my grades continuing a cycle resulting in even more stress. The whole situation seemed hopeless and depressing. I could not believe that in only a little over a decade of life, my outlook had become so grim. I wondered how I would make it through the rest my school years.  Everyday I had the pleasure of hearing any number of new insults made up by those higher in the social ladder, attempting to supplement their growing self-esteem and inflating egos; @CAPS1 some days even those who I previously believed to be my friends joined in with them. Except for a few trusted companions, it seemed the whole world was out to further themselves by bashing me with any number of new insults.  Being made fun of daily had continued until I realized something; That laughter is key in social survival. Without laughter there was no way I could have survived those school years. After this revelation I was able to laugh at things said to me and laugh at myself as well. I was able to take the the cacophony and learn with it, taking it as critique to better myself. Through laughter and their jarring remarks I was able to secure my position in the social scheme as well as improve my intelligence, as well as make new, better friends and come to peace with others, while maintaining the the hurt I experienced earlier to be ""popular"" without having to make fun out of those who were like who I used to be; @CAPS2 a win-win scenario.  Laughter is key in any situation, whether it be a conversation with a friend, or experiencing the penned up frustrations of immature adolescents. From laughter I learned a great lesson, one that I hope everyone has not learned should. Without the lesson of laughter, I don't know how anyone could lead a successful and pleasurable life.

21272	8	" I have heard people say that a smile makes a big difference in a first meeting, a relationship, or just walking past people on the street. If someone has had a bad @CAPS2, not only should a smile make it better, but also some laughter along to accompany that sincere smile. I enjoy walking down the street on a nice, beautiful @CAPS2 and walking by locals I know that smile, laugh, and give a little wave to show that they are enjoying the @CAPS2 as much as I am. Walking past someone I @MONTH1 not know also has its positives. One look to see their face can tell me if they are having a good @CAPS2 or a bad @CAPS2. Either way, I give a smile. A smile to show that it is a good @CAPS2 or a smile of encouragement to let them know it will get better. I enjoy the feeling I get @CAPS12 I meet someone and I know that we connected great. A good first impression is very important for me because it can determine how the friendship will go and how long it can last. I now know that I enjoy being around someone like me who enjoys to smile and laugh. I can't really seem to see myself around a serious person and I know if I was, we would clash and have problems because I am loud and if they are serious, there would be problems and not be able to collaborate on decisions.  @CAPS12 I first met my friend @CAPS1, I was nervous and scared because we were set up as a blind date by a mutual friend. It was a @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS2 double date with our friend and my cousin. @CAPS12 the guys first picked us, I got into the car and the first thing that I remember was seeing a big smile on this guy's face. I ended up getting more nervous and began to stutter as we started to talk. As the date went on, he seemed like a down to earth guy and always seemed to have a smile on his face and laughter seemed to flow right out of him. As time went on, we became closer than what I would have ever thought of. I was not sure where our friendship would lead us, but soon after, it became noticeable that he liked me and I liked him. We took it slow, not rushing into things. We had long conversations that would last us hours at a time and we always seemed to laugh about everything. He made everything seem better and better each and every time we talked. Pretty much having the same personality and both always smiling and laughing helped us connect right away.  Just the other night , @CAPS1 and @CAPS4, our mutual friend, came over to visit my cousin @PERSON1 and me at her house. We were all laughing and enjoying each others company @CAPS12 @CAPS4 and @PERSON1 decided to go to the store and buy some things using @CAPS1's car. Since they weren't going to be gone for long, @CAPS1 and I decided to wait inside. Minutes after that, as we sat, talking to each other, @CAPS4 and @PERSON1 run into the house looking flushed, out of breath, scared and nervous about something. @CAPS4 wouldn't look at us, so @PERSON1 told us to go outside, something had happened to the car. As we stood there, I realized that the car was no where in sight in the driveway, so I became suspicious. We asked them where the car was and they pointed to the road and in the dark all we could see was the faint outline of a car in the ditch. I was expecting @CAPS1 to get mad and say something to @CAPS4, who seemed to not know what to say, but instead he smiled, walked towards the car and said, ""@CAPS11't worry, the car is fine."" @CAPS12 he said that, he started laughing, his amazing laugh. I was still in the state of shock and so @CAPS12 I heard that laugh of his, I turned and looked at him, and realizing that he was happy and didn't seem to mind the accident, I began laughing as well and in less than @NUM1 seconds of him beginning to laugh, not only was it us four laughing, but also two of my other cousins that had joined us outside. Laughter made the situation better and I enjoyed the fact that we could all laugh about the smallest, the unexpected and the worst as well as the best. What also made me happy, was the fact that that very same night after the incident, @CAPS1 asked me the question I was hoping to hear and the way he said it made me laugh which then caused him to laugh. I answered his question with a hug and a yes and he brought out a banquet of roses. As we walked inside, my cousins and my aunt started to applaud and we all started to laugh with smiles on our faces."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21276	8	" ""@PERSON1, @CAPS1 up! It's almost time you to go to school!""  @CAPS2 mom yelled at fuzzy hair, half-opened eyes, and yawing boy. That's me. Today is a first day of @CAPS2 first new middle school. Our family moved to a new place, that's why I had to move a school too. I woke up and took a shower and wore @CAPS2 school uniforms with exciting and nervous mind, because I didn't know anyone from @CAPS6 new school. When I arrived to the school, students who are same age as me started to scream out loud for sadness of school days that are coming up or excitement of meeting their friends again. On the other hand, I was depressed and confused because of these hyper students and the new school. I shook @CAPS2 head off and started to concentrate finding @CAPS2 classroom. '@CAPS3 hah! There it is.' @CAPS4, I found @CAPS2 classroom and when I stepped in, @CAPS5 looked at me curiously for a while, since I was the ""new"" kid to @CAPS6 school. I sat alone and waited for teacher to come. During I was waiting, I put @CAPS2 head down and slept a little bit with no smile on @CAPS2 face. Suddenly, teacher opened the door and spoke loudly, ""@CAPS5 sit down and be quiet!"" @CAPS6 teacher must be the most strict teacher I've never seen. While teacher was writing down something on the whiteboard, the students were trash-talking about the first sight of the teacher. It was terrible for yelling at the student when you saw for the first time. For example, I knew a kid who went to a private school and transferred to a public school. I had a same class with him and I was his partner. Since I didn't know him very well, I started to ask questions about him. At first, he answered back nicely to me and I thought, 'We could be close friends from @CAPS6 class.' @CAPS7 it was wrong. He started to talk loud to me when teacher was explaining something to us and it got me into trouble for talking with him. Other students hated him for being distracted during class and he often asked useless questions to the teacher really loudly. Also, he had weirdest perfume smell that he thought it was cool to wear. @CAPS5 thought he was annoying which caused to a small fight. @CAPS8 arguing with other friends, he stopped coming school and now we don't even know where he is at. Like @CAPS6, it shows that the first sight is really important to have in relationships with other people. When I heard that the first sight is really important from other students who were sitting behind me, it changed @CAPS2 mind to an open mind such as having a smile on @CAPS2 face. I though, ' I shouldn't be like that kind of teacher's first sight. Maybe I should change @CAPS2 face looking with smiling and some confidence on it.' @CAPS8 that class, I started to put smile on @CAPS2 face and thought positively. I tried to be participate for the class and worked hard for making new friends in the new school. Therefore, the other student opened their mind as well and started to ask things about me. For example, it was like these questions; 'why did you come to @CAPS6 school?', 'what sports do you like most?', 'what game do you play?', and etc. From those aggressive questions, laughter can change @CAPS2 looking and make good relationships. How did I know? When I first entered to @CAPS2 classroom with concerning face on it, @CAPS5 just stared at me and looked like they didn't want to know about me. @CAPS8 putting laughter on @CAPS2 face, they started to feel comfortable than the first time. Changing me depressed face was @CAPS2 starting point in the new school. I started to make a lot of friends which it became a way for me to be a class leader. I felt really amazing and awesome that how ""the new guy"" can be the leader of @CAPS6 class. I felt proud of myself and thought of happiness that I actually started to have laughter on @CAPS2 face since the teacher didn't look good without a laughter."	17	17		34				4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	3	3	3						
21277	8	"You know how people say that school is the most fun place to be during the day? Well i would have to be agree to that because when I'm at school I would laugh all day long when i see my friend name @PERSON1. We would have fun all day long just the three of us in the same classes but two classes but we still be laughing in the halls and in the class rooms some times at each other and people that we don't know. I always loved coming to school last year but this year is not that much fun because @PERSON1 moved into the @CAPS1-es and I don't know where she lives now but after @PERSON1 left the good old days was fun with her it sucks that we are not going to the same schools with her or her still coming to school with us now it is just the two of us @LOCATION1 and my self we hardly have some fun in class without her but most of the days we do.   I remember when @PERSON1 first came to this school she look like the other girls in our class but once we got to know her we became best friends. the next day she though that we would not like her because is a new kid at the school and that stuff we got to know her all to well because we would hang out with etcher teacher back from the seventh grade we would hang out. The thing that i always love about @PERSON1 is that she would turn anyone whom is having a bad day and turn it into a really good day for you she would always do things like that but there are some days when she is felling down and blue and @PERSON2 and me would try to make her feel but she would just get mad at us because we wasn't there for her when she needed us. I felt so bad after that but we are friends and friends so post to be there no matter what. The next day she wouldn't remember what was going on yesterday because she wouldn't remember that much when she is really mad at someone. one time in one of my classes we was not doing much in that class because there was not that much people in there we were painting and me and @PERSON1 was painting bulletin board. the colors was white and brown we kinda of got it all over the place and each other i panted her hand haft brown and the other side white and she got some of it on the paper that we was using to let it dry up so we can paint again but that did not work out so good because we had to go yo our next class. The next day we was in that class we almost the same thing but we kinda of got it on the grand, sink, sops descender, and each other we draw a little something on each other i draw a heart that has her name in it her name was in pen and the heart was in paint. In our next class we was laughing the rest of the day we even got my sister @LOCATION1 to laugh with us even through it was not that funny because we ate a lot of candy and candy makes us laughter all the time. these days are the days that I'll remember all the time because @PERSON1, @LOCATION1, and I are always laughing all that time because we always find something to laugh about and talk about. Out of all the times that i laugh the most fun ones are with my friend @PERSON1 because we would have lots of fun when we are with her she is the glue that was holding us together. I think when all of us are together we are always laughing every scent of the day. No matter what we did or didn't do we would laugh all that time. This one we would say ""like"" all the time in one of our classes that we would have all that time during fifth because we was the only two girls in there with four boys and a guy teacher so @PERSON1 and me would do almost anything in that class because we would not do anything that would get us in troble."	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	3						
21287	8	"Laughter is the shortest distance between two peopleFor the longest time I never thought that I could be happy. I felt as if every time I tried, someone was always there to say ""@CAPS1 no, she's about to be happy. Better take everything away from her."" That's @CAPS2 always happened; I was the one being dumped, cheated on, or losing a best friend. I would lie awake at night sometimes and wish that maybe someday someone out there would listen and care and understand. I didn't think that wish would come true, but somehow it did. @PERSON2 was the type of guy you could tell anything to. He would listen and care as if it was his problem also. That's @CAPS2 attracted me most to him. His sense of knowing when things weren't right and attempting to make them better. The thing I loved most about him was how he could make me happy when I felt so down. He didn't live close to me, he never came over and we barely knew each other but he made me smile better then anyone I've know for years. I guess I never believed laughter is the shortest distance between two people. It didn't take long for that to be proven wrong.Freshman year and I was lost. I just wanted to be popular, make friends and get a good boyfriend. My main focus that drove me through each class period was boys. It wasn't the best thing I could have focused on but hey, they got me through. I still remember sitting in my math class when a tall boy with brown-blond hair sat in the front row. @PERSON2 was his name, and I suddenly became attached. I did @CAPS2 most girls do when they see a cute guy. Made a fool of myself. I was so sure that I was never going to get a chance with him until I got his number. The story goes on from there, we dated and dumped. For a while we didn't talk. But that's @CAPS2 made us bond even more. We later became best friends, and that is how I became happy.My boyfriend, was not a good boyfriend at all. It took me a while to realize this because I was entranced on his ability to make me feel important. I assumed I wasn't important when I called @PERSON2, crying the night he cheated on me. Usually when you ask a boy to help you with your problems, they don't know @CAPS2 to say. But when I talked to @PERSON2 he seemed as if he was going through the same thing. His perspective on the dilemma helped me get through it. I talked to him for the longest time that night, explaining how I felt. To my surprise, he actually cared and listened. After hours upon hours of talking, @PERSON2 and I finally realized that we have to be related in someway. Him and I have so much in common. We have both been through the same scenarios and we both help each other get past it. One time after a dance @PERSON2 called me saying, ""I cried, when @PERSON1 left tonight."" I helped him. Then later that month, he thought she was cheating on him. I helped him. I remember calling him one night and he woke up just to hear me tell him I quit the dance team. People tell me not to get too attached to him, but I cant help it. We don't even have to be in the same room and he makes me smile. All the things we have been through make me laugh. He makes me laugh. He isn't the class clown or the comedian, but its just something in the way he can be himself and not get embarrassed that's @CAPS2 makes him so fun to be around. We @MONTH1 fight and not get along sometimes but I know he will always be there when I need him.Sometimes I sit and think back to the beginning of the year. When I was timid, quiet and unhappy. I think of how @PERSON2 is the most caring guy but you wouldn't notice it unless you got to know him. I think, ""@CAPS2 if I never met @PERSON2"" and I wonder if I would be the same person I am today. I now recognize that I have changed so much over these few months. Maybe its from @PERSON2, or maybe its just myself. But I'm pretty sure laughter has something to do with it. It brought me and @PERSON2 together in the beginning and it keeps us together even now. From being total strangers and now best friends. Maybe it is true; laughter is the shortest distance between two people."	20	20	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
21291	8	" My friend @ORGANIZATION2 received a random phone call in the @TIME1. It was his friends from high school there were three of them. The weird thing about that is they haven't talked much since high school. Surprised @ORGANIZATION2 asked what was going on and how they were doing: assuming they were in jail or something in that matter. Instead the friends replied and told him how they was doing and then told @ORGANIZATION2 they wanted to go on a road trip. @ORGANIZATION2 thought to himself ""why the heck are you telling me about this"", and then said cool. what do you need from me? The friend replied saying he needed @ORGANIZATION2 to plan the trip because they did not have computers and they couldn't read maps. at the end of the phone call @ORGANIZATION2 finally said he would help and plan the trip out. Then asked the friend were he would want to go for this trip, The friend replied I don't know i wanna see a professional baseball game and were ever @ORGANIZATION1 land is i would love to go there. A week and a half went by later @ORGANIZATION2 called his friends back to tell them the plans. Proudly he said after his hard work of planning for them. its a ten day trip for you guys starting in @LOCATION1 then driving down to @LOCATION2's @ORGANIZATION1 and on the way down and back hit up (watch) a game from all five of the professional baseball teams down in @LOCATION2, then go to six flags another amusement park like @ORGANIZATION1. The friends replied what do you mean you guys? You are coming with us. @ORGANIZATION2 was super surprised and told them :you guys haven't talked to me in about five years and then you randomly want to go on a road trip with me he said sounding kind of confused. The friends replied well we need your car and we don't know how to drive and again we don't know how to read maps. Thinking hard about the situation @ORGANIZATION2 finally caved in and told them yes but then gave conditions. He split up tasks for his friends so he wouldn't be stuck with all of the work.For example he gave one of the guys the task of finding hotels and places to stay, another was finding gas stations, and the other friend had to find all the restaurants they were going to eat at.  The trip had started and for @ORGANIZATION2 the vacation was much needed and unexpectedly fun and relaxing. At lest for now. Everything was going through and working according to plan they hit up and joyfully watched four of the five baseball games and had a great time, then @ORGANIZATION1 land went above and beyond expectation, and even six flags was exiting and brought @ORGANIZATION2 and his friends back to feeling like they were in the good old high school days.The only slight bit of worry for trouble was one of the friends became behind on his task of finding hotels and places to stay for everyone. the friend had the nights were they stayed at a relatives or friends lived mostly setup. but for the hotels they were kind of last minuet. Last few days before heading back plans were still going accordingly.They just had one more event. the giants baseball game, then stay with there old high school buddy who moved down to @LOCATION2. making sure they would have a place to stay for sure @ORGANIZATION2 asked the friend in charge of finding places to stay. The friend replayed with a""no i haven't talked to him yet. i will call him later.""this made @ORGANIZATION2 a little uneasy, so he told his friend no call him now.the friend did.There other friend picked up to bring bad news he was back in @LOCATION1. @ORGANIZATION2 thought to him self I knew this trip was to good to be true. On the @TIME1 of the baseball game things felt rushed. @ORGANIZATION2 and his friends had to leave really early because the traffic in @LOCATION2 is so random and bad. Mean while @ORGANIZATION2 for got to use the restroom and two hours into the trip to the giants game things started to take a bad turn. @ORGANIZATION2 had to go bad. But his friends kept him going saying the traffic is good we need to keep going. which @ORGANIZATION2 listened and kept going. Then traffic came to a stand still. @ORGANIZATION2 was going to go in his pants!so he pulled off and drove down the side of the high way surprised he didn't get pulled over he miraculously ended up at giants stadium then he saw a portable potty he pulled over and raced to it,it was locked. @ORGANIZATION2 looked around and saw another one. he takes off as fast as he could for it. And yes it was open finally @ORGANIZATION2 thought to him self ecstatically! he stepped inside but then looking at the urinal he realizes he didn't get there fast enough and embarrassingly he went in his pants."	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21294	8	"@ORGANIZATION1 you think of a relationship, what do you think of? Do you think laughter is a big element in a relationship? Laughter meaning laughing sounds indicating merriment or derision. Many people have been in a relationship before from excellent to bad they knew @ORGANIZATION1 laughing with each other they enjoyed the enjoyment from one another. First of all @ORGANIZATION1 a couple is laughing they enjoy being together therefore it makes them want to spend more time with one another. Laughing by it's self let's the couple have a better beyond with each other. The couple would obtained a better connection to. Thus they would be able to understand each other. for example @ORGANIZATION1 a couple is just out having a excellent time they would want to keep sharing the wonderful beyond with each other. Another reason laughter is a element of a relationship it will end up letting the couple have a stronger relationship because thy would have a marvelous connection with each other therefore they would be able to understand each other. Therefore things between them would succeed in a stronger and better relationship. Next time you are in a relationship think about how laughter,is a element and how enjoyment, connection, more time with each other and stronger relationship all some how benefits just from laughter. So the next time you are laughing with your boyfriend or girlfriend think about what you guys are benefiting from just laughing with one another."	17	13	34	34				4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	2	4	4	4	4	3	3
21306	8	"Don't speak, laugh. I love @CAPS11 little brother. We're @NUM1 years apart in age @CAPS7 from the way we act, @CAPS3'd think we were twins. @CAPS7 @CAPS5 matter how close we are, we still are siblings, and we still fight. Usually they're just petty little fights that we get over in a matter of seconds, @CAPS7 this one was one @CAPS4 could not back down from. I beat him at @CAPS1 tennis. @CAPS14 was a warm afternoon, and me and @CAPS11 brother had just gotten back from school. We usually relax for a little before we do our homework by challenging each other at playing @CAPS1.  ""@CAPS3 cheated."" @CAPS4 said firmly. ""@CAPS5 I didn't!"" I snapped back. I could tell that @CAPS4 was getting really upset about this, @CAPS7 I didn't care. I wasn't going to let him win this one. ""@CAPS6 yes @CAPS3 did. @CAPS3 always do! @CAPS14's not fair."" ""@CAPS7 I didn't this time."" @CAPS4 was telling the truth. There are times when I cheat by distracting him during a game, @CAPS7 I won fair and square. ""@CAPS3're just mad because @CAPS3 lost. Get over yourself and take @CAPS14 like a man."" That's all I had to say to make him throw down his controller and make him run upstairs crying. ""@CAPS6! What did @CAPS3 do to your brother?"" @CAPS11 mom yelled. ""@CAPS4 beat him at a game and now @CAPS4's mad."" I knew @CAPS4 would do that. @CAPS17 and report me to @CAPS11 mom hoping that she would save him and get me in trouble. ""@CAPS13 @CAPS14's just a game. @CAPS3 can't win every time."" ""@CAPS14's just not fair!"" @CAPS4 said before slamming the door of his room. Sweet, sweet victory. I love when I win. @CAPS14 makes me feel superior. @CAPS7 of course that little feeling of guilt of making your little brother cry came over me, so I went to @CAPS17 and apologize. ""@CAPS13?"" I knocked on his door. ""I'm sorry for making @CAPS3 cry. @CAPS14's just a game though. @CAPS3 win some and @CAPS3 lose some. Don't be mad."" I gave the most heart-felt apology I could think of at the moment. ""@CAPS17 away. I don't want to talk to @CAPS3."" @CAPS17 away?! I walked all the way upstairs to tell him I was sorry for something that I didn't even need to say sorry for, and @CAPS4 tells me to @CAPS17 away? Oh @CAPS5. @CAPS5. @CAPS5. @CAPS5. After processing what had just happened all that could come out of @CAPS11 mouth was, ""@CAPS19."". And I walked off.  The rest of the day went on. We passed each other many times without even acknowledging one another. I couldn't believe that @CAPS4 was this upset about @CAPS14. @CAPS14 was probably one of the longest periods of times @CAPS4 didn't talk to me by choice. I started feeling really bad, even sad that @CAPS4 wasn't talking to me. I decided to try talking to him again. Only problem was, @CAPS4 was downstairs playing the @CAPS1 again and I was upstairs this time. I came out of @CAPS11 room and started to walking down the stairs. @CAPS4 could hear me coming, so @CAPS4 turned down the volume of the @CAPS21.  ""@CAPS13 listen. Are @CAPS3 really not going to talk to me over a game I-"" @CAPS23! All of a sudden, I was sliding down the stairs. ""@CAPS24!"" @CAPS4 was laughing at me! I landed at the bottom of the staircase and started to laugh too. We were both laughing! That's all we needed to start up conversation again. Just a little laugh."	20	26	46	46				4	4	4	4	4	4	6	5	6	5	5	5	4	4	5	4	5	5
21308	8	"During the @DATE1 I decided to join @ORGANIZATION2, I raised a market pig and was determined to sell it at the @LOCATION1. Raising a pig was time consuming and hard work. Without patience, great teachers, and having fun I wouldn't have been able to do it. That @DATE1 I had some great experiences and some of them, not so great. This was my first time being involved with @ORGANIZATION2, also my first time raising a pig. I never thought that I would have so many awkward moments. One of my awkward, yet funny moments happened when I was shoveling pig poop with my friend @ORGANIZATION1. This was also @ORGANIZATION1's first time being involved with @ORGANIZATION2 and raising a pig. @ORGANIZATION1 and I were just trying to hurry and get our work finished so that we could go back to our homes and shower. Turns out I was in to much of a hurry. My boots sank into the mud and poop which made me lose my balance, I tried using the shovel to catch my self but it was too late. I was covered in pig poop and mud from head to toe, I had fallen in it. @ORGANIZATION1 and I looked at each other for what seemed to be two minutes, but was only about six seconds, then we busted out in laughter. After our laughing was under control she helped me get up and we went to go find our agriculture teacher @PERSON1.  When @PERSON1 saw my once blue pants now brown, he couldn't help but laugh at me. He got his camera out and took some picture of me that are very embarrassing but make myself and others smile. After all the joking, laughing, and pictures were finished @PERSON1 gave some old clothes to wear for my ride home. I had to roll the window down because the car got pretty smelly. When I arrived home, I headed straight for the shower. This is an experience I will never forget. If I didn't have friends around me I don't think I would have thought of the experience as something positive and funny. Because @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 were there to help me and laugh with me, I got some pretty fun memories out of that @DATE1 raising a pig. Without the laughter it might of been a little negative, I might have been mad, or embarrassed, or sad. Laughter is an important element to have in a positive healthy lifestyle."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21333	8	" Isnt it funny how just a laugh can change a senery, a mood like someones face expression, and make a person laugh out of nowhere just because it is outrageous, or the laugh they hear sounded funny. I personaly have been through all of these stages of what I like to call, the contagious circle of laughs. In the past I have been cheered up by laughing, and hearing others laugh. At times even I have cheered others by makeing them laugh, or laughing at @CAPS3 own humourless jokes. It feel good to laugh, and at the end of @CAPS3 long lasting giggles I feel refreshed from useing all that energy just to make a noise. @CAPS3 friends pick me out to be the clown in our group. They all think im this hilarious joke popper ( I pop out all these funny jokes ) I personaly dont think im that funny, but for some reason just by makeing them laugh I laugh too. There is this one joke I made up all by myself to cheer up @CAPS3 friend @LOCATION2. It made everyone fall on the floor laughing. It is about walking through the store, and seeing the different nationalitys of mothers with there baby's. How each mother treats there baby's differently. At the end I tell how the african american mother yells at her baby to shut up. I use a cuss word but thats inappropriate for this writeing piece. You get the idea. Anyway @CAPS3 friends still to this day ask me to tell them that joke, and they always laugh just as loud as the first time I told them. There is always one person in your life that your totaly obbsesed about there laugh, only because you love the way it sounds. I personaly fell in love with @CAPS3 boyfreinds laugh, and that was why he looked so darn cute to me. The very first time we met he was picking on his cousin @CAPS1 in a park up in @LOCATION1. I was with @CAPS3 friend @PERSON1 in the trailer park where her dad lived at the time. Malikye ( @CAPS3 boyfriend ) had this laugh that made me want to scream ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!"", it was so funny. I wanted to run over to him and tickle him to death so he couldnt ever stop laughing. Most of the people that know him hate his laugh, and think it is obnoxious. He even hates his own laugh. I dont know why but I was addicted to it. It is funny how even hearing someones laugh can give you feelings for them. A laugh not only shows you sound, but shows you personality, and charecter. Laughing is a big importance in life. It shows so much about a person, and helps so many people. I love laughing. People should be full of laughter, because without it the world would be a dull and unhappy place. I dont know anyone who would want that. Evil @CAPS5 maybe, but he even has his evil laugh that shows his charecter...."	20	18	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3
21340	8	" There have been many times in my life in which laughter was the key ingredient. My family is always laughing. We could be laughing at a movie, or a joke someone just made. We even laugh when the jokes are aimed at us. The same thing can be said about me and my friends. My friends and I laugh at almost anything. I believe that laughter has been one of the most important pieces of my life, without it life would be almost meaningless. I can remember one @DATE2 when my friends and I decided to go camping at a lake for a week. We all packed up our tents, sleeping bags and other camping necessities. When we got to the lake it wasn't very crowded so we had no difficulty picking a camping spot. Once we finished unpacking our gear and setting up our tents we decided to go swimming. One of my friends shouted, ""I'll race you down to the lake!"" @CAPS1 took about five steps before @CAPS1 stepped in a small hole the perfect size for his foot to fit in and @CAPS1 fell flat on his face. Everyone started busting up laughing, it was like we couldn't stop. When my friend who had fallen finally got up @CAPS1 was laughing too. We spent the rest of the @DATE1 swimming and making fun of his fall, the best part about it was @CAPS1 joked around too.  That night we stayed up eating junk food hot dogs and smores till we almost burst then one by one we all passed out. over the next couple days we did pretty much the same things. We swam in the lake, took hikes in the woods, fished for a little while, and made fun of each other laughing almost the entire time. On the @DATE1 that we were there we all decided to wake up early and take one @DATE1 hike to the top of the nearest mountain. The trip to the top went smoothly and no one fell or got hurt. The only eventful thing that happened on the way up was that one of my friends dropped his water bottle and had to chase it halfway down the mountain. To us this was funny but not nearly as funny as what happened next. Before going down we all took a ""potty break"" as one of my friends called it, the only problem with this was that one of my friends decided to pee in what @CAPS1 thought was an empty hole. As it turned out the whole was not empty but home to hundreds of underground wasps. Unfortunately for us @CAPS1 didn't realize this until it was too late. Wasps began pouring out of there home searching for whoever was disturbing them, which happened to be us. My screamed in horror, ""@CAPS2 crap its a bees nest!"" The next thing I knew we were running as fast as we could down the mountain with seemingly thousands of wasps following us. The lucky ones had finished relieving themselves and ran away with ease, the unlucky ones were not quite finished and had yet to pull up their pants. Running with your pants around your ankles is not an easy thing to do just in case your wondering and two of my friends found this out the hard way. As they tried to run away they tripped over themselves and started to roll all @CAPS1 while they were being stung by the wasps.  We all made it down the mountain with very few injuries and not too many bee stings. I remember the first thing we did when we got back was laugh till we cried. Once we were out of danger this instance seemed like the funniest thing that had ever happened. My friends and I still bring up stories about our crazy camping trip and the run in with the cranky underground wasps to this @DATE1. I still think its one of the funniest things that will ever happen in my life and I am looking forward to the next crazy event. I believe that laughter has been one of the most important pieces of my life, without it life would be almost meaningless."	20	17		37				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3						
21342	8	" My alarm went on at @TIME1. It was another normal @DATE1 for all of my friends, but a big day for me. It was time to get up, eat breakfast, brush my teeth, put the last couple things in my suitcase, and head to the airport. For the @CAPS1 time I was going to fly on a plane across the ocean, and it was the last day with my family in @LOCATION3 for a whole year. The next time I'll wake up will be in a totally different place, country, and family, where I have never been before. It will be a new start for me and my life won't be the same anymore. I will be an exchange student on a high school in the @LOCATION1. After changing planes @NUM1 times and @NUM2 hours of traveling, I was finally at the airport in @LOCATION2, where my host parents were waiting for me with a big sign which said my name on it. I was very happy and excited that I finally arrived, but primarily I was really tired. We took off and headed ""home"". My new home was a little green house on a small ranch in the high desert of @LOCATION4, @NUM3 minutes out of town, and without public transportations. Due to the hot temperatures and the dry air I was very tired the @CAPS1 weeks. Adjusting myself took me about a month. Before school started, I visited my new high school and met the school principle. I also got my schedule and signed up for the soccer team, which had their @CAPS1 meeting the following @DATE2. It was good to see kids that will be on my school and in my classes.  Finally my @CAPS1 day of high school was coming up. It was exciting for me, but I couldn't hide that I was very nervous. After a one hour drive to the school I got off the school bus and walked into the building. It felt like thousands of people were in the hallway looking at me. I walked faster. I was hoping my @CAPS1 day would start out good. Finally, I reached my locker, and pulled out the little peace of paper with my locker combination on it out and tried to open it. Even though, I did it @NUM1 times my locker won't open.  ""@CAPS1 spin it @NUM1 times right, go to the @CAPS1 number, go left, pass the second number once..."", I was whispering to myself. The bell already rang, and thankfully a friend that I knew from soccer stopped by and asked me if I needed help. We both started laughing and I was so glad she helped me out or I would have been late to class on my @CAPS1 day. For the next couple times I needed her help again, until I figured out how to open my locker three days later.  Being open-minded, being friendly and smile are three things that are very important in life. Besides that another very important one for me is also to laugh about mistakes I make. More than anything else, coming to a new culture, land and meeting new people gave me a lot of experience for my life. Especially learning how to laugh about mistakes or situations to not get frustrated. Getting frustrated would have made my time harder and not as enjoyable. Laughing makes it easier for me to learn from mistakes I made and to move on. My mom once told me to be courageous to make mistakes, and I don't regret any mistake I made."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21346	8	" A @CAPS1 time ago when I was about @NUM1 years old. I had moved to @LOCATION1, after @NUM2 weeks went by @CAPS2 parents started going to church, while we was at church I meet some other kid who was about @CAPS2 age. I didn't know but I saw in his hand. @CAPS6 hasa deck of card. I noticed it right away that @CAPS6 liked to play yu-gi-oh which is a card game, which is very fun to play when I was @NUM1..., I wanted to ask him if @CAPS6 wanted to play the card game yu-gi-oh but I was too nervous to ask him, after church ended and @CAPS2 parents and I went home the day passed by. The next morning I had to get ready for @CAPS2 first day in school in @LOCATION1, it was kinda hard since I am going to be in that new school with no friends but once I got their I notice something right away i saw that same kid from yesterday I was kinda surprise since @CAPS6'd go to the same church as me. After @CAPS2 teacher told me to sit down I took a seat, @CAPS2 teacher begin roll call saying each students in are class name, each students replied and said ""here!"" when it came to that other kids turn his name was @PERSON1,once class started it went by kinda fast when you are busy doing class work so once lunch started I went to have lunch and surprisingly a lot of students in @CAPS2 class are nice to me they asked if I wanted to be their friends. I was happy since they asked but that one kid @PERSON1 didn't ask. So I thought @CAPS6 was mad at me later on after school before I gotten on the bus to go home I saw that @PERSON1 kid again so I ran to him and asked if @CAPS6 liked playing yu-gi-oh? @CAPS6 ""replied yea what bout you?"" I ""told em yea we should play yu-gi-oh sometimes"" @CAPS6 said we could play this @DATE1 at church. I told em @CAPS3. later on that day I told @CAPS2 older brother @CAPS4, I made some friends at are school, and this @DATE1 I'm going to play yu-gi-oh card with one of them named @PERSON1 who goes to are church, @CAPS2 brother @CAPS4 told me oh... @PERSON1 goes to are school? I said yea and @CAPS6 said I played yu-gi-oh card game with him last time at church. I was shock since @CAPS2 older brother knew @CAPS6 was and i didn't that time. I asked him why @CAPS6 didn't tell me @CAPS6 knew someone that play yu-gi-oh card, @CAPS6 said "" cause you didn't ask"" I was like... Oh..... Me and @CAPS2 brother started to laugh cause i didn't know @PERSON1 was @CAPS2 older brother friend and @CAPS6 laughed at me cause I never asked him if @CAPS6 knew anyone that played yu-gi-oh card game."	15	16		31				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	3	3						
21367	8	"@CAPS1 @CAPS2   @CAPS3 in to the school's office was a usual thing for me. I was only in elementary school and had already developed the habit of making myself "sick" so I could go home. It had worked several @CAPS2 but the reality was that some how adults could outsmart "my sickness". As a kid I was a perfect actor but apparently my acting skills were fading. All the staff new me by then and by now it was harder for me to make my ways out. I remember being in forth grade when I made an appearance at the office but not really by choice and in my innocence I never knew what could happen next. My cousin @PERSON2 and I were in the same classes, we used to look alike when we were kids and teachers would often confuse who we were because we looked like twins. One day my cousin was struggling with a couple math problems and @PERSON1, our math teacher decided to stay a few minutes after school to help her. However we also use to ride the same bus and I decided to wait for her in order to catch the bus together. Those few minutes became more and once @PERSON2 was out we had already missed the bus. That's when we made our appearance in the office and there she was the chunky old lady that new me by heart. I would always remember her sitting in a chair in front of the computer and filling out some papers.This time she knew it wasn't one of those "wanna go home" days. "We missed the bus" we said, she then asked us why, we both gave our explanations. In the meantime she called @PERSON1 to make sure we were telling the truth. When @PERSON1 showed up, the office lady explained what we had said, but the problem was that she confused our explanations thinking we both missed the bus for the same reason making me look like a liar. When @PERSON1 heard this she said that I wasn't telling the truth and when I tried to explain to her that the lady had been mistaken there was no use even my cousin tried to defend me but the office lady said she was sure of what I had said. Being a kid and all I felt ashamed even though I knew I was telling the truth. Mrs. @PERSON1 decided to give me a demerit but deep inside I knew I said the truth and that's what matters.   As a kid it seems like the end of the world in these situations. Feeling anger because I wasn't able to do anything about it but now that I look back it brings a smile to my face because in my poor judgment I could just think of the teacher as being mean but now I see that it was just a big misunderstanding. Now around @NUM1 years have passed and this memory is still with me but I only get the best of it. When I hang out with my cousin @PERSON2 the base of our conversations are these funny moments of our childhood that only bring laughter, just remembering the foolish things we did when we were young. Sharing these moments bring us closer not only as a family but as friends and there is no better thing than enjoying moments of long lasting laughter with the people we love."	19	20		39				5	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21384	8	" It was the @DATE1 and my friend @PERSON1 was going to come home with @CAPS2. We talked about our plans for the week all @DATE1 at @DATE1. Some of our ideas that we had thought up included going to a movie, hanging out at my house and doing our nails while telling stories, or going on an adventure around my neighborhood. At lunch that @DATE1 we decided on trying to do all of the ideas because we had @DATE1 days to hang out. After lunch we went to our next two classes and the classes seemed to go by really slow. Finally the @DATE1 bell of the @DATE1 rang and @PERSON1 and I ran to our locker to meet up and get all of our stuff to go home.  We went outside the front doors of the @DATE1 and waited on the front steps for my mom. We waited for twenty minutes @DATE1 we remembered that my mom told @CAPS2 that we would have to walk home after @DATE1 because she had to work late. @PERSON1 and I looked over at each other and started laughing, because we had totally forgotten about having to walk home. Finally we stopped laughing and got up to walk home. On our way home we had my i-pod out and the volume turned to max so we could listen to music and dance around. We finally made it home and dropped all of our stuff off and got something to drink.  On our way to my moms work, we stopped at the local gas station to get something to eat . We left the gas station and continued to my moms work. On the way to the bank where my mom works we came across a dog chasing a squirrel. The dog was running so fast that the fur on its face was pushed back and it looked like it was going to rip off. The squirrel ran up a tree that was nearby, but the dog didn't realize that he couldn't climb the trunk and ended up running head first into the tree. @PERSON1 and I started laughing at the dog because it stumbled around for a few minutes and then decided to sit down and just bark at he tree. We left the dog and squirrel and continued to the bank. We arrived at the bank twenty minutes later and talked to my mom. She gave us money to go buy a coffee and then she told us to go back home. On our way home we stopped at @ORGANIZATION2 and got coffee.   On our way back to my house from @ORGANIZATION2 we watched the people drive by and laughed at all the people singing in their cars while stopped at the light. We arrived back at my house and decided to put a movie in. We watched @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and ate popcorn. Any time the little yellow people came into the movie we laughed because we both thought they were cute. After the movie my parents got home, and we had pizza and @CAPS3. Pepper for dinner. After dinner we played the wii and then fell asleep. The next @DATE1 when we woke up my dad made us pancakes and eggs for breakfast. After breakfast we got ready to go and my mom took us to the mall. At the mall my mom told @PERSON1 and I to meet her back at food court around two. We left my mom and headed to the first store. While we were walking to one of the store we saw a guy with a mowhak and a green beard. We looked at each other and started laughing because his beard looked like a @CAPS4 tree tipped over. At @NUM1-o'clock we left to go back to food court to meet up with my mom. She bought us @ORGANIZATION1 and told us that if we left now we could go see a movie. We decided to stay for one more hour and then we left to go home. On our way home we danced around in the backseat and sang to all of the songs that we knew.  When we arrived home we played the wii until my dad got there. After my dad got home we ate dinner and then played the wii again. This time when we played the wii we got my parents to play too. Whenever it was my moms turn we would laugh because of how she would set herself up to bowl. After we finished playing the wii @PERSON1 and I went into my room and talked about all of the guys that we liked. We laughed at some of our choices because of the reasons that we liked them. We talked for about two hours and then fell asleep. The next @DATE1 we woke up and had eggs and toast for breakfast. After breakfast @PERSON1 got dressed to go home. After she left we talked over text about all the fun we had, and how we couldn't wait for tomorrow."	19	20	38	38				3	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	4	4	4
21388	8	"        Family trip @CAPS1 the @DATE1 my family and I decided to have a trip to @LOCATION2. My father, who had recently woken up from a comma, was in a state of depression. The doctor recommended that my mother should start planning family activities and do some over the @DATE1 break. I was twelve at the time, and noticed how my father was coping with the fact that he had both of lost his arms. He tried to hide the fact that it was too much for him to handle, but that only worried us more about his health. My mother, along with my sister @CAPS2 and I decided to go out on a trip -to distract my father- and hopefully get him out of his depression.  On the day of the trip we headed out at about @NUM1 am from the apartments. My mother was the type of person who would always be early for anything. Overnight we had packed our bags and already had the stuff in the car. Since we lived in the upper apartments, my mother and I helped my father -since there was no way for him to keep himself balanced- while going down the stairs. He didn't seem enthusiastic about the whole trip, but I made sure to get my sisters excited and they kept on talking with my father in the car. A few hours later, one by one my sisters started falling asleep then my father started sleeping. My mother was starting to get drowsy so I stayed up and started talking to her about random subjects. As I kept her company she began telling me stories about her childhood - the laughs she would get when her cousins pranked one another- and so on. Some of the stories were so funny we tried not to wake everyone up with our laughter. Even though she had lived a rough childhood, her cousin @PERSON2 was the one that had always known how to make her laugh.  My father and sisters woke up and started to get carsick, so my mother ended up exiting towards @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. As we began to look for a gas station we began to hear loud music, and as we got closer we noticed that there was a carnival in the middle of the city. My sister @CAPS2 who was @NUM2-years-old at the time began complaining along with @PERSON1 who was eight-years-old. I tried to convince my parents, and my mother agreed but my father only got mad. That was until my sister @CAPS4 who was @NUM3-years-old began on ranting on and on, until my father finally agreed.  My mother parked the car at the nearby park and my sisters ran ahead of us to the carnival. My mother tried to catch up with them while I locked the car from the inside. As we arrived to the carnival, we saw stands filled with jewelry, clothing, and other small items. We kept on walking and saw a group of gypsies dancing on stage. Later on a comedian went up and he made everyone laugh in the audience. After watching the gypsies and the comedian, we started to look around. We ended up buying three @CAPS5 parasols and the fourth parasol was free. We thanked the saleswoman as we opened our parasols for some shade. The @DATE1 heat was starting to get worse, so we headed towards the car.  As we reached the car, my mother's face turned pale, she had left the car keys inside. She began arguing with me, and I began regretting the whole trip. I was exhausted and didn't want to argue. My father finally interrupted by telling us that he was going to search for a wire hanger from one of the stands in the carnival. As he left with my sister @PERSON1, the rest of us began walking towards the park. @CAPS4 began pouting and my mother kept on blaming me for locking the car, meanwhile I pretended I was deaf. After my father came back with a wire hanger, I began straightening it out and bending one side to create a hook. After many tries I still couldn't open the car, and my arms began to hurt. An old couple riding on a motorcycle parked next to us and asked us what we were doing. My father told them we had left the keys inside car. The old man helped us open one of the car doors. We thanked him and said goodbye as we went inside the car.  We decided to head home, exhausted from the whole trip. Even though the destination had changed we enjoyed the trip, and everyone quickly forgot about the incident with the keys. My mother and sisters started joking around, and for the first time since coming out of the hospital my father began laughing."	20	18	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4

Everyone was going to @LOCATION2 for the biggest concert any one has ever been to. Only the students in eighth grade in either band, choir, jazz band, or jazz choir were able to go; if @CAPS16 didn't pay all your funds, then @CAPS16 were left behind. We were going to a hotel, attending a concert, and going to a @CAPS4 @CAPS5.   My friends, @PERSON3, @PERSON2, and @PERSON4 were without a doubt excited. We have never been on the longest road trip till then. @CAPS3 seemed to have taken days to get to @LOCATION2. We left at five in the morning with over one hundred kids packed into two buses. One bus was for the boys and one for the girls, yet there were more girls then boys so we split the boys bus.   I was stuck sitting with @CAPS6. @CAPS6 is a nice girl, but @CAPS3 was difficult to start conversations with her. @CAPS17 wanted to be back home in @LOCATION1. I never found out why @CAPS17 was so upset; which made my ride there unbelievably boring. Until @PERSON3's accident. @CAPS17 snorted a pretzel up her nose. Overall @CAPS17 was okay and everyone besides @CAPS6 laughed along with her.   By the third hour of sitting in a cramped bus, us girls had to go to the bathroom. Complaining to the bus driver @CAPS17 replied, ""We're almost to the pit stop. Just another hour or so."" The choir girls began singing about going to the bathroom. Soon the bus was filled with our melodious song and laughter. Finally @CAPS8, the bus driver, pulled over. A line of dancing girls bulged out of the bathroom laughing at each other.   Once we were done we said our farewells to the boys as they piled onto the bus and took off. ""@CAPS9 down. Lets get to @LOCATION2."" @CAPS8 said. We cheered as we drove off. Four hours later, we were stopped yet again, at another gas station eating our lunch. The boys were fine with how much progress we made; starting calling everyone of us girls the boys were getting annoying. Us girls ignored all calls from boys for the rest of our trip. Finally we got to our hotel.  At the hotel the boys got the top story while the girls got the lower story near the swimming pool. When dinner came along @PERSON1, our music director, aloud everyone to roam around the stores near by and buy our dinners. Luckily we were near @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, and a numerous amount of fast food places. @PERSON4 and I went to @ORGANIZATION1 while @PERSON3 and @PERSON2 got our drinks; since we didn't want @ORGANIZATION1 drinks they went to @ORGANIZATION3 to buy @CAPS11. We met back at our room with our goods. We gorged ourselves till our abdomens seemed to explode. Dancing her way into the bathroom, @PERSON3 apeard with a broom as her dancing partner. Our laughter filled the room. We partied on till we realized we had a concert to attend.   We had two hours till the concert and thirty dollars was missing. @PERSON3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4 and I searched our room almost missing breakfast and ending up empty handed. When we found the girls across the hall all except one of them were there. The remaining girls looked at each other. "" @CAPS6 was out of money yesterday and now all of the sudden @CAPS17 has money to buy food. We're missing fifty dollars."" @CAPS13 replied. @PERSON1 then came in, ""@CAPS14 up. We got a concert to attend."" @CAPS15 at each other with disapointment we all left.  Running to the back stage door I dropped my music. @PERSON2 laughed picking @CAPS3 up. ""@CAPS16'll do great."" @CAPS17 said smiling. I smiled back, ""@CAPS18 @CAPS16."" I turned and stepped out onto the empty stage and took my seat in the front of the band. Picking up my flute I began my solo. The soft chords filled my ears as I imagined myself alone. Although I was nervous my stage fright gracefully vanished.   I ran out the auditorium doors. Girls and boys laughing with me as we raced to the buses. The bus drivers hurried their way to the @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Once we were there, @PERSON1 payed for everyone and we were off. Laughing at ourselves @PERSON3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4 and I screamed at the top of our lungs when the @CAPS19 shock dropped. When the ride was over, we all laughed seeming to have come @CAPS2.  I didn't want to leave, but I knew I had to. Everyone piled back on the bus and called our parents to let them know we were coming home. Laughing at every mistake we made, @PERSON3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4 and I took a group picture to remember the trip. Some how amongst the trip we laughed together at everything.

If that's true, I should live forever! I believe laughing really is healthy for you.  I have a friend who's really sick right now, but when I'm with her I can make her laugh like crazy and it seems to make the pain go away. If I could cheer her up @NUM1 I'd be happy to do so. Yesterday her and I were together and I can't remember what we were talking about but it must of been good because she got me to laugh to hard that I threw up! I know that doesn't sound very fun, but even as I was coming up from doing that we were both still laughing. Times like that I can definitely look back and smile on. I love the effect laughter has on people. I've been sitting down at a bus stop and giggling or laughing for absolutely no reason and the people next to me will start laughing! That only makes me laugh harder then everyone's doing it! Also as long as you're with friends, or anyone for that matter, and you can laugh, that means you're having fun and enjoy each others company. I don't see the point in being friends with someone who can't at least make you giggle a bit.  The other day me and my friend were sitting in the car, it was dark, quiet and we were just talking. Out of no where my mom pops up saying, ""@CAPS1!"" (this always happens though.) @CAPS2 did we scream our lungs out. I guess we should have expected her to do something like that though. After we caught our breath, we both looked at each other only to start laughing hysterically at how silly that was.  Laughter really does bring people together, whether you're strangers or best friends. When you're laughing with someone you're usually laughing for the same reason, right? Just as my friend and I were in the car. That's what I love, because that means we have things in common."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21410	8	" When people think of football they think of the quarter back. When people think of basketball they think of the point guard. When people think of soccer they think of the goalie. Well when people think of softball they think of the pitcher. All these sports have one position where they are automatically put in a leader position. In softball the game always starts with the pitcher and usually ends with the pitcher. The pitcher is in every single play. Sometimes the pitcher pitches it and the big @NUM1 inch softball comes darting back at you before you even blink your eye and then the ball that you just threw underhand you now have to throw overhand to any of the four bases in a matter of seconds. To play a major position on a team and be a successful leader you need to be encouraging, helpful, and most importantly when the game is not going the way you want it to go, be able to stay calm and laugh and joke about the situation.I have been pitching fast pitch softball for ten years, and the compliment I get the most often is ""you have the best pitcher's mentality I have ever seen"". It is so stressful to be in a really competitive game and have the whole game on your shoulders. Three people on base, one bad pitch right down the middle and it is over the fence. One pitch can completely change the game! At times like these when the pitch just didn't go the way it was supposed to go and your whole time just looks at you with this gloomy expression on their face. As the leader on the team you can't just act defeated as you feel. I have observed numerous pitchers who just completely give up and look defeated. By being a leader, the other athletes look to you to see your reaction. If you look like you have no hope, then players assume that the game is over and the very next play they will mess up and so on and it will just get worse. By smiling and encouraging your teammates, they see that the leader hasn't given up and neither should they, this is always better in the long run. Players tend to look at who as the most authority on the field and respond the exact same way as they do.I play for a team that most of the players this is their second to third year. We are not a very good team but we practice hard and we never give up, it doesn't matter what the score is. In our league out of the seven other teams four are in the top ten in the entire state. One team in particular is @LOCATION1, they were first in state last year and were are very first game last year. By the third inning we were losing @NUM2. Even though I knew there was no possible way we were going to catch up, my goal was not to let them score again. In between innings I talked to every single player on my team, I tried cheesy jokes, inside jokes, anything to get rid of the tension. It worked and we played much better by having fun and being relaxed. Being in stressful situations people just have to find a way to laugh it off and see the bright side of any predicament and be able to get through it."	18	15		33				4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3

21416	8	"Many people believe that laughter is a key part of any relationship. There are many times when even the slightest laugh is needed to break the tension, or even just relieve some stress every once in a while. It is often said that laughter is the best medicine, and also the cheapest. Laughter is easily found and common to come by. In my case, laughter comes naturally to my sister and I and for no particular reason at all; it not only saved, but it built our relationship to what it is today.   When we were younger, my older sister and I did not get along very well at all. She would always tease me, then laugh about it; and I too would laugh at things that she did not find humorous in any way, shape, or form. This constantly caused conflict and many arguments between the two of us; therefore we hated each other and, in a sense, wanted nothing to do with each other.  As my sister and I grew older and wiser, we started to become much more alike. We still made fun of, teased, antagonized, and pulled childish pranks on each other; but instead of getting angry, we would just laugh about it instead. As we continued to make each other laugh, we found ourselves getting along so much better. Soon after that, we began hanging out more and more and just for the fun of it, not because our parents told us too. Before we knew it, my sister and I were best friends.  It is rare to hear about siblings being best friends. I am lucky to be able to say that my older sister is my best friend. Personally, I feel that laughter has played a huge roll in the relationship between my older sister and I. Now we depend on each other because we both know that no matter what, we can always make one another laugh and virtually cheer each other up. We hang out when we need to get away or when we have something that we need to get off our chests. We know we have each other for that because we know we can always laugh about it in the end."	20	19	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
21418	8	" Laughter is an interesting emotion. It's one that you expect to feel when you are happy or humorous. This, however, isn't always the case. Some people laugh when they're embarrassed or uncomfortable. Others, when they're enraged and upset. And then, there are people who laugh when they are grieving or sad. People don't expect that to happen. To laugh when you are depressed. It is strange but true. I know this from personal experience, which led up to one of the most tragic events of my short life.  I was about nine. The age @CAPS4 you're hyper and energetic almost nonstop. I had just arrived home from school and walked in the front door. My mom was waiting for @CAPS3 inside. ""@CAPS1 on @CAPS2,"" she said. ""We're going to see your grandparents for a few hours."" I was upset. I was not only tired and hungry, but I had to drive almost an hour away to see my grandparents. So I did what any nine year old would do. I cried, whined and pleaded her not to go. She didn't listen of course. She toned @CAPS3 out, waited until I was out of air, and then picked @CAPS3 up and tossed @CAPS3 in the car.  Isn't taking a nap great? That's exactly what I did on the ride over. I was clapped-out, so I felt it was alright to have a little ""@CAPS3"" time. When we got to their house, I had just woken up and didn't feel like moving. I had to force myself to get up and say hello. It was depressing, yet fascinating really. Seeing your grandparents is like seeing a glimpse of the future. In the sense that you know what your going to look like when you're old. They had candy though, which was tasty and mouth-watering. We actually stayed for quite a few hours. My mom called my dad a couple of times asking if we could go home, but we never did. She just had a conversation with my grandparents while I watched television. At last, my dad finally called to say we could @CAPS1 home. We said goodbye and booked it before it was too dark out. By the time we got home, it was pitch-black outside. We still hadn't eaten yet and I was starving. I jumped out of the car and walked over to the gate that separated the front yard from the back. I shook the gate, expecting three delighted dogs to run up and start jumping on the gate wanting to play. Instead, only two showed. ""@CAPS4's @CAPS5?"" I wondered. I thought he was most likely eating or sleeping so I decided to just go inside and eat. When I opened the door to the house, both of my parents were standing in the entry way. I could tell they were trying to hold back tears. Then it hit @CAPS3 like a ton of bricks. ""@CAPS5 passed away,"" my mom said. I froze. I didn't believe them. I couldn't. My best friend in the world was gone. I cried for hours, possibly more. I didn't know what to do. Then something weird happened. I started to laugh. I don't know why I did. Maybe it's because I wanted to try to cheer myself up. Or maybe, I realized he was in a better place. To this day I still feel an empty space in my heart @CAPS4 my best friend once was. I still think about why I laughed that day. I think about why we laugh in general. Whether it's when you're happy, angry, or even sad, we laugh to try to get by and make the best of both good and bad situations. As tragic as the situation was, I can't help but feel happy. My best friend was in pain and could barely walk, so we had to euthanize him. I knew it was the right thing to do, and quite frankly, I don't think I would have felt better if I hadn't laughed that night. It was awkward at first. It felt wrong and terrible, but it helped @CAPS3 more than I could have ever anticipated."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
21421	8	" Green is not my favorite colorLaughter is an indulging part of life that a variety of people @MONTH1 enjoy or @MONTH1 not enjoy. Humor happens to be infectious. The sound of roaring laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze. When laughter is shared upon one another, it binds people together and increases happiness and intimacy. Having to pick out one of the million laughter memories I have had was nearly impossible for me to decide, because every moment I spend opening my mouth and bursting out my ""ha-ha-ha"" with joy and excitement. I try to indulge the person I spent it with and the exact memory that happened.  It was the @DATE1, @CAPS1 for many of us @DATE1 is one of the most enthusiastic times of our twelve months in the year. I was going to be hosting a pool party with all of my friends, @CAPS12 I needed to clean it out because it happened to be awfully disgusting from all the year long seasons that the weather decided to bring down. I didn't think it would be that much of a deal because that was the only way I would be able to host my party with my parents permission. @CAPS1 if you know me well enough, I am the average typical teenage girl that probably texts more than @NUM1 texts a day. So since I can't keep my white, somewhat sweaty hands off my phone you @MONTH1 already have a feeling of what happens next. If you taught I dropped it. Your absolutely wrong. Not surprisingly after cleaning out my pool for about one hour I finally finished, @CAPS2 I texted my boyfriend telling him that my pool was no longer green anymore. He replied with "".......?"" I questioned myself if I had sent the wrong message to the wrong person so I checked my history and it turns out that I had wrote to him, "" @CAPS3 my poop is no longer green anymore."" I was literally mortified. I didn't know what emotion to feel or what to expect from him later that day. I decided to just pretend it didn't happen anymore. So later that day my pool party started. Everyone showed up and looked at me in a weird way then usual @CAPS12 I was to ecstatic and pumped to my favorite song by my favorite singer @NUM2. As everyone showed up they all had a present bag in there hand, I wondered to myself why they brought presents if it wasn't anybody's birthday it was just a casual pool party to welcome everyone's favorite season, @DATE1. So I asked the question to my best friend and she told me, ""@CAPS4 we know its nobody's birthday @CAPS12 @CAPS5 texted all of us telling us you had green poop, and you were not feeling well so we went to @CAPS6 to buy you @CAPS7-@CAPS8, and @CAPS9 @CAPS10 ."" I was petrified and to be honest actually laughing insanely hard. So I stood up in front of all my guest and told them what had really happened and we all laughed historically. Without exception we kept the party going, and I eventually saw my boyfriend coming. I walked up to him and all we did was laugh with compassion and didn't mention one word about what had happened.   Once the party was over and it became dawn we decided to have a bonfire and get cozy with our loved one, and just all us friends bond with one another. You can guess what happened next, we began to talk about what had happened earlier and I can honestly say I don't think I have laughed that hard in my fifteen years alive. Rapidly our curfew had almost expired for the day, so all my friends left and they made a nickname for me, ""@CAPS11."" @CAPS12 the funniest part about this story that I will never forget is, that when all my friends left, my boyfriend decided to take me out and get a burger at our local, also known as the best hamburgers in our town. As we finished eating a mother came along with her baby boy. I had to take a few seconds out of my life to carry it, and make my dummy looking face in order to make it jiggle a bit. @CAPS12 little did I know that the baby had just eaten. So you can imagine what happens next, green vomit gets all over me. I was honestly not mad, nor embarrassed. I just laughed so hard that I could feel my abs working out and tears from my eyes coming out. I believe in each and everyone of our lives we all have a special moment we desire to worship forever. It @MONTH1 be sad, embarrassing or even a comical quality type of moment we indulge in our memory. So till this day I am still known as ""@CAPS11"" to my friends, and there is no doubt that I will ever forget this memory."	18	23		41				4	4	4	4	4	3	5	5	5	5	5	4						
21441	8	" An argument is defined as ""A discussion in which disagreement is expressed."" In many cases, a proverbial ""@CAPS1"" is created between the two conflicting parties. Without a way to bridge this gap, the two groups, or individuals, will not come to a settlement, and continue arguing until one or the other backs down and accepts the others point of view. Laughter, can serve as this bridge. The door slammed shut and I went straight to my room. I had returned home from what had started out as a good time with one of my oldest friends. Looking back I do not remember what it was about, all I knew was that I was not going to speak to him ever again; but being as young as I was, these such thoughts rarely last. I would see him every day during the school week, but it would not matter whether he was there or not. He was absent to me as long as we fought. This seemed like a good plan, to completely ignore each other until we had calmed down, but as with any plan, things never go quite as well as you want them to, especially when you are in the same elementary school, and in the same class.  In elementary school, or at least in my case, there were many group activities, and when you are paired with the person whom you are not on the best terms with, things become difficult. Whether it was to build something, write together, or solve a math problem as a group, communication and teamwork are both important, and us fighting did not effect the group well. We would each discuss the best way to go about performing the task at hand with another member of the group with whom we were not fighting with, and then they would discuss and consult each of us separately. In short, it was a mess, and much more difficult than it should have been. Outside the classroom, the fighting persisted. At recess we would not agree to be on the same team, or even be on the same side of the field as one another. After about a week of this, I realized this needed to stop. At recess, I tried to get him to talk out our problem instead of shouting at, or ignoring each other. The calm resolution to the problem started out well, but being children, ended in a shouting match, to which I lost. I began to wonder if we would ever resolve this. When I got home that day, my mother, being a mother and always knowing when something is wrong, asked me what was bothering me. I was resistant at first to explain things, but, being a mother, she talked me into telling her. She started to go on about how I needed to be the mature one and that we needed to calmly talk out our differences, which I had already tried. I began to tune her out and imagined my friends mother giving him the exact same speech. By the time she was done, all I had received from the lecture was that I needed to try again. The next day at recess, I searched for him with the intent of resolving things today, no matter the circumstances. When I found him and attempted to talk things out, it once again turned into a shouting match. Nearby friends started to crowd and we kept at it. Suddenly, in the midst of the yelling, my friend, with whom I had been fighting with for the last few weeks began laughing. I was taken aback and thought about what could possibly have happened for angry shouting to turn into laughter. Looking around I saw nothing out of the ordinary, only a few snickering bystanders. I ran what had just occurred back through my mind. Just as I reached the point where he started laughing I had realized I had inadvertently made a joke while we were yelling at each other. This realization caused me to laugh, and everyone else nearby to laugh. After we stopped laughing, we sat down and talked things out like we should have done from the start. We questioned why we were still fighting over something as unimportant and trivial as this. After about five minutes of talking, we agreed to still be friends and that we would try to talk things out in the future before shouting at each other. When a teacher blew a whistle and recess had ended, I walked back to class feeling happy, and relieved that we had finally worked things out and could continue being friends. If I had not made that joke in the middle of our fight, I am not sure if we would have made up, even in the event we realized how pointless it was. Laughing during an argument will not solve your problems for you. However, laughter can create a bridge across the @CAPS1, and provide a common ground in which problems @MONTH1 be solved."	18	23		41				4	4	4	4	4	3	5	5	5	5	5	4						
21448	8	 A time when laughter was one element or part was when my brother showed a youtube video to my family. The video was about a guy who was talking about his childhood when his dad told him to go to the store to get bread to make sandwiches for dinner and was told to not to get into any trouble. To avoid getting into trouble his dad told him to go across the street because there was three boys down the block that looked like trouble. So he did what his dad told him to do and he went across the street but when he was passing the boys they stopped him. One of the boys yelled out something and a bunch of their friends came flying from a that was barbershop across the street and surrounded him. He managed to get free and ran as fast as he could. He said that he was running so fast that he knew that he passed a @ORGANIZATION1 because he said he was behind it and then was in front of the car running to get to his house. When he got to his house he told his dad that he did what he told. The dad was only worried about is if he got the bread and the guy was upset that his dad was worried about bread instead of him. The way the guy told his childhood memory was funny and even though I was already shown the video by brother the night before we both still thought it was funny and so did my family and we would burst out laughing at times.	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
21483	8	" My grandfather always used to say, ""life is like a kaleidoscope, you can keep turning and turning and it @MONTH1 seem like it is changing, @CAPS1 really it's just repeating itself."" @CAPS1 i have always wondered if the statement really applies to life, and if it does why would we want life to continue in the same pattern, if it isn't going like we had planned.  When i was twelve me and my two little sisters were split up and three thousand miles were crammed in between us. i was put here in @LOCATION2 while they remained in @LOCATION1, where i was born. At first the pain of those three thousand miles was devastating. it was like i had two of my essential organs removed from my body. Eventually though time passed and the agony lessened @CAPS2 grip on our lives. It @MONTH1 seem cruel @CAPS1 most of the time now the thought of them doesn't cross my mind. maybe @CAPS2 true what they say, ""out of sight, out of mind.""  @CAPS2 sad to think of how close my sisters and I were before the change. we did everything together. we are very close in age, the youngest and I are only @NUM1 years apart. i remember all the times we would spend outside on humid @DATE1 days. We would look as white as ghosts because of all the sunscreen my mother would generously apply to our skin. Times were different then, they were happy, i was happy. If i think really hard I can see us sitting on the shag carpet in my room, playing with dolls until the sunlight melted slowly into darkness. If only i could have that moment again even for a second, then maybe i could feel that happy content feeling once again.   Although much time has passed since our separation i still have those days when i feel that my world is caving in around me because they are so far away. I'll give them a call and the questions are always uncomfortable at first, like between strangers meeting for the first time. i can feel the three thousand mile scab on my heart reopen and it bleeds as though i am leaving all over again. I ask myself why do i bother to call if it hurts this bad? And then i hear it, like the beautiful sound of classical music to my ears, I hear them laugh. I have that feeling i needed all of a sudden, i am happy. With every small giggle my smile grows because i know i have made them feel whole again and for a second i have let them forget about for far i really am. Their laughter makes those three thousand miles evaporate into the air. In those moments of laughter i know that we are close again that we are sisters, not strangers. It's true what my grandfather says, because no matter how my life changes i will always have that feeling of total bliss when i hear the sweet laughs of my little sisters."	20	21		41				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	4	4						
21495	8	"     Every one laughs, i love to laugh in fact that's one of my favorite things to do. If your in a bad mood or just cant get happy, laugh at things cause i am sure it will lighten up your mood and i will tell you what, its also very good for you in many ways. If people didn't laugh then this world world would be a very depressing, you smile at someone who isn't the happiest could totally change their mood. So as i have told you before i am a very happy and energetic person and laughing is what i do best,and i smile at everyone around me. well i have a story for you, i like to volunteer at homeless shelters and old folks home cause i believe i should share my happiness with everyone else around me it makes my soul feel good to help people out. This one after noon i was doing what i do best laughing and having a good time at the old folks home making people smile, they all love having me around cause they say i cheer them up. I run around room to room bringing in vases of flowers opening their curtains to let the beautiful sunshine in, i always told them vitamin @CAPS1 is good to warm up the soul. There was this one man there who had never have a smile on his face and i did the same to him as i did to the other residents and no matter what i did he would never smile. When ever i came in he was always gazing out the window with a dead look on his face, so i had ask the nurses why he was so grumpy and quiet and they had told me he was a veteran. He didn't have much family from what i understood, or well at least they didn't visit him much they just dropped him off cause they didn't want to deal with the grumpiness any more. but i have a heart of gold and i feel like i should share. I had decided one day that i was going to turn that frown on his cute little face upside down, and make him feel happy and smile and interact with the other residents. So as usual i went in and did my daily routine to all the other rooms, we talked did some laughing and all sorts of stuff. I had saved the little old man for last i wasn't sure what his name was or what the what his whole background was like but i was going to go for it! I went in and he was staring out the window as usual, i hesitated for a minute cause i didn't know how he would react. So i went up and started talking to him, i introduced m self but he didn't seem to pleased. I asked him his name and he told me it was none of my business and that totally shot me down made me feel like i was the bad guy. So i started talking to him and asked him about his life, he had slowly opened up to and told me about all the stuff he had seen in the @LOCATION1 war. He turned out to be a nice guy, all those nurses were wrong about him they didn't even try. We laughed for hours me and him, and it didn't get old. Ever since i talked to him he has been progressively started interacting with the others, they just didn't give him the time of day to explain his feelings or someone to talk to. So think about it next time your going to the store and you see someone who doesn't look like they're having the best day, and shot them a smile!!! :)"	18	18		36				4	4	5	3	4	3	4	4	5	4	4	3						
21505	8	"  Laughter to me is the best medicine there is, and indeed a big role in any good relationship. It's especially good for a couple who's serious and has forgotten how to laugh. Also for those who could use their mood lifted. I know that laughter made my relationship so much better.  In the begginging my relationship with my boyfriend wasn't so great. We barely laughed with eachother, let alone spoke very much. Only with friends would we laugh and have a good time. Though we weren't much of jokers anyway. All we could do was get upset or just not say anything. Even if the joke was funny.  Well that all changed one night when we decided to go to the @LOCATION1 and play a few rounds of @CAPS1. When we got there we were kind of moody, and I was very short tempered. After we sat down the mood lightened a little. Then we finally got to talking and then one little outburst sent us practically rolling on the ground. We were cracking up. Faces red and gasping for air. We laughed so hard we almost cried, and the jokes didn't stop. Our moods totally changed once that happened. We couldn't even remember why we were upset. Almost like the anger just vanished.  Soon after we realized how rediculous we were and that it's alright to joke around, just so long as it's not mean. Later on we went to a friend's house and had an awsome time. We told a few good jokes, laughed an awful lot, and really had fun. Then when it got dark we decided to go home and were still cracking jokes. I don't know what it was about that night that but for the first time in a long time we were smiling and happy. Sharing that experience allowed us to really connect with eachother. Not only that, but it strenthened our bond, and brought us closer. Our relationship has been great ever since then. We can laugh and have a good time, without being so serious all the time. I know now why laughter is very important in a relationship.  Despite our little run in with moodiness, all that joking around reminded me that laughter is by far the best medicine there is. It did some things that others never could. Some @MONTH1 not think that laughing is best, but i believe it is. Those little giggles every now and then @MONTH1 not seem like much, but believe me there is so much more than you think. Laughter is everything to me. After what it did for me and my boyfriend, i don't know how i would live without it.    "	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21515	8	"      Well since you guys want to hear a funny story, I got a couple but I'm only going to tell you about one of them. This one starts in my @DATE1. I was living out in @LOCATION1 and it gets pretty hot in the @DATE1. I lived there a couple summers @CAPS1 I know how hot it gets. This @DATE1 I wanted to get a pool for the fun and to stay cool. But I didn't want a pool that just I could hangout in. I wanted to get a really nice pool for everyone. I already knew that those kind costed a bunch of money but, I wanted to get a big pool @CAPS1 I could have all my friends come over , hangout , swim and play my favorite game mar-co polo.I went to go talk to my dad about my pool idea. He said ""that he would love to get a pool for the @DATE1"" cause he would come in and swim with me and hangout but, like I was saying @CAPS2 are expensive and @NUM1 exactly what my dad said. I told him that I would pay for half of what ever it costed. My dad finally agreed with me @CAPS1 we go down to walmart and look at there pools. There was some cheap small ones and there was a lot of huge expensive ones but, I was looking for one right in the middle, not to small , and not to much money. I found one for eight hundred that was perfect for what I wanted. I went to go asked my dad if I could get this one. He said ""that if I pay for four hundred of it like the original deal that i could get it"". Like I told him @NUM1 what I said I was going to do and @NUM1 what i needed to do"". We finally came to an agreement that we had to get the money first , @CAPS1 I went back to my house in @LOCATION1 to make a plan to get four hundred dollars, my dad was doing the same, but he has a job @CAPS1 its not that hard for him cause he gets paid. @NUM4 a lot harder on me cause I have no job. @CAPS1 I decided to fix my bike and go looking around for any jobs available. I went door to door to find people that needed any help around there house. I found a couple of people who needed some stuff done and @CAPS2 both agreed to pay me fifty bucks, @CAPS1 out of each I could get a hundred right off the bat.I had to haul a bunch of old tree branches and garbage away. When I was done I put that money in my pool savings for later. I also went to this place called @ORGANIZATION1 and I was good friends with one of the kids that was related to them. I talked to him about him asking them if I could do any work for a little cash. @CAPS2 said that ""I could go to every tree and put a pink tag on him and @CAPS2 agreed to give me eighty five bucks. I took there deal but, my bike can't go threw the mud where the trees were planted. My friend said that ""I could barrow his little fifty dirt bike and take it to put those tags on the trees"". @CAPS1 I borrowed it and got that eighty five bucks. I gave my friend ten cause he let me borrow his dirt bike.I'm almost half way to my four hundred. When I was thinking, I got @CAPS1 caught up in buying this pool that I forgot my birthday was coming up tomorrow. I told my dad that I wanted that pool for my birthday and @NUM5 like ""yeah I already knew that @CAPS1 I already bought it"". I was @CAPS1 happy that I got my pool. Now I have like two hundred bucks to spend and I didn't know what to buy. @CAPS1 I bought a bunch of food and stuff for the pool party. On my birthday I invited a bunch of friends over to my house. We all got in the pool even the parents.We decided to play mar-co polo. Cause I wanted to play. My friend @PERSON1@NUM6 dad who is a huge dude was playing. I said mar-co and he lunged at me. I moved but he kept going, he went straight threw my pools wall and everyone fell out of the pool. i was laughing @CAPS1 hard but I was also upset cause my pool is already broken. Luckily @PERSON1@NUM6 dad is rich, @CAPS1 he bought me another pool. He seen how crushed I was on my birthday and because he knew I wanted that pool. He also bought me a new bike and it was sick. During the @DATE1 I had a blast in my pool and if I wasn't in my pool, I was on my new bike."	15	18	36	36				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	3	4	3	4	4	4	3	4	3
21516	8	"@CAPS4- @CAPS1 Laughter @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 I cannot imagine where my life would be right now with out laughter, who my friends would be, or @CAPS1 I would get through my day. Laughter is what created what has been one of the most important relationships in my life thus far. Laughter is what unifies us, it gives each of us something in common despite our differences. This has been proven true in my life, especially with one person, @CAPS4. I met @CAPS4 a year ago in a class of mine, we never really talked much or knew each other until that one day when she @CAPS2 me laugh. It was juts another day in class doing a lab when I see this short ginger hair girl twitching on a bar stole, I of course immediately begin to laugh. This girl was twitching around on a stole making awkward hand gestures and laughing, making me crack up, and not a single other person finds this funny, they are just giving us the "you girls are insane" stare. Others inquire what she is doing, @CAPS4 too hysterical to form actual words, I say "hello dudes she is a dinosaur like from @CAPS7 the @CAPS8, 'I have a bid head and little arms.... I don't think this plan was though out very well....'" @CAPS4 response with a point to me and a head shake, I knew this was the beginning a beautiful, laughter filled, @CAPS3.  There are countless times where laughter was been the center piece of my time with @CAPS4. When we are hanging out it seems that we effortlessly humor not only ourselves but others even the complete stranger. The best example I can give is when we were at @ORGANIZATION1, a hotel with an in door water park, for my birthday with two of our best friends. Our time there had already been full of laughs, pictures and a good time, but when we were all dressed up looking your something to do was the high light of the @TIME1. Two nights of no sleep, loads of sugar, and energy drinks @CAPS2 our little foursome more insane than usual, giving @CAPS4 the courage to saunter up to very attractive complete stranger and get him to say hello to the birthday girl, me. @CAPS4 and I start to bust a move and proceed to fall to the ground in laughter, at this point most people would think these @NUM1 girls are strange I am leaving now, but this guy was entertained by our laughter even he joined in on the laughter. Perhaps the best memory of @CAPS4's contagious laughter was when we went to see @CAPS1 to @CAPS14 your @CAPS15, believe me when I say this night could have easily down hill very quickly. Basically @CAPS4 was yelling at the movie, cracking, jokes, texting, making us laugh, so all the things that get you kicked out of a movie and make the people around you angry. But for some reason the people around us ate up her humor and found it hilarious, they were laughing along with us. It was one of the best nights at the movies I have ever had, I have never been on such an adventure. They way laughter has impacted my life is by giving me this amazing best friends who is crazy and humorous. @CAPS4 is one of those people who makes you realize that laughter is what unifies us and is something to do. So go ahead, act like your @NUM2 even if your @NUM3, you never know who you @MONTH1 make laugh and what friends you could make."	17	18		35				4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
21517	8	" My sister @PERSON3 and my niece @PERSON2 had just came down from @LOCATION2. It had been three years since I last seen them. When my brother @PERSON1, my sister @CAPS1, and I went over to my dads for the weekend we all decided we would go camping over by the beach. That morning we all woke up early and packed everything in the car. My dad and brother did most of the work while us girls got ready. After everything was packed we were off to @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is a small little town surrounded by mountains with absolutely nothing but a couple of houses, a park, a river, and forests all around you. My dad built a small one roomed cabin there a few summers back. It had a wood stove in one corner, bunk beds fulfilling almost half the cabin, and a counter that was always messy with all the food and supplies that we would bring. The whole ride over we were all messing with each other giving one another horse bits, the claw, and pulling on other peoples seat belts so that it would tighten across there chest. We were also telling @PERSON3 funny stories about one another trying to embarrass them. When we got on the gravel road my dad started making the car slide back and fourth scarring @CAPS1. While everyone else was laughing about it she was screaming. That @TIME1 we all decided to go to bed early so we could wake up and get ready to go to the beach before noon. @CAPS1 was the only one actually wanting to go to sleep. Everyone but @CAPS1 was trying to make fun out of the rest of the @TIME1. While everyone else was taking @CAPS1 was yelling at them to go to sleep and be quite. @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 started yelling random stuff just to make her mad. When everything was silent one of them would yell something like, its not to late to sleep like a baby @CAPS5 @CAPS6. @CAPS1 would start yelling while everyone else just busted up laughing. That @TIME1 was one of the funnest nights there. Everything was hilarious that @TIME1 but when look at it now it wasn't all that funny it was just stupid. I believe we made the most fun out of the @TIME1 as we possibly could. It has become one of my most vivid memories. We all look back at it and laugh."	16	16		32				3	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	4	3						
21521	8	"                                Coleslaw""@CAPS1's get out of here before they wake up @CAPS2."" @PERSON2 said, standing up with her blanket wrapped around her. I did the same, brushing grass of my pillow. Disappointment was rushing over me, I actually wanted to see the meteor shower. ""@CAPS3 coming @PERSON5?"" I asked, looking at my old friend in a new light.  ""@CAPS4!"" @CAPS14 said and gave me a look of pure anger.  All of us were supposed to be in bed at ten, it was @NUM1 am. It was week five at @CAPS5 @CAPS6. We had made new friends and met new people. @PERSON2 and I were @CAPS15 to help disabled children and @PERSON5 was @CAPS15 to hit on all of the cute guys the worked up @CAPS15 all @DATE1. As @PERSON2 and I walked @CAPS9 to @LOCATION1's camper to return her sleeping bags, I couldn't help @CAPS16 feel mad. That was the third time @PERSON5 had been rude to me @DATE2 and i didn't understand what her problem was. It could have been jealousy, @CAPS16 @PERSON5 didn't like @PERSON3. My mind was going a thousand miles a minute and I knew it was going to be a @TIME1. We reached @LOCATION1's trailer and opened the squeaky door. @CAPS15 @CAPS14 was, laying on the couch in her pajamas. Her daughter, @PERSON1, safely tucked away in bed. ""@CAPS7 girls!"" @CAPS14 exclaimed, ""@CAPS8's @PERSON5?""  ""@CAPS9 on the field watching the shower with her real friends"" I said, making air quotations with my fingers.  @PERSON2 rolled her eyes and re gripped her pillow and blankets. ""@CAPS10! @PERSON4, can we sleep in here tonight?""  ""@CAPS11!"" @PERSON4 said, ""@CAPS12 in and lock the door behind @CAPS3.""  We walked in to the trailer and locked the door. As we plopped down on the beds @PERSON4 made some chocolate milk. ""@CAPS13, ladies!"" @PERSON4 started out, handing us each a glass full to the brim with delicious milk, ""I want to know the good gossip! Why is everyone mad at @ORGANIZATION1?""  ""@CAPS14 is mad at me because your daughter likes me more."" @PERSON2 said, shrugging and taking a long draw of her drink. ""@CAPS15 is that."" I said, ""@CAPS16 the other part is a long story. So yesterday I was talking to her about @PERSON3. @CAPS3 know cute core-guy @PERSON3?"" they nodded, ""@CAPS17 I told her about a conversation @CAPS20 and I had @CAPS8 I told a @CAPS18 stupid joke and out of pity @CAPS20 laughed and said 'that's cool' I was @CAPS18 excited and @CAPS14 was laughing at me because i was jumping up and down.""  ""That doesn't sound mean."" @PERSON2 stated. ""@CAPS19! @CAPS14 then went on to tell me that @PERSON3 doesn't, and never will, like me. @CAPS14 said that @CAPS20 just thinks am stupid and feels sorry for me."" I was almost shouting, ""I mean out loud I agreed with her @CAPS16 in my head i was scream furiously @CAPS20 loves me! We are gonna get married someday!! I decoded his words with my heart!!"" I slammed my palm against my chest and pretended to cry. Then I couldn't help @CAPS16 laugh. All three of us were laughing hysterically at my faked passion. ""@CAPS3 should right skits for @CAPS22!"" @PERSON4 said, gasping between fits of laughter. Suddenly @PERSON2 stopped laughing and said, ""I @CAPS18 want some coleslaw! Random @CAPS23!""  ""I could go for some coleslaw right about now."" @PERSON4 shrugged. ""I could go for some @PERSON3-slaw right about now!"" I said, smiling. Instantly new laughter erupted from everyone. I thought about how much humor this story would lose every time i retold it in the future. Some how I knew that I couldn't do it the justice it deserved. The laughter started to settle. We sipped our milk quietly, thinking. As we did i looked out the window to see @PERSON5 walking our way from across the field. With a groan I got up to unlock the door. ""@CAPS24 it!"" @PERSON4 said, ""and turn off the light. Anyone who hate my @NUM2 year old daughter doesn't need to be here."" I flicked out the light and made my way @CAPS9 to the bed. @PERSON5 got to the door and tried the handle. When @CAPS14 found that it was locked @CAPS14 softly knocked on the door. Then @CAPS14 waited. We stuck our faces in pillows to muffle our uncontrollably laughing. Giving up, @CAPS14 walked away through the gravel. We all burst out laughing, unable to control ourselves. Looking at the clock, @PERSON4 gasped, it was @NUM2 in the morning and @CAPS5 would be starting in @NUM4 hours. It was time to get some sleep. @PERSON4 went @CAPS9 to her bed while @PERSON2 and I said our good-nights and rolled over. The trailer went quiet. Laying @CAPS15 I thought about the happiness created by us. I knew that @ORGANIZATION1 would be @CAPS25. @CAPS16 her being mad was worth what I learned. That @TIME1 I found out that if your happiness makes someone mad, that's @CAPS15 fault. Be happy and enjoy life! Anger is bred from the joy of others. So why not be @CAPS26? It beats the alternative, doesn't it?"	18	20		38				3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21535	8	" You know when you're talking to a friend and they tell a hilarious story about that one time @DATE1 when they spilt soda all over the person next to them at the neighborhood barbecue, or they tripped in front of an entire classroom full of people on the first day of school? And then you think its so funny that you laugh so hard you cry? I remember days like those, you always tend to feel better when you laugh. When friends hang out laughter is usually involved. To be able to joke around with someone and be able to laugh you usually need to be comfortable to be able to find something funny. Laughter brings people together even on the worst days.  Everyone has those awkward times when you're talking to someone who you aren't having the best of relationship with but yet you have to make due and try to make it less awkward. There's also the random joke when someones upset to try to lighten the mood. When you get someone to laugh its so much less awkward because then you know they are in a somewhat of a good mood and its easier to talk with less tension. I've had plenty of days when I've gotten into a fight with a friend and I've had to talk to them for class or they insisted on talking. It's just like they just keep talking or just listening to you and you don't know what they are thinking or if they are judging you as you speak. But you know they aren't when you can get them to laugh because then they aren't really thinking badly of you. It also helps the tension. There's also the time when one of your friends is crying over something which makes you want to cheer them up or let them talk to you. Sure there's still tension cause of the fact that they are crying but joking about it or trying to get them to smile or laugh does help distract them and get them in a better mood. It's said that ""Laughter is the shortest distant between two people."" and I think that's true because when you joke with someone you learn more about them and they are more comfortable to open up with you. Also if you can have a good laugh with someone they are more likely to become a friend of yours since you know how to make them laugh and it's fun to talk to you. The more you and a friend can joke and laugh together the more close you usually tend to get with them cause you enjoy spending time with them and you're more comfortable with them and you know them better. And also when you can joke freely with someone you can usually also talk freely to them about anything and you know they'll be there for you when you need a good joke or someone to talk to. I know that I personally love to hear funny stories, I never really have many of my own that I remember. I love hearing jokes and laughing with my friends. It always brightens your day to have a good laugh with someone you know. But most people tend to giggle or smile when uncomfortable too. You know those times when someones having an awkward conversation with you and they ask a question you don't want to answer or don't know how to answer and all you cam do is giggle and smile when they look at you expecting to answer. Or when you have to talk to someone you don't know and you just laugh and keep messing up your sentences cause you don't want to mess up. I don't know if laughing when you're uncomfortable is just a way to make it less awkward or because you're too confused on what else to do. Sometimes when you get awkward and laugh it can make it even more awkward when they just find it weird and sometimes it helps when they then joke with you or just keep the conversation going and make it less awkward.  Even when you know someone you can still have those awkward conversations or those moments of laughing so hard you cry. It is also said that's ""Laughter is the greatest medicine."" I also agree with that because when you laugh you always tend to be in a greater mood and when you're in a better mood you tend to feel better in any way and you also tend to be more positive about things. Laughter brings people together in awkward, sad, good, or just normal conversations. The better you can relate to someone, the more you guys can joke together, the more comfortable you are with that person. Your day is always brightened when you share a good laugh with a friend, a classmate, a parent, anyone, even a stranger. It always helps lighten your mood even on the most stressful depressing days."	20	15		35				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	3	3						
21536	8	" Have you ever had a memorable time, where you laughed so hard with friends or family? Well I know I have had several of those times with my friends and family. I love those times that you laugh so hard your stomach starts aching really bad.  First, one of my most recent memorable laughing moments I spent with my mom that I don't see often. So this moment meant a lot to me as you can imagine. The last time she came to see my older brother and I we went bowling. She brought her friend down with her as well. My brother and I hadn't bowled in a very long time, but we knew we would still beat them. It turns out my mom beat me though. We had a lot of great laughs over that, actually I think that was the first time I wasn't a sore loser. Although, I'm still not sure how she beat me, she would through the ball down the lane sideways and some how it would go right down the middle. When you have moments like these, that you can look back on to help you through the hard times, it's really inspirational. All in all we had some really great laughs that day that were shared with my mom.  Another memorable laughing moment was spent with my dad and brother. Every once in awhile my dad, brother and I sit in our living room and talk about several different things, some good and some bad. They can be about my mom, school, our animals or all three of our compassion for sports. These talks always mean a lot to me because we never spend much time together. We don't get to spend much time together because my brother and me are always at school or in some kind of sport and my dad is always at work. These conversations have several effects on me sometimes they are sad and other times they make me feel better about things. There are so many laughable moments just in our living room. One thing we always like to laugh about is the way my dad always says album. For some reason he thinks he has to add another @CAPS1 in front of the @CAPS2 so it spells alblum. My brother and I enjoy making fun of him for that but we all have our moments we like to laugh at each other for. That was just one of the many things we love to laugh about.  Sometimes laughter is a very important part in someones life. For someone who is on the edge, or upset, just saying something little to make them smile or laugh makes all the difference in the world. Laughter is a great way to make people feel loved and excepted, also a great way to put people back on track when they're down. I know smiles and laughing makes me feel so much better inside. I hope you have had some great laughing moments spent with the people you love and care about."	15	20		35				3	3	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21550	8	"Have @CAPS1 ever had that one friend who was your best friend, that @CAPS1 could go to for anything, that @CAPS1 were so close to that @CAPS1 guys knew everything about each other, from the way their nose flared when they laughed to their deepest darkest secret. Well @PERSON2 was that type of best friend to me. Us two crazy monkeys became friends in first grade. We were never the type of girls to sit down in class and read a book or stay calm all throughout school, no, we were the girls playing sports with the boys, getting dirty and scratched up. We always were laughing and playing and having a great time. Laughter was a big part of our friendship because,well, we were always laughing. We would get in trouble for keeping our parents up late at @TIME2 with our crazy jokes, loud laughing, and hyper psychotic ninja adventures we would take during the middle of the @TIME2. No matter what we were doing, we could always make a joke out of it all. "" @CAPS1 guys are perfect together"" said my mom one day, and all I had to say in reply to that was "" I know, we are two monkey ninjas.""  @PERSON2 and I had this one restaurant that we loved to go to, it was @PERSON1 @PERSON1. @CAPS2, @PERSON2 s @CAPS5 would take us to there at least twice a month and we would always get the same exact thing every single time. @PERSON2 and I could make some things funny that no one else understood. We would sit there in the booth with @CAPS2 and talk about the funny times, the stupid fights, and end up laughing uncontrollably throughout the time we were at @ORGANIZATION1. It was a warm @DATE1 @TIME1, @PERSON2 had come over to my house and was planning on spending the @TIME2. We had our whole @TIME2 planned out, we were going to call her @CAPS5 and talk him into taking us to @PERSON1, and when we got back home we were going to go on a jog, then get ready to go on an ""adventure"" is what we liked to call them. So we called @CAPS2 and had creatively talked him into taking us. But the catch was, was that we had to go over to @LOCATION1 s house mow the yard, plant some plants, weed some of the garden and then he would take us. So we went of course and did all the work that we agreed on doing, and we went to @ORGANIZATION1, dirty, sweaty, and exhausted. By this time everyone at @ORGANIZATION1 knew our names by heart. We made jokes with them and sometimes even got to go in the back room and get our ranch if there wasn't too many people there. We ate our food, got extra fries, extra ranch, and were sitting there with full bellies. We were all ready to leave, but @CAPS2 had to go to the bathroom. So @PERSON2 and I sat there and waited while he was in the restroom. He was taking a longer amount of time than he usually does, which was fine with us because we wanted to talk about this one boy that @PERSON2 was having a ""thing"" with, which we couldn't talk about while her @CAPS5 was around. Finally he comes out of the bathroom, and i notice his zipper is down but he is so close I didn't want to say anything to @PERSON2 about it until we were further away from him, and him being in his playful hyper mood wouldn't let us get far enough away from him so I could tell her. As we were walking out of the door, I finally told @PERSON2 to tell her @CAPS5 that his zipper was down. So as she turns and looks she bursts out into laughter because while his zipper is down he is talking to a group of people that work there. So as we are both laughing hysterically we are trying to tell him. We finally got him to start walking out of the door, and at that time @PERSON2 says between giggles "" @CAPS5 your zipper is down,"" he looks down and does his nervous/oh my goodness laugh and zips it up.  The whole ride home, @PERSON2 and I are busting a nut laughing as hard as we could. Our stomachs were about to explode because of laughing so hard. @CAPS2 was in the front seat occasionally giggling because he couldn't believe that his zipper was down the whole time. And as we were nearing my house he says "" there was a song playing, and I wanted to hurry and write the lyrics before they were over, I really liked that song ."" That to me, was the funniest thing @CAPS2 ever said. @CAPS2 went home and bought the song on i @CAPS7, and also learned to check his zipper more often. @PERSON2 is the perfect best friend for me, we are just a like in many ways. But our sense of humor is the most alike."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21564	8	" The surrounding area is dimly lit, accompanied by a fluorescent lamp shaded in the corner. Our blaring television screening an action packed, science fiction movie drowns out profane rap music escaping from my brothers headphones. Cuddled up on the couch my sister, @PERSON2, and I alternate braiding each others hair. Our small kittens @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON1 race to their food and water. As always @PERSON1 is superior and @ORGANIZATION2 scurries up the dining room chairs, defeated. Irritated @CAPS1 @CAPS2 sighs heavily with frustration once @ORGANIZATION2 trips his laptop charger and rips it out of the socket. Keys jingle, the door slams, speedy footsteps: @CAPS3's home!   By now it is @NUM1 o'clock and we have settled on the couch and everybody seat checks after snatching some food. The aroma of spicy @CAPS4 food steams the entire apartment as everybody feasts on chalupas and gulps down @ORGANIZATION1 from @LOCATION1. Napkins are distributed and the cats linger around our feet, waiting for their share. The last bite of my chalupa is portioned between the cats, which causes a bit of ruckus. @PERSON1 undertakes @ORGANIZATION2! The thief in @PERSON1's attitude begin to shine through as she robs @ORGANIZATION2's portion. This causes @ORGANIZATION2 to hiss at her, and proceed to hop onto the coffee table. On the way, she charges through the five drinks at the end of the table, managing to knock over two of them. Then the nacho cheese, being very unnoticeable, coats her striped gray paw leaving one-inch, yellow-orange circles to puzzle us. Minute but sharp white teeth are exposed and she devours the remains of @PERSON2's chalupa. Raining down the coffee table are trails of blue fizzy @ORGANIZATION1, and puddles gather at my feet the new suede couch. Smothered by booming laughter, @PERSON2 screams at @ORGANIZATION2 for stealing her chalupa. Following the escape of @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON1 trots innocently behind her. My sister is still steaming angrily so in attempt to calm her down, I take off my newly @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1-stained sock and catapult the mess toward her head. Instead of the sock slapping her in the face like I had hoped, it whistled past her ear and splashed in the fullness of my mothers stomach. Between the sock and the cats, the whole family is cracking up! @CAPS1 @CAPS2 reenacts the situation and his wild sound effects encourage our laughter even more. After a few minutes, the chuckles die down and we prepare ourselves for the next humorous incident.  I am freezing and muddy after a rainy softball practice, my siblings are just lounging around, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is frustrated from failure of employment, and @CAPS3 is weary and exhausted from a long day at work. We all look forward to what the night has in store for us: laying our busy brains on a fluffy pillow and allowing slumber to take over our life for the next @NUM1 hours. Looking past our sleepiness, we can still happily spend time with one another. Considering the fact that @PERSON1 is younger than @ORGANIZATION2, hilarious situations such as this, amuse my family daily. Surprisingly @ORGANIZATION2 wore the warrior suit this time which added a few extra minutes to the process of the hilarity. Not only that, by also the fact that it took a toll on everybody's dinner. My family is blessed with the knowledge of seeing light in odd situations. The main element in our memorable moments is laughter. Laughter is one of the few bonds our family will hold forever.

21571	8	"                                                The Laughter In @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are so many elements in a person's life that are important. Many are to make friends, be successful, but mostly to find happiness. Everyone wants happiness in their life right? The biggest form of happiness comes from your heart. Many believe that laughter comes from your heart and is believed to make you and others around you truly happy. One element to laughter being important in a relationship would be optimism to your partner and friends. This shows people that you aren't just a pessimistic, rude, unhappy person all the time. You can actually enjoy life and have a good time.After all no one wants to hang out with someone who is always negative and only looks at the bad things. Your partner will get sick of you and you will lose friends. Being able to laugh and joke around with people makes life a whole lot easier.It @MONTH1 not seem like much but it takes some stress off your shoulders if you have a good time and kick some giggle's. Another reason why laughter is so important in a relationship would be the sound of your laugh. What if you get a boyfriend our girlfriend and they had never heard your laugh before and once they heard your laugh they thought it was the most annoying thing in the world? Studies show they would be more than likely to leave you. On that note, if you do have a terribly annoying laugh and that is the reason you dont want to laugh, I would stick with smiling because us girls have pretty cute smiles that let us get away with alot. Lastly, @CAPS2 is one more main part of laughter being important in a relationship and that is happiness. You need to laugh to to be happy. Without laughter what is a smile? Without laughter how will happiness shine through? Lif e can get pretty boring when all you do is act like a mime. No smiling, no laughing, not fun! When you laugh, it helps others to laugh and have a good time. Plus, its fun! Like when you laugh so hard you cry or when you need to go to the bathroom really bad and it makes it worse when you start busting up laughing. Laughing makes memories. And memories are a very important part of growing up. So now that you have learned these three elements as to why or how laughing is important to anyones life, relationship or friendship, go out and laugh. It will make you feel a whole lot better. :)"	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21577	8	" Laughter is important in any relationship because it brings two people closer, connecting them between something they have in common forming an unbreakable bond between the two of them laughter is the glue that holds together any relationship and keeps a person from breaking into tears when something wrong happens. In fact without laughter I probably would not even get through my day to day school life. Without laughter one class in particular would be a nightmare.  In @ORGANIZATION1 we are dissecting cats and we are working with a partner, if I was not making jokes and laughing while I worked, my partner and I would have hated each other. We got to choose our partner and work at a lab station with another pair of students, fortunately for me I knew all of the people I was working near and with, and I was friends with all of them. we had to wear gloves and suits so we didn't get fluids or ""cat juices"" on us. First, we had to skin the cat, of course there is more than one way to do this, you can cut, slice, rip, and pull to remove the skin. Then we had to view and identify the muscles this was especially hard because we could not tell where one muscle begins and another ends. Next we had to remove the muscles and identify the bones and digestive organs. After we identified the bones and digestive organs, we had to remove them and view the stomach, liver, intestines, and kidneys. We had to cut open the stomach, intestines, and kidneys to look at the structure of them. lastly, we had to remove the heart and lungs. The class was told we are doing dissections for about a month and it has only been three weeks. You can only imagine how horrible and fascinating it is and how much I need laughter to keep myself together and from going insane. My friends keep me from breaking into tears and keep me laughing.  Dissecting cats in @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was challenging not only physically, but mentally challenging as well. It stressful, fascinating, and gross, and without the jokes and the laughter I do not think I would have never made it through it. My friends support there when I needed it guided me through the terrible assignment. So as you can clearly see, without laughter I would not be able to do some of the day to day things I do at school."	18	20	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
21578	8	" A couple years ago when I was in middle school I meet one of my bestfriend which who I have great times with. When I first meet her was in math class where she had an assigned seat next to me. We started talking and eventhough we did'nt know each other very well i could say laughter was the closest distance between me and her. We would just laugh at really random things that happened because we did'nt really know what to talk about. Sometimes it would'nt make sence of what we were laughing about. But we laughed any way eventhough we did'nt understand each others jokes.Laughing was something that keped our distance close. Time went by and we became good friends. Laughing was the one thing that keped us cose together because we had nothing better to do. We both are people that like to laugh a lot and if not we get bored. If me or her had no humor when we first meet I don't think we would of got along so well at the end. We did'nt really have anything to do because we did'nt know each other very good. We would only hang out during lunch and any other class we had together but all we did was laugh at what we thought was funny which was really dumb. We had nothing better to do.  A couple months latter we seemed to become really close friends and not just in laughter. We knew each other much better and finally had things to talk about and we found out we had something in common. Laughter still had something to do with our friendship but not as much as the begining of when we first meet. During math time we were always talking and laughing at the things we would say. That had never happened before. But now we were able to talk about other things too not just things that made us laugh and we new that laughter is'nt the only thing that is keeping us colse together. Now we had other ways to get along too. We both had friends that we could get along with differenlty. I had some friends with not a really close distance but we would laugh a lot. With some of my other friends I did'nt really laugh that much and we had a very close friendship. My friends and I can get along in different ways not just in laughter. We all have differents ways to get along and have fun. Some of them are really calm and some of them like to laugh a lot like me. Mostly all of the are just the type that like to be laughing all the time but we are closer because of the way we are with each other.  I think that laughing could be the shortest distance between two people. There are other things that can keep two people close together. Laughing does help people have a good time together but I don't think is a big, big part of a friendship. I think its how they get along and if the have somethings on common. It also depends on how they get along and how they treat each other. Everybody has a different way of what keeps them close to a friend so I think it's different for everybody."	16	16		32				3	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	3

I got ready for school after getting out of bed. When i got to school every thing seemed like our normal homecoming tell there was a announcement on the intercoms that had told every body out of no where there was a dance tonight. So after school was done me and my friends were going to head over to our house's to get dressed for the dance. After we were all dressed @PERSON1 picked us all up and we headed to the dance looking fly.  When we got there every body was looking dressed to dance except one guy, he was wearing corduroy pants with a red tucked in flannel and some brown worn out work boots. We look at him from head to toe and we thought to our self are we in a messed up hillbilly dream? That was just the beginning of what was yet to come. As every body started to get in grove of the beat we soon all started dancing to the music the music was good and every body was having a good time even the kid with the flannel. But just as every thing was going good a song came on that was called cotton eyed @CAPS1 when the flanneled kid heard this song he almost jumped out of his corduroy pants he soon stared kicking and swinging his feet and arms like if they had no bone or joints in them. Every body started to form a circular around the kid and every body was laughing and copying the kids movement even us. He didn't rely care he just kept dancing and singing to the song. The funnest thing about this was that the dance was a formal one and yet this kid manged to pull off wearing a flannel, some boots, and a pair ofcorduroy pants this kid was out of his mind in fact we still laugh and talk about it tell this day."	15	16		31				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	3

One prime example is on the @DATE1 me @PERSON1 three of my closest buddy's went hunting. That trip was the bast @PERSON1 worst hunting experience of my life. it was the worst because we shot @PERSON1 missed at two bears @PERSON1 one of the biggest bucks of my life. But it was the best because we all reached that tired state when every little thing was funny. The trip turned out to be a failure but the most important thing was that we had a blast, @CAPS1 teen age boys ridding around in a pick up truck making each other laugh. Another example was one @DATE1 this @DATE2 me @PERSON1 two boat loads of my friends went trip to a nearby fishing hole called @ORGANIZATION1@NUM1 is a small quiet @ORGANIZATION1 that not very many people go to, it is very peaceful. I brought out my fifteen foot duck/fishing boat @PERSON1 my ten foot canoe. I was controlling the big boat the only boat with a motor @PERSON1 towing behind us was the canoe. Inside the canoe was @PERSON1, two kids that don't mean to be funny but you cant help but to laugh at them. We were having a good @DATE1 of fishing @PERSON1 it was starting to wrap up. On our way back we stopped to fix a pole @PERSON1 the slack in the rope that was pulling the canoe became slack. When we started to move again the slacked tightened @PERSON1 the canoe lurched forward unbeknown to @PERSON1, who was standing up at the time. caused him to almost fall out. @PERSON1 when i mean almost i mean the only thing left in the boat was his feet @PERSON1 his hands which were holding on to the side rail. The only part that was in the water was his butt. This turned out to be the high light of the trip @PERSON1 we still bring it up from time to time.

Her skin was kissed by the sun and flawless in every way. Those lushes ruby red lips looed about as juicy and refreshing as the taste of a freshly picked pink lady apple. From the moment she sat down across from me i couldve sworn i was dreamin. How can any woman look so perfect and exist outside of a movie or game? Thats all i could think of, thats all i wanted to imagine. Just me and her together, but the thought of it was to great to come true I couldnt find a way to bridge this gap i felt between us. Neither of us had ever met or seen each other before and yet still i couldnt resist. it was like when adam was presented with the golden apple from eve. That smile, perfectly straight teeth with that sparkling shine that could blind anyone without sunglasses. Thats when she inally spoke and said ""@CAPS1 you know the answer to number three?"". I was stunned by her voice. It reminded me of a thousend violins played by angels. my mouth droped and all I could say was ""nope"". I was a complete mook nothing more then a hoser, but then i noticed she was wearing a cross to match her outfit. So I attempted to redeem myself with ""thats an amzing cross ur wearing, what kind of gem is that in the cnter?"". She smiled and batted her eyelashes and told me ""thank you, I like your cross too. mine has a ruby in it"". I smiled back then i got a text message from my friend wth a new joke he wanted me to hear. As I read it I started to burst out laughing. The angel in front of me was then curiouse to what I was laughing about. When i finally finished the joke she too bursted out laughing and I finally gave myself a proper intruduction and told her my name. She was smiling fom ear to ear after the laugh we sared and she told me her name was ""@CAPS2"". Ah @CAPS2 surly it had to be a name given to angels. To this day I still thank my friend who gave me that joke, because if I had not made her laugh then we probably wouldnt have gotten to know each other. If we had not gotten to know each other then she probably wouldnt be my girlfriend. To this day I still feel like the luckiest man in the world and if fate see's fit to split us apart then I will always remember that laughing is the best way to get to know someone."	17	18		35				4	3	4	5	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
21604	8	"Some say that laugh is the common language between people to people, nation to nation. If that is true, those laughters can speak all the languages around the world. In our lives, we all need laughters to be around. When they laugh, they don't just benefit themslves, but also all the people around them.There is a reslut from these people who study for phscology, they noticed that @CAPS1 don't cry because @CAPS1 are sad, @CAPS1 are sad because @CAPS1 cry. Same thing as laughing, @CAPS1 are happy because @CAPS1 laugh!I remember once, when I was in middle school, everyone in my class needed to go on the stage and do the presention. Before the presentation began, everyone was quiet, and there was nobody talking because we were all nervous. The classroom was dead quiet @CAPS1 could even hear a pen drop. I sat on my desk and did not know what to do. I was so neverous that I thought I would pass out in any second. I believed that was what my friends thought, too. Suddenly, we all heard a kid laughing! I did not know what he was laughing about, but the whole calss started to laugh! @CAPS1 could feel that the neverous situation was gone! Everyone started to talk and walk around. That helped me cliam myself down. I felt the big and heavy thing that was on my shoulder suddenly disappeared! The story was so unforgetable because I realized how aould a laughter change the situation from bad to good.Laugh could change the whole world from dangerous to peace. I am a laughter. I love to laugh because when I laugh, I feel everything is better. It could be both positive or negative, but laugh dose make my life better. People who are around me think that I am fun to be with because they could feel the joy I bring to them.Laugh is an important part of a relationship. My friend and I, when we get together, we always laugh about everything, from some random house to the sky. We really have fun together. There one time that I wondered, what is nobody in my group laugh when we are together? That would be no fun anymore! Without laughters, the distance between my friends and I would be a big gap, but with laughter, we would not have any distance between us! Then I noticed that the other group of people. Maybe they just had the bad day, they had no amile on their faces. When they sat together, nobody talked or laughed during the lunch time. They seemed they were not friends anymore. After dys, they started to talk again. They laughed just like they were good together! I realized that laugh could change everything. It could change not only the inside the relationship but also how people view your realationship.Laughters do help us out a lot.

21608	8	"One thing that people in the world love to do the most is laugh. Why is it that we like to laugh? Laughter is every important in our lives because it brings us joy, happiness, and most of all it just fills our stomachs with butterflies. One major thing that about laughter is the whole point of view. Of course everyone makes jokes, dorky things, or simply a funny comment. All those things cause laughter, sometimes laughter helps people grow a good relationship and it builds up to be strong.  In relationships like boyfriend/girlfriend, parents with their children, family, or even friends have to have some laughter in their relationship because if not then that would be a boring relationship. At times it's hard to bring laughter in the picture but we at least need to try to laugh it is healthy for us to laugh once in a while. In families its important to grow a relationship with the child or parents and they need some funny feelings in their stomachs that make them giggly inside and its all could laughter. Friends always will have funny moments to laugh about, it's sometimes the pranks that they do to each other, the funny comments, the jokes and it's easy as that to start laughing and creating the good relationship with just laughing with each other.   Sometimes laughter could cause bad things if we use for bad things and that could cause a bad relationship. We also don't want to hurt someone's feelings by laughing at them because something that happen or if someone made a comment, because that could leave us not laughing to much after we loose a relationship with someone. The smiles that people have on their faces is a wonderful thing to see. In all relationships laughter is a big thing because it can always come in handle. People have bad days sometimes and we always try to make them happy and how do we do that, well it's called laughing. I know if I was having a bad day and I felt all depressed and mushy I would like someone to make me laugh by simply saying a hilarious joke.  In my personal opinion I love laughing and especially making people around me laugh. At times I have my bad times and need some laughter in my system to make me feel at least better. I know that sadness can sometimes take over but we all need to think positive and not let the negative things take over. Life is so much better if we all have laughter in them. Imagine the world with just laughter, how life would be. i wish that could happen because that would make everyone full of happiness and smiles on the faces.   In my personal life my family and friends are full of laughter. I have to make jokes at times when things are getting diffcult and everyone is freaking out. Laughter is a part of us either we like it or not it's always going to be with us no matter what. Eventually I would say that laughter is a element in my life that I will always carry and I hope that everyone in the world has the element of laughter in them because seriously it's important in this this world."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21610	8	" People always say that the worst parts of life are the sad parts, the moments where no one is there to make you laugh or smile. These sad moments trump the problems caused by work, or by the society, and show how important laughter is in our lives. A time when someone is feeling joy so strong that it pours out of them in the way of a suppressed giggle or booming laugh, are the times that make life worth living, worth the jobs and the bad breakups and the over priced society. It has been said by those infamous ""they"" that your worst most tragic moments are the ones remembered forever because they hold the most emotion, but i have to disagree with ""them"". Moments in the life whether they be seconds, hours, weeks or years, can be cherished also if they are built up by the bonds of love and laughter. Just recently was my birthday. This year it fell on a @DATE1 and I had made no plans to celebrate in any way. Sure my parents had gotten me loads of presents but the joy and jittery excitement that i had always felt previous to my birthday wasn't in me. These feelings were most likely because this year i had decided that now that i was in high school, birthday parties were a no go. With no plans or exciting activities to await, my birthday was not eagerly looked forward to as it had been every year previous. What would i do?! I definitely didn't want to spend the day home in my pajamas with my parents and two sisters, that's what i did almost every other normal @DATE1. These thoughts and realizations brought that sad lonely feeling in me, those feelings that make up the worst parts of life. My mom, noticing my birthday gloom, suggested a trip to the beach and a one night stay in a yurt. I love the beach, I would even go as far as to say that its my favorite place in the world. I also love yurts. Yurts are big round cabins made from canvas draped around a wood structure, with a skylight directly at the top of the pointed roof where you could see the stars at night. Staying in a yurt at the beach sounded better to me then being at home, so naturally I agreed to the beach trip. Way deep down I was excited, I was thrilled, a beach trip with my family! In my head I was stuck still in my foggy state of gloom as thoughts swirled in my head about how I would not have a good time if there were no friends to laugh and hang out with, and how much of a loser I was for not doing anything with friends but instead my family. Our household consists of my mom, dad, and two sisters ages four and @NUM1 months. We are not the most well functioning family. I find my older sister to be an annoying brat sent by the devil to ruin my life and make everything my fault. Two out of the three of us girls have to always be in some kind of brawl, and that drives my mother crazy which gets her all flustered and my dad angry until we realize that buzz light year has ruffled all of our feathers. This scene is exactly what I imagined my family birthday beach trip to turn out like, but caused by a long car drive and hungry kids rather than buzz light year.  The day approached and we woke early to pack our bags and pack the car. My mom, bless her, made a family announcement to us that today was my day and anything I wanted was what I got. This meant that I got to choose what we would eat, what we would do and could make any comment including telling my little sisters to bug off if i wanted to. By lunch, we had visited the beach, gotten settled in our yurt, and enjoyed a lunch made up of various snacks we had brought along and I found that I was enjoying myself. No one had fought all day, raised a voice, make a snarky comment or do anything to upset the happy atmosphere we were in. I was laughing. As we visited the aquarium with all its odd fish i laughed. I laughed at my sisters when they were doing silly things. I laughed at the things my mother told me. We all laughed at a bicyclist running into a pole, and fish doing vacuum like motions with their lips. All the laughing, all the smiles did a lot for me. It pushed those negative thoughts straight out of my mind and told them never to come back. Laughing helped me to see all of the love that circled around in my family, it made the love visible. Its healthy to laugh. Without laughter in our lives, some things like love, that can sometimes be invisible, become visible again through laughter. "	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	4	4						
21617	8	" Morose and somnolent, I woke up. I woke up to go to @LOCATION1. Going to @LOCATION1 to watch a few basketball games, I was. Although I was unable to partake in the activity because I was @CAPS1 injured in the previous week of practice. Unfortunately though, I still had to go and support my friends and teammates. It was about @NUM1 o'clock when we all got onto the bus and set off to @LOCATION1. All of my friends were mirthful and talkative; but me on the other hand, I was in a lackadaisical stare. The bus ride seemed to last a whole lifetime; but in two hours we arrived at our destination. @LOCATION1 had a nice school; but we were all about to find that it sometimes resembled a ghost town. The high school seemed lifeless in comparison with other schools we had played at in the past. There was nobody around and not a soul to be heard. We all sat there patiently waiting; then, after maybe five minutes or so a man showed up and led us to the locker rooms. The boys had to wait till the girls were done playing their game; so, we all went and started shooting on one of the auxiliary courts. Although, sadly due to my injury I could not participate in the activity. They were all having so much fun screwing around down there. Just the thought of not being down there with them made me ill. After the girls game we all went to change. After that we all sat there, joking around and waiting for our coach to come in and give us our pre-game pep talk. It seemed like ages before our coach finally came into the locker room. He talked about what we should and shouldn't do in order to get the win. When the game started I was really getting depressed, but I sucked it up and cheered on my team. The first half of the game was great and we were on top. Although the second half wasn't so great. We only scored six points and ended up losing the game by a large margin. My friends tried to be stoical; but I could tell that they were ashamed. Ashamed of their performance in the second half. This once again made me feel sad and depressed. Next, I had no choice but to go and watch two more games in the old, vulgar, and uncomfortable bleachers of @LOCATION1. The first of the two games was a great one; we won by two points. The next game on the other hand, was a very boring one. It seemed to take forever; but the worst of it was the fact that we lost. After that final game I had to wait for my cousin to come out from the locker room. When he did, we went to check out with our coaches; we had to check out in order to ride home with our parents. So off we went; but first we had to get something to eat. Once again, like all the times before we chose to eat at @ORGANIZATION1. We went through the drive through, got our food, then pulled over so we could eat. At first everything seemed right; but then my cousin noticed he didn't receive the @CAPS2 he ordered. So we went in to get the problem solved. Afterwords, we were all kind of joking about the restaurant not getting the order right; then I took a bite of my burger. It was then that I realized I had received a burger without a patty. I was really upset that @ORGANIZATION1's made such a silly mistake. So once more me and my cousin went in to the restaurant. When told what the problem was they were all just in shock. They couldn't believe what they had done. So after they all settled down they made me another burger.  Me and and the family were all having a ball about the events at the @ORGANIZATION1. It was a great trip home fillled with lots of fun and laughter; which was not what me, my cousin, or anybody else expected.So in the end of my once gloomy day, I found myself stricken with laughter."	18	18		36				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
21626	8	" In most stories mothers and daughters are either enemies or friends, in @CAPS13 story however, we are both enemies and friends well; at one point we were that way. Not @CAPS4 much anymore. I'm sixteen now and she's forty and were just friends, I mean she's still @CAPS13 mom and she still can punish me as her daughter as she pleases but we work it all out and laugh it off. Approximately seven months ago @CAPS13 mom moved from @LOCATION4 to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 I chose to stay behind to finish high school with @CAPS13 current friends. When she moved, the way we acted with eachother would be different, and it is, we act completely different with each other we now cherish the little time we have and I'll explain how. At the beginning since as early as I can remember, @CAPS13 mother and I would always fight over the dumbest things, we never got along. And here is what I think the reason is. I'm her daughter I was born just like her, her face, hair, eyes, everything, even @CAPS13 attitude and the sound of @CAPS13 laugh. She's stubborn I'm stubborn and we both like to argue, not really with other people just with us two, but if we were to go into business together things would get done, say if we became lawyers we'd work great together because I inherited her work ethic and we both like to argue valid points. But as I grew up a bit more and we experienced traumatic times together we began to see the brighter side of life, and that just having each other around is enough to keep us from falling apart. Events in our life that we went through brought us together @CAPS1 it was all finished and done. What I mean by that, is we stopped arguing, we comforted each other when we needed comfort, we became friends, and I believe laughter had a lot to do with it.  @CAPS13 mom, her name by the way is @LOCATION5, once said ""Laughter brings two people together as a whole, the one thing that human beings all know how to do is laugh and its something we can all share."" @CAPS1 our life had settled down and we were able to live normal, like with a house and lights and a dog with a yard, things were good between us we still fought often but never as it used to be. Which would consist of throwing objects across the room at each other, like I said things are better now. We one night discovered, that laughter is something we both use to block out the things we no longer wanted to haunt us. I love to sing, @CAPS13 mother and @CAPS11 had me grow up around music like; The @CAPS2, @LOCATION3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and many others but we would sing a song together something that only the two of us shared and it was ""@CAPS3're @CAPS4 @CAPS5"" by @PERSON3. But we would sing that specific song in the car, we would sing it in front of our family and @CAPS1 the moment was over we would laugh about it, because for once was something that only @CAPS13 mom and I shared and it was special. Laughter played a big part of who we are as people today. There are always things people do together, @CAPS13 mom grew up in a strict @CAPS6 @CAPS7 home, she also had four sister's and @CAPS8 was a very serious matter. @CAPS13 mom and I went to @CAPS8 together and we always tried not to take life @CAPS4 seriously all the time, @CAPS4 while in @CAPS8 we would start @CAPS15 about some kind of ugly bug on the wall, or she would laugh at me because I would drop the prayer book on @CAPS13 foot, but we would always laugh."" @CAPS10 it or I'll bring @CAPS11 @CAPS12 over here and @CAPS3'll have to take an extra religion class.""@CAPS13 mom would say as I'm poking her or making fun of her and i would say "" @CAPS14 wont make me take an extra class I'll tell him @CAPS3 started it."" That's who @CAPS13 mom and I were and were still like that. Even though she moved to @LOCATION2 for a new job, and @CAPS4 she could see the man she loves more often than every six months, we still talk, and like I said we laugh when we cry and boy do we cry a lot, especially on the phone when I tell her I miss her.  That is the story of @CAPS13 mother and the laughter that we have shared for the last sixteen years, and to quote @PERSON1 ""@CAPS15 is the best calorie burner."" I do believe that and @CAPS13 mom and I see it as that, @CAPS15 is the one thing we can do when we don't feel @CAPS4 hot or don't feel like ourselves, @CAPS4 yes she is correct when she states that laughter brings two people together, and it's positively true, we have a better relationship than ever."	17	18		35				4	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3

Whether it was about something stupid I did, or my best friend doing something stupid, or most of the time when we got together and did something outrageous. Someone once said ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"". With my best friend @ORGANIZATION2 and I, that's exactly the case. I always get a good ab workout whenever I'm with her, because I'm always bursting with laughter. It was my @NUM3 grade year at @ORGANIZATION1 here in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION3. I was hanging out with my best friend @ORGANIZATION2 during our lunch break outside. I was showing her my new jeans I'd just gotten the day before, at @LOCATION2. I was also telling her about a note that had been passed to me, by a boy who had apparently had a crush on me for sometime, this boy had also asked me out on the note. @ORGANIZATION2 had asked me if she could see it, when I handed it over to her, all of a sudden, she chucked the note over the fence. Clearly, the guy didn't have @ORGANIZATION2's approval. I couldn't just leave the guy hanging without an answer, especially when at the time, I liked him back. I begged @ORGANIZATION2 to give me my note back, but she refused. What was I supposed to do, just let an unanswered note lay on the other side of the fence? No. The only solution was to hop over the fence and grab it. So I, in my new jeans might I add, practically straddled the fence, and ripped a big hole on the inner side of my thigh, in my brand new jeans. I was so mad. I grabbed the note, and climbed back over the fence in my new and improved hobo jeans. On my way back over, I lost my balance, and fell of the fence. I ended up losing the note again and planting head first into a pile of mud and pine cones.  What an idiot I was, I'd climbed over that stupid fence, ripped my jeans, biffed it and lost my balance, and lost it again. I was so frustrated with myself, I started laughing. I'm not sure if it was because I was embarrassed or what, but I randomly started cracking up. Then @ORGANIZATION2 started laughing, and when she laughs I laugh, because her laughter is so contagious. Pretty soon, we were both hysterically laughing like a couple of dorks. ""Laughter really was the shortest distance between two people"" that day. Even though I probably should have been mad.... But why do that when @CAPS1 can just laugh about it? That's what life is all about, living. With this silly but funny memory, it'll stay with me forever. Especially now that @ORGANIZATION2 has moved away. It @MONTH1 seem stupid, but it was funny to us. I guess it really was one of those ""@CAPS1 had to be there"" kind of moments. But it reminds me of the good old days with @ORGANIZATION2. It's good to have memories filled with laughter. If @CAPS1 don't, your life can almost feel dull without it. Even if @CAPS1 laugh at just the smallest things in life. That's why to me anyways, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people""."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
21633	8	" Many people believe that laughter can improve your life. Laughing lets out endorphins that give your body energy for daily activities. Relationships are usually better if both the people are happy. Happiness is like shaking up a soda bottle. Happy emotions build up in your body and when shaken, release with an explosion of positive emotions such as laughing. When I was born, my mother said that I was the most chubby baby in the world. As she said this, she laughed, in constant thought that I will eventually become a young adult. I giggled in the backseat of the car as we drove home together. I was taught by my mother, who laughed all the time until her eyes were full of tears, to laugh at every chance I had. Through my years as an infant, I giggled, chuckled, and laughed my way to adolescence. As I moved into adolescence, I was diagnosed with @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1, a mild autistic @CAPS1 that has a variation of side effects. Some people who have @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1 develop cases where their emotions do not show physically. This case is similar to the physical features of @CAPS3 @CAPS1. My main case with having @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1 is that I do not receive all the information given to me at one time. When people tell me a joke that they think is hilarious, I tend to miss the important parts of the joke, which are funny. As the joke comes to an end, everybody around me is laughing, but I am standing there with a blank look on my face. Sometimes I tell people I cannot laugh. Though I say this, I know it is not true. I can laugh, it is just really hard for me to find the right time. Most times, I laugh at a situation that really is not funny and everybody else has a blank gaze on their face. This usually makes me feel embarrassed and I don't feel normal. A lot of people tell me I look expressionless and then try to perk me up, or smile. I don't feel the need to smile, even in happy times in my life. I have not laughed enough, but have been learning in how to make bad situations into great and happy ones. Learning that at any moment I can laugh is important. Even if there is no joke being told, I can laugh. Most people would probably look a me in a weird way, but I wouldn't care because I am the one that feels happiness inside. Laughing relieves stress, makes other people feel good, and allows people with mental disabilities to feel more comfortable in the community they live in. I have finally learned that even with @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1, I can laugh just as much as anyone."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
